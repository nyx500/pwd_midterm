***I tried to reread it July 2022, and I still don’t like it so moving on! I just can’t with this book. I don’t get the hype. Everyone annoyed me and I don’t care. Maybe I’ll try again later, but I don’t know. I don’t feel like listening to a bunch of people that sound like little kids arguing and acting stupid. It might change but I don’t have time and I don’t care. Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
