Review from 2022:Obsessed, 10/10, immaculate, stunning, incredible, amazing, one of a kind Review from 2021: It’s been so long since a book won me over from the very first paragraph, but this book was exactly that experience for me. The writing style of this just screams dark academia - kind of pretentious while also being presented as if completely standard, because of course to these characters, it is. I loved that you see these characters be ambitious, learn about their magic, and all the way through hold a wariness that wasn’t dropped for a second. It made for such a gritty story, and definitely an interesting one when it comes to picking sides.I will say that the ending for me - literally the final two or three chapters - fell a little bit flat for me, largely because I saw the key aspect of it coming. And this, in itself, was due to the one thing I would fault about this book - a repetition when it came to the character descriptions. At first I only saw this as slightly tedious in the way certain traits kept being brought back up, but then I clocked on to a phrase that kept being mentioned that made me suspicious, and was ultimately right. I’m not the sort to actively try and guess the way a story would go and quite often it all goes over my head, so I’m quite surprised I caught it quite so accurately in the end. That being said, it still made for a great story. I took far longer to read this one than I usually would, largely because I would put off reading it from not wanting it to end. I love a character driven story, and this is certainly it. It managed to feel intense even when not that much was happening, and the allure of the Alexandrian society was definitely felt. I can’t wait to see where this series goes, and to read more from these characters because wow, it’s messy in the best and most entertaining way.
