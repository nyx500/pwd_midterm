As someone who is not super familiar with the Arthur legend besides what is known in pop culture, I’m not sure how this would be received by fans of the legend. This retelling is a mix of nature magic, elemental beings, and some gender-swapping and other twists on the original characters. This did read a little younger than I was expecting as Guinevere is 16 and acts like it with her naivety. She seems to not follow threads that will probably be obvious to most readers. There is a love triangle (this is the Arthur legend after all) but I didn’t feel particularly drawn to the romance in this either. There are some questions not answered in this book but I don’t know if I’ll be intrigued enough to continue when the next installment in the series comes around.
