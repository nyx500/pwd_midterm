Don't pick this up unless you were very bummed about finishing the Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, the Silmarillion, and other greats -- and are craving more. So much that you're willing to essentially sit back in a college-level literary analysis course.The stories are magical, and definitely "Tolkienesque", but at times it can be a tough read.That's primarily because most of what Christopher Tolkien (J.R.R.'s son) used to put this -- not to mention the rest of the History of Middle-Earth series -- together were fragments of stories, sometimes three or more different versions.There is a lot of academic-style commentary, complete with name comparisons, investigations of intentional vs. scrapped pieces of story, notes of geography of Middle-Earth gleaned from the tales, and so on.If you don't like that kind of commentary, go ahead and skip right to the stories. But be warned that they'll be bit confusing to piece into the Middle-Earth we know and love, and you will lose context of what's going on to understand why C. Tolkien arranged the book the way that he did.
