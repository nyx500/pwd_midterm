Easily the driest of Tolkien's back catalog that I've read thus far - which Christopher Tolkien himself mentions in the foreword! (I've read the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, the three Great Tales and the Tales from the Perilous Realm collection beyond The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings thus far). 2.5/5
