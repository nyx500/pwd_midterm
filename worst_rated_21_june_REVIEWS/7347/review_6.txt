Okay, this is kind of tough to rate. If I could split hairs on this I would only rate it 3.5, but ultimately this is Tolkien, whose ideas become the genesis of so much I enjoyed from childhood on (D&D, high fantasy, sword and sorcery, you get the idea), it gets rounded up to 4. If it were just Tolkien's work, it would be a solid 4, even though I confess there was a lot of it that did not absorb for me on my first reading here. (I usually have to read a Tolkien volume 3 times before I feel like I really have a grasp of it.)And that's where I really thought this particular volume fell short--the "editing" by Christopher Tolkien. I was hoping that would offer a more cogent analysis, something more clearly and concisely written that might help me navigate through some of the denser ideas. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate what Christopher Tolkien set out to do. But I needed the commentary to be more cogent than it was. And in looking at his own author profile I now have a better understanding as to what he was up against trying to bring materials written long-hand on paper, erased, then written over again on the same paper. So I get it. It was a monumental task. I just found it a bit dense too and it would have been more helpful if it had been like the commentary on the movies. (That's just my opinion). For example, I found the discussions about gnomes problematic and did not answer some of the most basic questions that popped into my head. Another issue I had was one that I really can't fault anyone but the publisher. In several instances they try to draw comparisons to storylines or content that was also in the Silmarillion. They would cite to a page in the Silmarillion for reference. How they thought that would be helpful when there are so many versions and publications and republications is beyond me. There's no way I would be able to track down the material to which they were actually citing. At some point I will re-read this, I'm sure.
