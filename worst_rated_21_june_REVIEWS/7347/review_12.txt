I had thought that this book was a bunch of stories in the Tolkien mythology that had never been published. It was only after picking this book up at the library that I discovered what it actually is. After his father died, Christopher Tolkien first compiled, edited, and published The Silmarillion and then later made this twelve volume (yes, twelve!) set of what is essentially all of his father's unpublished and generally unfinished writings. This first book is what eventually was rewritten as The Silmarillion, but how Tolkien had first envisioned the telling of the story, as a man named Eriol who stumbles upon an elfin island and bids everyone he meets to tell him their history of the world. I've read the Silmarillion a couple of times, so I'm generally pretty familiar with the story. This is like reading Tolkien's first draft of The Silmarillion, which is a little bit weird. After each chapter, Christopher Tolkien describes how each story evolved into the final story in The Silmarillion. Ultimately, I think it's a better idea to read the author's final work rather than early drafts, but it's a little bit interesting to see how Tolkien changed various stories over time.Really, this is only a book for people who are very well acquainted with the story of Middle Earth and want more insight into Tolkien's literary practice. I would even say that it doesn't make much sense to read this unless you've read The Silmarillion more than once.
