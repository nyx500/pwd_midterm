If you want to know more about the prehistory of The Lord of the Rings, want to delve into old and long forgotten tales, this is the right collection for you. You read about how the world was created, who the gods were, hear about Tulkas, Valinor and the evil Melko (brilliant character). Each tale has a comment and plenty of explanation. There are even poems included and thousands of strange sounding names. For every Ring fan an absolute must read. The tales often reminded me on nordic myths. This is pure escapism. Highly recommended, though a bit difficult with all the annotations, glossary, comments and notes.
