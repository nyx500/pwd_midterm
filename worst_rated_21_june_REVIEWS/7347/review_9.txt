I've been wanting to start this massive series, The History of Middle-Earth, for a long, long time. Because as anyone knows, I bloody love Tolkien and Middle-Earth.However, it took me a while to start, mostly because I don't have more than the first two books yet and I have a feeling that I'll be wanting to read book 3 right after I finish book 1.Now, book 1.If you have read The Silmarillion, you'll know that it is largely the story of the elves, their origins and such. Way, way before the events of our beloved The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. And if you have read Silmarilion, you'll find that you might recognise the stories in this book, as they would later become The Silmarillion -- along with part II.This book offers an insight into the crafting of the massive and historically intricate universe that is Middle-Earth. And as such, I can't help but like it. Even if I might prefer the eventual "finished" stories of The Silmarillion.For more thoughts on Lost Tales, you can check out my review of Part II, here.Also reviewed together on my blog Bookish Love Affair.
