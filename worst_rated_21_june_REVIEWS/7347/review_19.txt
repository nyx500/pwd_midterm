It's great wen you can read the first and fresh versions of what will once become the world of Middle-earth and how story was changed and how it will be if it was not. And of course all followed by Christoper's comments. Thank you for sharing, Christopher and thank you for being such a beautiful weird human being with a wonderful brain, Mr. Tolkien.
