'The Book of Lost Tales' is an interesting reflection on the thought processes of a writer. Imagine not just writing one of the greatest fantasy epics in the form of 'The Lord of the Rings', but also writing the entire mythology and history leading up to the events of the novel so that there is a clear sense of history in Middle Earth.Is 'The Book of Lost Tales' an easy read? Definitely not. The book is densely written and, as Christopher Tolkien points out many times within its pages, is often amended and overwritten to clarify the writer's thoughts. In this first part, there is a sense of the Creation mythology of two races that never existed in a world that is not our own. Thought provoking in its broad strokes, it also carries a sense of the oral tradition. These words were never meant to be read, but to be heard around smoky campfires while hiding from orcs and dark riders.The only drawback is that 'The Book of Lost Tales' does not feel as if it was ever intended to be published. These are rough notes for Tolkien to keep Middle Earth alive and developing in his imagination and many could say that these are nothing more than glorified jottings with no usefulness other than to the writer. However, insomuch as it gives an insight into the creative process of any writer, 'The Book of Lost Tales' is extremely interesting and Christopher Tolkien's editorial notes and commentaries are invaluable.
