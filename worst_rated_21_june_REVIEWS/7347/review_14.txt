Rating: 3 starsThe Book of Lost Tales, Part 1 is a great book to read before going to sleep, not because it was mind numbingly boring that you can't keep your eyes open after reading a couple pages, but because Tolkien's writing style is so calming. That being said, one really needs to grasp the earlier stories, because the vast majority flow on directly (so much so that they could barely be called separate tales). Not sure when exactly, but I will be getting to Part 2 sometime in the future.
