Early version of the Silmarillion, the focus being the episodes regarding the Valar and Valinor. Covers the story of creation, the fiefdoms of the Valar, the arrival of the Eldar and the flight of the Noldor, and ends with the discovery of Men. Corresponds well with the Silmarillion's version except for extraneous details. Prodigious pages are notes by Christopher Tolkien. Plot events are moving, dramatic or humorous at turns but are swaddled by thick swatches of setting descriptions or laborious high epic / high fantasy vocabulary, which depending on personal taste can be an additional appeal or additional Herculean labor of reading the book. The audience that abides with this book to the end can be somewhat limited.
