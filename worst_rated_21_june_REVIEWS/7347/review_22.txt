The obvious reason for reading this is being a fan of Tolkien. It is fun to compare the earliest extant version of the Silmarillion. As Christopher Tolkien points out, the distance felt while reading the Silmarillion, and one of the things that makes it such an effective work, is completely missing here. There is a mediator, Eriol, who arrives at a cottage and recieves the stories of the gods and elves in much the same way as Chaucer's travelers receieved their tales on the road. If you enjoy different types of reading experiences, then this is an interesting way to read the Silmarillion. But it becomes very clear that the latter is the far superior work.The one thing I wish Tolkien had kept was the character of Melko as found in the Lost Tales. It is a far more subtle creature who lurks about wreaking havoc versus the later, known enemy.Finally, there are many compositional gems (no pun intended) to be found here, regardless of its unpolished form. For example, in the Silmarillion, when Melkor begins to thwart the singing of the Ainur, it is said that Eru takes even the most triumphant notes and weaves them into his own pattern. In the Lost Tales, he writes, "...yet ever, as it essayed to clash most fearsomely, finding itself but in some manner supplementing or harmonising with its rival." This is a little more wordy, but I love the sense it conveys of free will and sovereignty co-existing. In the Silmarillion, Iluvatar "takes". Here, somehow, these evil notes "find" themselves supplementing or harmonising with the original song. This is the first of the history of Middle Earth series I have read. Overall, recommended.
