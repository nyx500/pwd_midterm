Having read The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion many times since I was a teen, as well as Tolkien's papers, letters, and biographies, I decided it was time to go the last mile and read his son Christopher's annotated compilation of the Professor's earlier drafts. BoLT/I is the first of the five-volume collection. It covers topics familiar to anyone who has read The Silmarillion--the creation of the world, the making of Valinor, the Valars' conflict with Melkor, the Awakening of the Elves, and the Coming of Men--but in some of the earlier drafts the details vary greatly with the "canonical" versions. What's more, all the tales in this volume are presented as having been told around a fire to Eriol, a traveler visiting the Elves living on the island of Tol Eressea. Chritospher explains how that island, in his father's imagination, was an analog to the English county of Warwickshire, and bolsters the claims of those that the Shire was an allegorical representation of England, and Middle-Earth as a whole was analogical to Europe (though the Professor vehemently denied the latter). In the tales--and most particularly in Christopher Tolkien's very careful commentary--one can also trace the evolution of the Quenya and Sindarin languages. I had often wondered where the various Elvish dictionaries got their extensive word lists from, since so little was presented in the canon; now I know, and am thrilled to find such a trove of vocabulary.
