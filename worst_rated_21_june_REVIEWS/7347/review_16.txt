This will be my 12-volume write-up of the entire series "The History of Middle Earth".--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This series is ONLY for the hardcore Tolkien fanatic. Predominantly written byJRR's son, based on JRR's notes on the creation of The Silmarilion andThe Lord of the Rings (much less on The Hobbit). It is somewhat interesting tosee the evolution of the story (for example, "Strider" was originally conceived asa Hobbit (one of those who "went off into the blue with Gandalf" as alluded toin The Hobbit). But the downside to this is that it isn't very fun to read. You can only read yetanother version of Beren and Luthien so many times before you're tired of seeingthe miniscule changes from one version to the next.So, overall, I slogged through this over about a year. I'd say it was worth itin the end for someone like me who loves Tolkien and his entire created worldof Arda (and Ea in general). But I'll never re-read them. They come off too muchas seeming like Christopher Tolkien just bundled every scrap of paper he could find,rather than thinning them down into a logical consistency.
