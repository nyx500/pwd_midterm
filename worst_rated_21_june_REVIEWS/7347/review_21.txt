This is archaeology in book form. Christopher Tolkien has compiled early drafts of his father's writings. Some are complete stories--others not so much. This is the first of twelve volumes in The History of Middle-earth. I've read a few individual volumes of HoMe in the past, but never all of them and not this one. It covers stories like the Music of the Ainur, Melko (later Melkor/Morgoth) and his rebellion, and the creation of the Silmarils, as well as the Trees of Valinor and later the creation of the Sun and Moon. In other words, the first few chapters of the Silmarillion. But these early drafts are quite different from the final stories. The narrative structure was also different. Tolkien early on conceived of these ancient stories being told to a Man by Elves in later days when he sailed West and found the Lonely Isle where Elves still are. Even in rough form, the stories are still interesting. Tolkien knows how to write epic myths, that's for sure! There's also a lot of notes and commentary and yes, it can be dry at times when discussing linguistic evolution of the place and character names. Also, my version of the History of Middle-earth is all twelve volumes in just three giant hard cover books. So this first book, although not that long, required me to hold this huge tome that is not ideal for cuddling. ðŸ˜” Oh well, it looks great on the shelf!! One down, 11 to go in the History of Middle-earth!
