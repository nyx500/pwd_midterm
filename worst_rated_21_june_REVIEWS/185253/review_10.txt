This isn't pathbreaking fantasy, and it suffers from issues of pacing, prose and characterisation, but it's an engaging and sometimes moving story for all that. A coming of age novel set in a fantastic world (aren't they all?), The Magic Of Recluce often seems bogged down in diurnal detail: meals at inns, distances travelled, long hours of discomfort, but I can also see how Modesitt felt the need to include these things as a way to ground his fantasy narrative, give it a lived-in feel. The prose itself is serviceable, but ever so slightly awkward. Sometimes it's hard to tell exactly which character is being referred to, or who just spoke and Modessit's reliance on onomatopoeia to convey action can get tiresome as well as opaque. The characters are broad archetypes to the point of cliche, but Modesitt goes beyond the traditional gender roles of a lot of fantasy.Despite the fact that things often move too slowly for the narrative's good, the plot is actually very well shaped and highly effective, setting up a central conflict and then successively raising the stakes, along with interludes to gather energy. It all builds up to a magnificent sorcercous confrontation in a forbidden castle - pure fantasy overdrive. Along the way, we're exposed to complex and compelling political currents and an interesting, nuanced conception of magic. This book also features the single most awesome pony in all of fantastic fiction.So there you go: a middling epic fantasy novel that offers an interesting take on magic, a richly imagined world, a predictable but exciting plot, some infelicities of style and a certain shallowness of charaterisation. Quite a few rungs above Eddings and certainly more genuinely imaginative and original than Jordan.
