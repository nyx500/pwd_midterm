I'm sorry to say that this book was a DNF for me! I'm so disappointed that I didn't like this one, I really tried to give it a fair go, and I read about halfway through, but to be honest it was stressing me out and I had to leave it!It wasn't all negative as I really did enjoy the beginning of the book. The Magic of Recluce is written in first person, and the downfall of this narration can be that it makes a book lack world building. There was none of that here! Modesitt showed himself to be skilled at world building and really weaved in beautiful details of culture and scenery into the narrative. I mean the food that was described left my mouth watering!The main issue for me was that I really disliked the main character, Lerris. From the very beginning he does not stop moaning about everything. He finds everything boring and annoying. He constantly complained, mostly because he was never given any answers and wanted everything told to him, okay at times this was a valid reason, but it was still so frustrating to read. It actually made me bored! I know that later on Lerris does improve, but by then I really didn't care.Another one of my biggest problems was that Modesitt used sound effects to describe things. He would use phrases like 'thwack' for fight scenes and 'wheeee eeee' to describe the sound of a horse!! My God did this piss me off! I mean it was one 'kapow' away from being like a 60s Batman tv episode! Not good! If you're going to give me a battle scene, give me the details, give me a scene to visualise. Don't give me a 'thwack' and bits of broken up conversation!Anyway I'm still glad I tried a new author, I mean you don't know until you try right?
