I debated the rating on this and went with 4.The above was my original review of this book, I'm a little surprised that it got a vote (LOL). I'm also a little surprised at my comment. In retrospect I like the book much better than my initial impression above. Over the years, the book has apparently gotten better LOL. It stayed with me and I own most of the series...I like it and the series a great deal. I read this book a good many years ago and it launched me off into tracking down the Recluse books or snatching them up as they came out. Modesitt is one of those interesting people who can turn out a lot of books and still have the quality stay high. These are a fantastic fantasy series and worth the read. It rests heavily on character development (though some disagree about this I think the character/s are well drawn and interesting). This/these books have an interesting and "fairly" original magic system that he builds onto rather well later. Second update:I just reread this novel (again) with a group read here and have decided to up the rating to 5 stars. While others have expressed negative opinions of the book it seems every time I read it I like it better. I will note one thing. This time I "read" the audio version of the book. a couple of the other readers in the group noted that all the sound effects in the book annoyed them,(biff, splush, zingggg, swish, etc.). I suppose that I just read over these the first time I read the book as I sometimes do obscenities, oaths or whatever. This time both the fact that I'm listening to the audio and the fact that they had been brought to my attention caused me to notice them. I have to admit there are a lot of them, however far from annoying me now when I hear the exceptional number of sound effects, I tend to crack up. As the boots pulled out of the mud or the wood broke or whatever I'd laugh out loud just noticing it.So, yeah lots of sound effects but still a deeply characterized story and very well told.
