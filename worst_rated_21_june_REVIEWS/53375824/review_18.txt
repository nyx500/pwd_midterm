Kicking off 2021 with a return to goodreads and this book! Loved the story and the Greek mythology, and really thought the idea of the Agon was cool. The romance kept me going though the flashbacks made the story feel a bit choppy. Either way though, I kept wanting to come back and read more which is always a good sign. :-)
