This was one of my most highly anticipated releases of 2021 and the synopsis was amazing, but unfortunately, this book was a huge letdown. It was unnecessarily dense and confusing. Not to mention the romance was boring because the characters were meh. I could feel the reading slump creeping in while I was reading this. It started off great but I just lost interest at around the 25% mark and never got invested in it at all after that.
