If we do not end the Agon, it will end us.✅ Greek mythology✅ Action✅ Strong and independent main character✅ Some plot twists🆗 Characters🆗 Romance🆗 Villain🆗❌ Plot. Very confusing first few chapters, but the rest is good 3.5 starsI enjoyed reading this book, it is a good balance of action, mystery, romance, and scheming. There are a few plot twists, and the characters are nice. I wanted to give this book a higher rating, but honestly, the first chapters are quite confusing and we get thrown into the action very quickly, without having a chance to really know the characters. Also, the bad guy is just so generic and shallow... The rest is good though! The author mixed greek mythology and urban fantasy in a very nice way. I have not read that many books about greek mythology, so it was really intriguing and interesting from the first chapter. This book has a hunger game vibe, but instead of being teenagers killing each other, it's hunters killing gods to take their powers. The setting also reminded me of The Mortal Instrument series. Both books are about a magical part of society that is hidden and known only by a handful of people (and both stories happen in New York). I admit that the beginning is confusing. I had trouble differentiating all the families and understanding how exactly the Agon works (who can take the power of the god, who is hunting which god, etc.), but I pushed through it and it became clearer in the fourth chapter. The list of all the families and their important members helped, but it really was a struggle to get invested in the story at first. You definitely need to take some notes if you want to have a clear picture.Lore is a nice character (once you get to know her, which does take a while). She can take care of herself, is a fierce fighter, but still has a good heart and all she wants is to live a quiet life far away from the Gods and hunters after being the only survivor of the massacre of her family seven years ago. She ends up being part of the Agon once again because of unforeseen events, and we can see how conflicted she is. She wants revenge for the murder of her family, but she also wants to protect the quiet life she built for herself in the last 7 years. She realizes that she can't be part of both worlds, and she needs to find a way to stop the Agon for good if she hopes to live a normal life.“I was born knowing how to do three things – how to breathe, how to dream, and how to love you.”The romance in Lore is cute, but somehow it did not satisfy me, I don't know if it's because of the fast development or the pace of the book... It is a sweet "childhood friends to lovers" story and it added a cute touch to the book. At first, I was not sure about the place that the romance would hold in this book, since the beginning is all about fighting, revenge, killing, and trying to survive for the Agon week, but the author did a good job of showing how the badass girl and the sweet boy completed each other and how they'd had feelings for each other for years. They are adorable.Overall, I was expecting more from this book, I still feel that parts of the plot are weak, due to the generic villain and the unoriginal quest for power, but I still enjoyed reading this book, and I would recommend it.Fanarts by Mariamarcelw and Runningquill-artFollow me on Instagram 🙂
