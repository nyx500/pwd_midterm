The Bone Witch (The Bone Witch #1) by Rin Chupeco is one of the best fantasy books I have read in the last few years, and I read a lot of books! This book is rich in how the author weaves the story's multiple levels, the characters, the many subtle things that come up later that if you don't really pay attention to it, you would miss it. I read really fast but for this book, I read very slowly and reread parts over, something I never do! This book has so much in it that you might miss if you read too fast or not paying attention to it. There is the dark magic, lighter magic, oracles, the resurrected, creatures like no others, suspense, action, and told so well I felt I was there. I stayed up all night to absorb it all. I could not stop, I felt I was under a compulsion spell. This book needs to be on the big screen for all to see, not just readers. Tea, our gal of the story, is too young to get her heartstone but she does something that gets everyone's attention. Her older brother dies and in grief, she resurrects him from the dead. She is no ordinary witch like her sisters, she is a powerful asha, a dark witch, a bone witch. Someone feared and loved at the same time. Someone that will be trained to kill the creatures that hunt man. That is the plan at least... There will be more books, I hope, I can't wait. I will stay up all night to read those also! This story takes the girl from about age 12 or so to age 17 and a lot happens in that time, but she is not done telling us the whole story! Wow, this book is powerful. Loved the plot, the mysteries, the characters, the fantasy of it all. Thanks NetGalley for allowing me to read such an awesome book. Also, even though I only got this book from NetGalley and didn't buy it, I was still allowed to get the Asha Apprentice Card download. It is so pretty. I could print it out but I put it as my screen saver. AWESOME! I don't know how anyone could not see this as anything less than a 10 star book out of 5 stars! lol
