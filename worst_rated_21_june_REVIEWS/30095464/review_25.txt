This was an okay read. It had moments of promise built in an intricate world. The problem is it often slogs down into information dumps and overly descriptive sections that seem to roll on and on. I am typically a fan of character driven literature and don’t want simple plot twists driving my reading experience, but this book needed more.Don’t get me wrong, when it moved it moved along nicely. There were sections that were compelling. The world design is impressive (if sometimes confusing) and multi layered. When the story does pick up it works well but I never really felt pulled to pick this book up. It did end in a manner that left me curious to see what will happen next. I checked the reviews from people I generally trust to have very similar reading experiences and the next book in the series sounds significantly better so I am off to read it.Three stars.
