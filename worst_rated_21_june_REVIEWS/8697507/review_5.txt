This very talented writer has written a Regency romance that features a few of Jane Austen's spellings, adding in a truly nifty magical system. Unfortunately, the magic seems little integrated with the world, having almost no impact on the culture. The comparison with Jane Austen might sell books, but that's also kind of a high bar. This story feels more like a Regency romance, without much of Austenesque irony or complication of character; on the other hand, it is not a retread of Georgette Heyer, which gains major points for me as a reader. (Not that I dislike Heyer or the re-invention of the silver fork sub-genre, I just would like to see authors venture out from under Heyerian influence a tad.)The story takes time to warm up, and there are many period glitches (but I don't think those will be noticed by readers who aren't conversant with period literature), but when it finally gets going, there is a lot of comedy-of-manners identity mixed with magic thrown in to make it roll along. I thought the climactic scene humorously cinematic, though the ending rushes upon the readers a bit, especially considering the sedate start.
