So there were many nice things in this book. The Austin-esque plot was interesting, and the main character and her relationship with her sister was layered, I really think the character was well-drawn and the best thing about the book. Her POV as the "plain" sister was written from a very real place.I guess I just ached for a bit more complexity, with the plot (and romance) and the world-building. There's some VERY interesting magic conceits here, and I just wanted a bigger scope. I think the author could build upon this world for more and more interesting books. This one was a nice basic intro. I think the plot just needed more twists, and there needed to be MORE characters to act as red herrings to make the ending a bit more surprising.I will read another by her though, def.
