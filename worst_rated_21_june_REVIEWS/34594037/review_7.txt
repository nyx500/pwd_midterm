This book didn't work well for me... I wasn't really interested by what was going on. It was very predictable, but I wanted to finish it just in case, you know? In case something incredible would happen and the ending would satisfy me.The story lacked the magic feeling I was looking for. I skipped the parts where the spells were explained, I thought it was too complicated and it didn't mean anything to me.On the positive side, I appreciated reading about Ivy's relationships with her sister and with the other character that I won't name ;) She made me think of Izzy Spellman in the series written by Lisa Lutz, that I really liked.The ending was okay, but I had guessed two important things (I don't think I'm that good a detective... the hints were pretty obvious).In the end, I recommend this book if you liked The Magicians... That's what is written on the cover, and since I didn't like this one either (didn't finish it, in fact), maybe it's a good advice haha!
