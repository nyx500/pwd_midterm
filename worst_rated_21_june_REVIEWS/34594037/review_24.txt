This was a fun mashup of whodunit and Harry Potterâ€“style magic novel. I admit that less than a week after finishing, some elements of the plot are hazy in my memory, but what I definitely remember is the astute insight into people this book showed. I'd read another book by Sarah Gailey. 3.5 stars, rounded up.I won this review copy in a Shelf Awareness giveaway. Thank you to the publisher.
