2.5 starsWhat a bipolar reading experience this was.Initially I was doubtful that a story set in a magic school would interest me but once I started I REALLY enjoyed it…… until I didn’t.It’s such a pity that Ivy turned out to kill my joy with her incessant whining and insecurities about her inability to do magic. The author repeated this fact one too many times for my liking.What I do think was done well is the way the complex relationship between Ivy and her twin sister Tabitha was portrayed.The mystery itself was a little light in the pants and to be honest I think Ivy was not the best of detectives to start with. She basically stumbled upon clues rather than deduct them from solid investigative efforts.This was not a bad read but not on that will leave any lasting impression on me.I was hoping that this would be a great substitute for my beloved Dresden books but alas it was not to be.
