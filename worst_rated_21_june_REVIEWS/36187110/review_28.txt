4.5* re-readWas about to dive in book 2 but had to remind myself of what happened in this one, as you do. Still a great read. Polk is brilliant at creating angst, slowly building, but ever present.---The cover is what attracted me first to this novel, but I ended up absolutely loving its content.Witchmark features a world that feels very similar to our Edwardian times, but for its magic system, ‘technologies’, and resulting social classes and order. Still, with a few strokes, Polk’s setting is beautiful, horrible, and totally captivating. Then there is the plot, at first leisurely, but continually growing in pace, grabbing you in its wake to solve a crime, until the explosive denouement.And yet, after all this, the best part and where I believe the novel shines, is through its narrator and main character. Miles’s voice is so charismatic, I was spellbound after the first page. Here is such a likeable protagonist, one that has gone through so much pain, and still determined to use his power and skill to heal patients, many suffering from what looks like PTSD, and do good. His investigations take him deeper and deeper into danger, as do his relationships with his power-hungry family. And then, to round it all off nicely, we have a soupçon of LGBT romance, so lovely, I defy anyone not to be charmed. Loved it and cannot wait to see what Polk writes next.
