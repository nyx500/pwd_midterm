Historical fantasy with a mystery plot and queer romance? Yes, all of that! Witchmark is my first book by C.L. Polk but it certainly won't be my last. It took me a little while to really get into the story, but I really got hooked. It's an interesting world with a solid mystery plot, AND it's a book set in historical England that tries to reckon with the realities of empire and colonization. There's a plot thread I won't get into because it's spoilery, but it really mirrors some things about the interplay of colonization and British wealth. We'll be discussing this more on my YouTube channel at the end of the month (12/26/21) for Blades & Bodice Rippers Book Club if you're interested!
