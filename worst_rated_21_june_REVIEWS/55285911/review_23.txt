Welp. It’s 2am. That should explain the rating. RTC after my book hangover slumber.————————————-Okay, my slumber is over. Time to review.1. GURL A BUNCH OF MY FAVORITE TROPES ARE IN THIS.I’m a sucker for enemies to lovers. It gets me every time. There are other popular tropes that appear in here that often show up in enemies to lovers books, but I won’t name them because spoilers. Just know they’re there. (Wow, this was so helpful.)2. The slow burn. Ohhhhhhh THE. SLOW. BURN.This is my #1 favorite thing in a book. The entire plot can be absolute garbage, but if the slow burn romance is good, I’ll keep hanging on every word. Thankfully, this book’s plot is NOT garbage and the slow burn isn’t either. 😏😏😏😏 This books uses a lot of subtleties when developing the relationship between the two main characters. Subtle looks, whisper touches, throat clearing, unfinished sentences, etc. It really goes all out on building the tension. My book club and I (lol my book club has two people in it...including me) were big fans of the MC always noticing the Elf King’s destroys hands. 😏3. If you’re reading for bone town and are curious about the spice rating, it will stay PG-13. The good stuff happens, but it’s not going to be super detailed. It won’t do the damn fade to black either (I FEEL SO CHEATED WHEN THAT HAPPENS), so don’t even worry. 4. The dialogue can be cringey at times.This one is weird. MC Luella lives in the human world and then has to go live in the elf world (as you see in the synopsis). The dialogue is legit awful when Luella’s in the human world. It’s stiff and unnatural. It feels like an amateur wrote it. Then, as soon as Luella crosses over into the elf world, the dialogue morphs into writing that’s well-crafted and realistic. I don’t get it. I thought maybe I just thought the dialogue was a bit off in the beginning because I was getting used to the writing, but MC Luella goes back and forth between the two worlds and it was awkward in the human world EVERY SINGLE TIME. I don’t know. Maybe the author didn’t really bother to flesh out the human characters, so there was no way to make them sound less cardboard-ish? It’s bizarre. Maybe it’s just me. (Maybe it’s Maybelline.)5. The plot was fun.I enjoyed going along for the ride on this. It’s not the most complex plot you’ll ever read, so you can probably already guess where it’s going. However, that didn’t bother me one bit. I’m here for the journey of watching the characters grow as they figure out a way to solve their conflicts and I was pleased with where everyone ended up.
