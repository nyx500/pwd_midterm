First compelted book of 2021ðŸ˜˜A Deal with the Elf King was..okay. Unfortunately, it tends to lean towards info-dumping at random times; which was a bit unnecessary/overcomplicated. Also, The world building wasn't the best..I wanted more Cruel Prince Vibes; but was left wanting more. ðŸ™ˆThe romance between our two main characters was nice ( the spicy scenes made it worth the read ðŸ˜³).The story isn't perfect, but I enjoyed reading it. Its definitely flawed in terms of pacing (the book is too long; in my opinion). However, a broody king, and an unsuspecting woman (who doesnt know her own strength) is not a new concept. As far as standalones go this was just okay. (3) ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
