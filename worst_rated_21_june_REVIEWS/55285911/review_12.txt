✅ Gorgeous cover✅ Hades and Persephone retelling✅ Arranged marriage✅ Magic✅🆗 Characters🆗 Plot🆗 Romance❗️❗️Trigger warning: drug useThere are only two reasons why the elves come to our world: war or wives. In either case, they come for death. Because of a magical deal struck between elves and humans thousands of years ago, every 100 years, the elf king comes to Luella’s village to get his human queen. The human queen is the only woman in the village with magical abilities, so it comes as a shock to Luella to discover that she is the next human queen since she never even knew she had magic. The elf king must have a human queen to ensure that spring comes to his land and that life can thrive. Forced to leave her family and her life behind, she makes a promise to herself: she will not rest until she finds a way to end this unbalance in the elf king’s land so she can save his people and then go back home.This story has elements that are clearly inspired by Hades and Persephone since Eldas’ magic is not death exactly, but it’s related to it, while Luella’s is about nature and life, but it also has Beauty and the Beast vibes. The plot and romance are quite straightforward and predictable, but not bad. The thing is, even though the stakes were high, I didn’t really feel it. I didn’t feel the stress or the fact that many people’s lives depend on Luella and Eldas finding an answer. I’m not saying it was telling and not showing exactly, but it lacked a little something to be really compelling. “Some people can never be hidden; they are meant to be seen.”Luella is a nice and selfless character. She is very tenacious and does not just accept her situation, she seeks to have control of her life and she is not afraid to confront Eldas. She is a gifted herbalist and I liked seeing her passion for healing, and she is driven enough to not just remain passive. She wants to be involved and feel useful, and she does not hesitate to take matters into her own hands if she needs to, which I loved. Sadly though, I can’t say exactly why, but she did not grow on me that much. Honestly, I think I liked Hook, Luella’s wolf, more than I liked her. “At your core, you’re a good man, Eldas. But you’re very rough at your edges. You know that.” Her thumb strokes his cheek. Eldas is the new Elf king and he needs to find his Human Queen because only her magic can keep their lands alive. He is dark and mysterious and of course, I liked him because I seem not to be able to resist dark brooding characters. I must admit though that it was disconcerting how he would go from the cold-hearted king to the insecure man that has been sequestered all his life, and back to the pretentious and emotionless ruler in the same chapter. I like that he is multifaceted, but those layers were not really developed so he ended up being kinda bland despite having the potential to be really interesting. “You will respect me!” Eldas shouts. ���Be someone worthy of respecting first!” I slam the door behind meObviously, Luella and Eldas’ relationship is chaotic and loud at first (because they scream at each other), but it does evolve into desire and love. While I appreciate the slow-burn, because I love the arranged marriage trope as long as it’s not insta-love, the evolution of the relationship felt weak at times. Not much of significance happened between Luella and Edlas besides researching and reading, and then Eldas went from being cold to openly carng about her. Sure we get hints that he’s interested and that he’s attracted to her, and I think the author was trying to go for a conflicted character because he likes her but he does not want to get attached to her, but to me, it felt more like a quite-sudden change of character. There was also a lot of drama near the end, and while I LOVE angst, this time it was just a big deal because of miscommunication between them so that annoyed me a little.Overall, it is a good YA book, the world-building, and the concept of having a Human Queen bound to the land is interesting, and the hate-to-love/arranged marriage are two tropes that I really enjoy, but sadly the hate-to-love was not the best one I’ve read. The storyline is basic though and I would have liked to have more political intrigue or action… I feel that there is potential here that the author did not exploit. The ending is sweet and satisfying, but I was expecting more since I enjoyed the Air Awakens series so much and I was ecstatic when I learned that Elise Kova was writing a Hades and Persephone retelling. I would still recommend this book if you are looking for an easy and light read. Fanarts by MerwildFollow me on Instagram 🙂
