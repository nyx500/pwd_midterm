So I was reading this with Josh, but I'm DNFing it for now as we move onto another book. This one just isn't holding my interest. It feels like an amalgamation of Uprooted and the First Year Series, and to be quite honest I didn't enjoy either of those books enough to want to re-read such a similar feeling story so soon. DNF at 30%__________________________Jumping straight into another buddy read with my friend Joshua Gabriel (Forever Bookish Josh). Looking forward to another jaunt into YA/Fantasy. I've read one book by Sarah Beth Durst before and really enjoyed it, so I'm quite looking forward to this!
