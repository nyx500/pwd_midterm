In this world everything has an elemental spirit, each ruled by contradictory impulses, to create and to destroy. For the world to survive there must be a human Queen to rule over the spirits and temper their impulses.In Renthia, a young determined woman trains to become an heir to the current Queen and forms a partnership with a Champion who is in disgrace after questioning the current Queen. Daleina's origin and struggle to become an heir is against the background of a horrible betrayal and a time of strife for the whole country.This is really good. Daleina's not the most powerful of magic-users, but she's clever, resourceful and shows leadership over raw power. The Champion Ven is torn between his love for Queen Fara and his duty to the country and to his young student. Add to that some terrific world-building and a fascinating system of magic and I think this is a terrific start to the series.
