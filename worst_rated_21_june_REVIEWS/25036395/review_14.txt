Another fantasy with a very unique world - guess when you grow up on Tolkien, Eddings, and Brooks you have a certain expectation for a fantasy world and I'm happy when I find a book that's not a traditional fantasy. Sarah's book has a world that is inhabited with spirits that are intent on killing all the humans - the only thing keeping them at bay is the Queen, who has the power to control their murdering impulses. This story is focused on Daleina a young girl who witnesses her tree village be attacked by spirits and all of them except her family are killed. She has the power to control spirits, but it's weak. So she goes to a school to learn how to use this power and to hopefully become a heir. An heir is a woman who has the power to be Queen if the current queen dies.Daleina might not be the most powerful of her class, but she's smart and resourceful and uses what she has to great advantage. I enjoyed this story up until the end. By the end I was about ready to slap Daleina - she kept saying how unworthy she was to become queen, that others were stronger, etc... after she does all this great stuff, you think she would be more confident and self assured! I'm all for those feelings in the beginning and middle of a book, but, by the end she needs to change. Also the ending was very violent! I understand why, but still....
