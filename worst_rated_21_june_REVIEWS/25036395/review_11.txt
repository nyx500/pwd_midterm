I'm a sucker for the magic/training school trope, I'm not going to lie about that. However, because I like it, I want it done well. This book has a nice balance of depth and action with a touch of darkness. Well, it is called The Queen of Blood so a bit of darkness is obviously expected. I liked how the main character was not the strongest in ability or the most naturally talented. She ultimately exceeds because of her strength of character. The idea of a whole culture based in a forest and intimately tied to nature spirits who hate humans is really interesting. I would have liked a bit more detail with the worldbuilding, but maybe more will emerge in forthcoming books.This is a strong start to a new trilogy that I'm excited to continue.
