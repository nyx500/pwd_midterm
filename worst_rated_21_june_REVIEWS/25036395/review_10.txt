4.5 stars rounded upI don't know why I put off reading this so long because it's great! The Queen of Blood is exactly the kind of immersive fantasy adventure I can cozy up with on a cold day AND it has a trope I love-a magic school/training. After surviving the destruction of most of her village by malicious forest spirits, Daleina is determined to do whatever it takes to become Queen and protect the people of Renthia. And in this world, a Queen is highly trained in magic related to controlling spirits because it is her responsibility to protect the entire kingdom. But in secret, the current Queen's control is slipping and she is desperate to keep her throne and her life. Meanwhile Daleina is working her butt off to survive the rigors of this magical academy where everyone else seems to have far more raw talent. I had a really good time with this. The characters were interesting and fairly well drawn, the magic system was cool, the plot moved along at a nice pace, and the writing was something I could just sink into. I think this is a very accessible fantasy novel that will keep a reader's attention. Is it the most ground-breaking, inventive, or memorable book? No. But it is a page-turner and reminded me of why I've loved fantasy for so much of my life.
