DNF around 70 % EDIT: IF YOU THINK A REVIEW OF A DNF-ed BOOK IS A SACRILEGE , THEN KINDLY CLOSE THIS TAB/WINDOW. YOU WILL JUST BE FURIOUS WITH WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ. This is not a bad book. In fact, I love it at first and the story about vicious spirits, a queen who has badass powers but is susceptible to corruption, a disgraced warrior who is not the love interest of the heroine, and sisterhood is  amazing.The problem that I have with this book though is that I can't really connect or feel the characters. Durst writes in a way that is easy to read along but I wasn't able to feel emotions with the cast, especially with Daleina. The characters are as flat as my boobs. No joke.Take for example her time in the academy. I've read a lot about Daleina's friends and classmates and though the girl-power and friendship is great, I didn't really feel their significance because one chapter, they just passed the exam and are first year students and on the next chapter, years passed and they're already a senior or whatever.I get that she wants to cover much of Daleina's life but I find the sudden change of time too fast. I also didn't understand Daleina's feelings for her love interest because their interaction was very limited. It came to the point that I no longer care for the story because my interest in the plot can only hold on to a point. Note: Some people said the ending was really badass. Can anyone just spoil me the ending? I'm not planning on picking up the book anymore.
