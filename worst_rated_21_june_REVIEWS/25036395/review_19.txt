3.5 starsIf you are thinking of checking out this book, you have to approach it with patience. I found this to be very slow at the start, though purposefully so. You could tell that the author was taking her time setting the pieces, laying out the paths that would draw our characters together. It also took me a while to get invested in the characters. Even so, I would say that I love Daleina, I love Bane and I'm just okay with Ven and the healer dude. The whole time, I was upset that Ven wasn't as upset at things as I was. He definitely made some questionable decisions while my girl was out there kicking ass. The healer just need to back the heck up. And maybe that was the point of both their characters, but it left things so that I was only waiting to get through any scene they were in and get back to Daleina. I really love the idea of this world where all of the elements are spirits who are also destructive and hate humans. I mean, come on, that premise. If you read a lot of YA fantasy this whole story might feel a little familiar, but not in a bad way. Sure, some of the chosen one, prickly champion with a heart of gold, mean girl tropes are in this, but the back bone of the story was unique enough that it never felt like a copy paste. I already put a hold for the next two books because there were some really clear pieces that were left open that I can't wait to follow through.
