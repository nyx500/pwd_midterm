Rating ~4.5? Well, this was not at all what I was expecting and you know what? It's fantastic!Our heroine Daelina is no special snowflake. Not in the slightest. She lacks the intrinsic magically ability of many of her contemporaries. However, she is extremely dedicated, hardworking and clever. She is determined to do the right thing. Daelina's desire to be queen is not for the power or glory, but truly out her hope to see to the betterment of the country. Her quest to become stronger stems from her need to protect those she loves. In that way, she reminds me a lot of Mildred's from Mildred's Resistance. And when she believes she may not be the one who can accomplish this she has no issues stepping aside, working from the background to help her fellow candidates shine and succeed. Which only further demonstrates her ability to lead, Daelina is not out for herself. She is team player, the mission comes before anything and everything else. Romance takes a major back seat in this book, with the focus being more on self-discovery, sisterhood, mentorship, and friendship. Rather than have the second perspective be from the PoV of Daelina's love interest, who really only plays a small role, we get the PoV of her mentor Ven. He provides us insight into the past of the current queen and also another look at Daelina and her journey to becoming the strong, independent, confident young woman she was always meant to be. Note this book is not exactly fast-paced and highly action-packed. It requires attention and patience. If I were to equate it to something I would say it is like a nice cup of tea (or wine for my friends who are wine fans lol). It is not meant to be consumed quickly but rather calmly and steadily, so one may enjoy all its small pleasant notes.
