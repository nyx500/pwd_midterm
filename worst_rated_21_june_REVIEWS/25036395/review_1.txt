This book was really cool! The magic system, how it centred around these different spirits and the ability to control and manipulate them, was very unique. The fact that they were based in the elements made them a bit less unique, but I really do enjoy elemental magic so I was still on board. This book kind of crosses genres as it is considered both adult fantasy and young adult fantasy, I think mainly because the protagonist is quite young and she also goes to an academy for magic, which was awesome. Really this book's strength was in the fact that it had quite a few epic fantasy cliches but it was still able to use them originally. Also the protagonist was awesome. She wasn't perfect. Wasn't magically the best at everything, she actually kind of sucked but she showed strength in her perseverance. Side note: that ending broke my damn heart. SO CRUEL. SO BRUTAL. Overall... For fans of: Throne of Glass, Falling Kingdoms, Game of Thrones (basically any brutal high fantasy)Will I continue the series? Maybe! The cover of the next one has a dragon soooo probablyShould you read it? If you're a fan of high fantasy that is just ruthless and complex but interesting magic systems, definitely give this one a go.
