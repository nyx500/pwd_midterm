“Don't trust the fire, for it will burn you.Don't trust the ice, for it will freeze you.Don't trust the water, for it will drown you.Don't trust the air, for it will choke you.Don't trust the earth, for it will bury you.Don't trust the trees, for they will rip you,rend you, tear you, kill you dead.”The Queen of Blood was such a unique story among all the other fantasy books. The setting was largely what made the book so intersting - whole kingdoms (or rather queendoms?), villages, societies living in the trees. And dangerous wood and elemental spirits who are out for blood of all humans yet cannot be killed because the woods would die with them. The magic system was also something a bit different. I liked how the whole story was told to the readers - multiple POVs, with Deleina, the main character, starting out as little girl in a small village and ending with her as a woman. The pacing flowed swiftly and it was just all out enjoyable read! It was also pretty refreshing to read a book not focused on romantic plotline for once. There was actually almost zero romance, the story rather focused on Deleina and her training, girl friendship in the Academy and Deleina being trained by Champion Ven - who was probably one of my favourite characters in the book. I don't know why more people didn't pick up this book, because it's definitely worth the read if you're interested in an adventurous story (mesh up of adult and young adult fantasy) with imaginative setting and captivating storyline. Go pick this book up! It's woth it if you want to read a refreshing story with very unique fantasy world!“Straight-faced, Hamon said, "I'm honored to be working alongside someone with such expert woodland knowledge, superior battle skills, and an impressive beard."Ven stroked his beard. "Indeed you are.”
