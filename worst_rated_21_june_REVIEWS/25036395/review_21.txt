I went into this not having read any reviews or even the flap copy. I didn't need to. Sarah is a dear friend, and I have loved every one of her books. Every one is amazing, and every one is completely different.This was no exception. It was of course amazing, but let's talk about different. Not only was it different from her other books. It was just plain DIFFERENT. I have never seen a magic system quite like this. I know I've never seen a world like this. I don't want to describe it, because I won't do it justice, and I would hate to spoil anything . . . but wow, was this different. And amazing. If you love magic, and stories about strange new worlds, this is for you. If you like to see girls doing badass stuff, this is for you.If you hate magic and don't like female protagonists, this is not for you. Also, we can not be friends.
