As a lover of Greek Mythology, I thought Ariadne was such a compelling story that lives up to all the expectations of Greek tragedy but also delivers a story of hope, optimism and determination as it follows the story and intriguing lives, loves and losses of Ariadne the daughter of King Minos, her sister Phaedra, Theseus a prince of Athens and Dionysus, the god of wine. Ariadne catches the eye of Theseus, who has been brought to Crete as a sacrifice to the beast Minotaur, Ariadne’s brother, who is destined to live out his days in the labyrinth created under the walls of the Palace. Knowing the inescapable penalty and order of death, the two sisters plot Theseus’ escape which puts them perilously in danger not just of their brother but having defied the rules of the gods, the laws of the land and protocol.The plot unfolds with Ariadne choosing the man of her dreams over her family and becomes a condemned exile in Naxos. However, despite her sacrifice Ariadne finds her life dramatically reversed when she awakens to the knowledge that she has been abandoned by Theseus who then marries Phaedra years later. Alone in Nexus, Ariadne learns to live of the land as nature becomes her only friend. The story continues to follow the separate lives of the two sisters until they meet again years later when it is apparent that both women bear the scars of sorrow, love, betrayal and now deep seeded suspicion of each other as the events that shaped them now threatens to pull them apart. When you read Greek Mythology, you know tragedy is just lurking around the corner and this book is no different.A beautifully written story with deeply drawn characters all shaped by the past, with vengeance in their mind and told in a narrative that is unpredictable in its reveal, beautiful in its story telling and vivid in its imagination. I just loved this story.Highly recommended for lovers of Greek Mythology and anyone that fancies something different that is well plotted and expertly written.
