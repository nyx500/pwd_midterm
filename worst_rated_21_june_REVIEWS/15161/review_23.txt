A collection of short stories, set in the same world as Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, the titular story includes even Jonathan Strange himself, though some of the other stories are set at different times in the same world.And I liked it better than JS&Mr.N - though I do like short stories, and the older I get the more I dislike overly long books (exceptions are made, obviously) so that is my bias. But the stories were varied enough, and the writing and particularly the characters interesting enough (the portrayal of women is very very good here, all kinds of women, including the working class ones which would normally be invisible or plot "cannon fodder", I liked very much that Dido was saved even if the poor wife was not. Good on Alessandro Simonelli for risking things to save Dido!. I wonder if she ever wrote more stories about Simonelli...). There is something though, like in JS&Mr.N a certain feel of coy-ness, almost twee-ness about the style which put me off a bit, though here was a lot easier to overlook it. Incidentally, the second story "On Lickerish Hill" is written in very eccentric, character-defining spelling - it is colorful, it says a lot about the character that she would write like that, but it was difficult for me! And there are some ocasional alternate spellings like "shew" which I assume are historical but which I would have done without. (I did mention this feeling of occasional twee-ness ...)
