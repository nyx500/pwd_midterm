This is a perfectly charming set of fairy tales done by the writer of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. It is impeccably written, I'd almost say flawlessly, to produce the appropriate tone for the various stories and their status as fairy tales. One of the tales, On Lickerish Hill (a retelling of Rumpelstilskin) for example, is written in archaic 18th century style English, which is a lovely touch. I would read these to kids, if I had any to read to, my only reservation being that the writing is a bit advanced.My favorite story was far and away "Mr. Simonelli, or the Fairy Widower," though "Tom Brightwind or How the Fairy Bridge Was Built at Thoresby" is a very close second. For fans of Jonathan Strange, he makes an appearance here. As does Mary Queen of Scots and the Duke of Wellington (always a pleasure to see you, sir, but I'm beginning to think Clarke has a bit of an obsession with you). The wonderful illustrations have to be mentioned as well. The hardcover version of the book is gorgeous. And the illustrations inside are reminscient of turn of the century Brothers Grimm books, and some of them even look a little Goya-esque, from his dark period. I thought they were just enchanting. (Appropriately so.)But it is just a collection of fairy tales, however well written. It was a temporary slaking of the thirst for more Susanna Clarke. Not the same as her long form! Write more, Ms. Clarke! Pleeease?
