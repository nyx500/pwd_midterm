I really, really liked this book. I know that it didn't really work for a couple of my Goodreads friends whose opinion I trust, but for me, it was a fabulous start to a series.Sagara has an economical style to her writing, which worked very well with the way the story was layered. World building and character histories are revealed through the current events of the story, which gave it a feeling of happening more in the moment.Based on this first book I am expecting this to be a very strong series overall, and I'm really looking forward to reading the rest of it!
