Disclaimer: This review contains a bunch of random comics and fanart done by me for no reason at all (apart from being a complete geek)Hello, dear goodreaders! Welcome to another random rant about books I love and can't seem to write reviews for because Iamsoconfusedaboutmyfeelings. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~THE HISTORY LESSONThese books are about a city called Elantra. It's a place that has finally achieved peace after centuries of war between the different races. The Big winners, aka. the Dragons (who can shift into human-like people, btw) are at the top of the hierarchy, and the only reason they haven't eaten everyone yet is that the ULTRA Big Boss, aka. The Emperor of Elantra, considers the whole place to be his hoard, in a typical dragon fashion. Nobody wants to go between a dragon and his hoard, so people just shrugged and went on with their lives. To ensure his tiny subjects don't slaughter each other "by accident" (especially the barrani - an elf-like race that is obsessed with killing one another), he came up with laws that would discourage misbehaviour. Then he appointed people from different races to guarantee these laws are followed and that he wouldn't have to eat too many criminals.There are 3 “police” departments : 1. The Hawks - the detectives/investigators. They patrol the streets, investigate crime scenes and solve cases.2. The Swords - the guards. Their main role is to fight when needed, protect the local population, patrol the street along with the Hawks and guard different locations (e.g. palace, library, cast lords, etc.).3. The Wolves - the assassins. The most secretive of the three, they are often tasked with the dirty jobs (e.g. murdering inconvenient people, spying, going undercover in dodgy places and so on).Speaking of dodgy places, the Emperor's rule does not extend everywhere. One of those places are the ""fiefs" and let's just say that people are miserable there and the fief lords don't care.Our main heroine is Kaylin, a Hawk who grew up in one of those fiefs and who has special markings all over her body. Markings that make her extra special and crucial for the survival of her world. She also has quite the attitude, which prevents her from getting a much deserved promotion. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TOP 3 THINGS I LOVED:World-BuildingYes, although the books' main focus is Kaylin and her super-convenient and random magical abilities with which she solves “cases”, the small glimpses we get from the world of Elantra are truly amazing. Each race has its own culture and traditions that sometimes clash with one another, even the barrani that are clearly influenced by the elves from traditional fantasy have their own unique characteristics (mainly the desire to obliterate all their enemies and competition, including family members). As you read you start asking questions such as - Why are there only a few dragons left and why are they all males, why are the aerians (aka. winged people) so secretive and living far away from anyone else, how does the magic work...ops, forget the last one. Its answer - Magic works only to further the plot when logic fails it. Characters I LOVE THEM!Keep it short, Gergana, keep it short...Not saying they're perfect (especially the MC - Kaylin), and I totally despise Severn (I'll explain later), but GOD, if there is one thing that makes me want to keep reading - it's the characters. From the Dragon Emperor (who we meet later on) who has trouble socialising and interacting normally with his citizens, to the barrani children who are so ridiculously cute and dangerous, from Kaylin's Leontine Boss who chews his desk to pieces when he's mad (or when he has to do paperwork), to the human merchants on Elani street who sell fake love potions and occasionally make true predictions of the future. Michelle Sagara is a supreme master at creating highly compelling and colourful characters!Everything Else Yes, yes, I know I'm cheating, it's not like anyone would read this far. XD-Humour - some good jokes in there that made me laugh out loud!-Moments between characters - without a doubt, my favourite part of the series and I wish we had more of those!-Politics – not much, but interracial politics and relationship is one of my top favourite themes! And in a world where you have a super friendly race that everyone hates because they can read your mind (and not judge you, despite you being the devil-incarnate), fiefs where criminals can hide and even work in league with the fief lords, tensions can be quite high. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TOP 3 THINGS I HATED:Repetitiveness - From plot to sentences, you'll find a lot of super annoying repetitions, the writing style alone can make my head hurt some times. Most of the books have the same story and characters rarely change drastically with a few exceptions.Convenience - Don't ask me what happens in the last third of each book. Something to do with Magic and Names that somehow fixes all the problems and plot holes without making any sense (to me). Even the protagonist doesn't know what she's doing after 10+ books.Protagonist, aka. Kaylin is sometimes really annoying - no, it's not because she's an ultra-powerful extra-special snowflake, and no, it's not because she can be really dumb sometimes. She just has to remind EVERYONE in almost EVERY SINGLE BOOK how horrible her childhood was! And she has to rant about it for pages and pages, no one is allowed to suffer in front of Kaylin! Kaylin will tell anyone who dares that, compared to her, they've had it easy. God, I'm so tired of hearing about her stupid sob story, it's so repetitive and condescending...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Top 3+ Missed opportunities (according to me, personal opinion) :-Saving the world? How about investigating? - For a hawk, Kaylin does little to no investigation (of the normal kind) and it really does feel like a missed chance to explore more of the world and its characters. -Villains - usually revealed at the end, 2-dimensional and boring. Always want to destroy the world or parts of it.-Severn - a creepy stalker, I mean Kaylin's partner, who is in love with her, but doesn't want to pressure her into relationship, because he has no freaking personality whatsoever. Instead he just follows her around, being completely invisible to most characters and readers. (Honestly, his name rarely gets mentioned, and when it does, you realise he's been next to Kaylin the whole time and he never contributed to anything, especially conversations). Nevertheless, he IS a bad-ass and manages to keep up with both magicians and immortals despite having no special power of his own. He might not be my favourite character, but I think it’s only because I have yet to understand his purpose.-Magic = no sense!!! (or maybe I'm too stupid to get it.) -The Garden Keeper - you annoy me… A LOT!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~WOW! This is like 10 times shorter than what I originally wrote. Congratulations! You're almost at the end!AMAZING FANART!I won’t hide it – the reason I wanted to check the series out in the first place is one of the most AWESOME FANART of all time, done by  Mathia Arkoniel Just looking at the pictures made me fall in love with the book before I even started them! Make sure to check all her amazing Elantra fanart!Ok, I know I’m supposed to review a book and not fangirl over other people’s art, but… LOOK AT THEM!!!By  Permahiatus  The Severn fanart is begging me to change my opinion of him… By ArrikuSpread the love! XD CoversI like them! They get better with time and I love the new model they've chosen. Not how I picture Kaylin, but I like how my collection looks on my shelf - super colourful!AudiobookHighly recommend if you have good concentration skills (you'll need it, there are quite a few characters with very similar names and even the audiobook narrator can't do a thousand different voices). Speaking of which, Khristine Hvam does an excellent job at ...EVERYTHING! She can do many different voices, add a lot of personality and emotion into them and help you finish the books faster. Really enjoyed her work!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ConclusionIt's difficult to recommend The Elantra Chronicles to everyone. On one hand, I consider it to be one of the most imaginative and enjoyable reads in my life, and yet, it contains ALL the reasons I should hate it. I've given up on other books for less, but somehow, there's something here that really managed to pull me in: whether it's the amazing feeling I get every time I'm transported to one of my favourite fictional worlds, or maybe it's the lovable characters that I can't get enough of, I don't know. Hopefully, this review was somewhat useful for anyone who wouldn't mind investing their time on a book such as The Elantra Chronicles.Good luck, there are 14 books out already! Would I read the sequels Yes, I would never stop! No matter how much I complain!Would I buy hard copies Already have. Would I reread Already have, and it's not one of those series that get better after each reread. You notice more of the flaws...Would I recommend to a friend? - I suggest you try it. I don't disagree with the negative reviews, but I also can't explain why this series is one of my top favourites despite all the ranting and complaining I've done. I have a feeling women would like it better than men, though. Women can tolerate more pointless monologues XD Happy new Year!And for more fanart and art in general please check my Tumblr  or Instagram account :D
