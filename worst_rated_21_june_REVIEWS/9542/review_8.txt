I feel like I would have LOVED this book when I was 13. As a fair warning, not a lot (ie nothing) is explained or described. The author expects you to implicitly understand the layouts of buildings and magic dealings without any explanation. The main character is imperfect, and that is likable, but that is pretty much the only likable aspect of her personality. She is rude, impatient, whiny, and ignorant of everything around her. Every other character treats her with kindness and respect (OK, maybe not EVERYONE, but most) and she is frustratingly stupid back at them over and over again.The world also relies on nonhuman creatures, and expects you to just happily stay in ignorance (like the protagonist) of what their abilities are and what they look like. It wasn't until the END of the book that I figured out that the Aeriens (or however you spell it) weren't gryphons, but... angels? Huh. Okay. So you have cat people, lizard people, elves, and angels. Right. The author barely gives you ANY tidbits about (what should be) FASCINATING races and again, expects you to fill in the blanks or not care.This book really "vaguebooks" the entire story through. "I'M VERY UPSET!!" the book shouts. You say, "oh no! What is wrong?!" and it responds "I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!!"Even the author's EXPLANATIONS of the story don't make sense. They consist of basically saying, "She now understood. She knew what she had to do." Gee, thanks for keeping your reader in the loop. The IDEA of the plot (supernatural murders with nonhuman characters! oh YES!) and the races and the world are interesting. But it's written like terrible fanfic. The author expects you to already know the characters, world and races, so she doesn't bother describing it. Unfortunately, it's not fanfic. It's a published novel. Not planning on pursuing the rest of this YA series.
