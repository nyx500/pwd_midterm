Vampires, werewolves, boarding schools, perfect etiquette flouted in favour of rule breaking, and the fine art of finishing others? Everything about this book is absolute perfection, tbh. The audiobook is amazing as well!I read this for the first time in 2015, I think it was, and I fall in love with it more and more every time I reread it.
