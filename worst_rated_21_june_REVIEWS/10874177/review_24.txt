I have wanted to read this series but a while now and when I received the third book for review, I figured now was as good as a time as ever to start it. Instead of reading it I decided to give audiobooks one more try, after all, why not? I could get so much more read if only I could listen to books throughout the day while also doing other things so I decided this was the place to start and hoped like heck I wouldn't regret it.Can I just tell you that I am so glad I listened to this on audio? It was so much fun and I really enjoyed the narrator. Moira Quirk has a lovely accent and made this read so much more fun than I think it would have been had I read it on my own not to mention I think the accent added a little something extra to the story that made it feel more authentic. This was such a fun combination of humor, historic, and of course the slight paranormal all blended together with a very steampunk goth feel. And truly, this book has some of the best, most strange names, saying and titles I have ever read (or rather listened to) in a story. I am really looking forward to book two.
