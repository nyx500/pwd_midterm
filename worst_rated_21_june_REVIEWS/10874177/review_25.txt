I have one question and one question only: DOES THIS SCHOOL EXIST?!?Because if it does, sign me up. If it doesn't then.. it needs to be built asap!Sophronia learns the finer points of deceit, espionage, and assassination while attending Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality. Now, I'm not all about taking more classes now that I've graduated from college - but I could totally take these kind of classes.I really enjoyed this book. Especially when no one was annoying me. The names were pretty interesting, but then again I did read a book with a character named Kricket. If the weird names freak you out in books.. just google weird names that people have had in the past or have now. You'll get over it pretty quickly.Other than that I didn't really know what steampunk would mean in a book but I didn't hate it. I have no idea when I'm going to read the next book in this series but that is only due to the already growing amount of books I want to read next year.I promise I'll continue this series - I just don't know when.
