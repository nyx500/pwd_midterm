“A heart that’s known love is stronger than one that hasn’t, did you know that?”Mood: currently punching myself in the face for forgetting just how good The Paper Magician actually is. Also, I didn't remember the second part of this book to be so dark and creepy. Damn, I loved every second of it. And, if possible, I love Ceony and Thane (and Jonto and Parsley) and the writing and the setting and the whole magic system even more, now. Can't wait to finally start book 2!__on the tune of barbie girl by aqua:I'm a paper girl, in a paper wooorld.life in paper, see ya layer.a paper pup right there,magicians everywhere. permutation, Folding is creation.Seriously tho(yes, that "layer" up there is an intentional pun)___
