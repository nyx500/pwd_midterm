I give up. I tried I really did. DNF'd at 51%..I just can not make myself continue. I always feel bad when I don't finish a book but this one just has not captured my interest in the least. The premise is good. The story however, just bobbles along and I'm soooooo pooped from reading it that I want to smash small china doll heads into the wall.I don't care for the main characters..don't care for the story..just don't care..STOP judging me!The only part I liked was the paper folding.I received an arc copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.
