This book was sweet and magical 😊Ceony was hoping to apprentice to become a smelter or chef, but Tagis Praff School for the Magically Inclined had something different in mind when they set her up with Mg. Thane. Ceony wasn't happy with this at all as she didn't see any use to being a paper magician. But she was wrong, wrong indeed. Mg. Thane had a paper skeleton as a butler! How freaking cool, but Ceony didn't like it at all. Mg. Thane got on her good side though when he made her a paper dog since she couldn't bring her real one due to his allergies. The dog, Fennel followed her all around and acted as much like a dog as he could 😊Then there is an evil person that comes to the house and hurts Mg. Thane. Ceony must slap together everything she has learned and try to save his heart. < --- Read the book and you will get it! It gets a little crazy train for a bit but it was funMel ❤️
