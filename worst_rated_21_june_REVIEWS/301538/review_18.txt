This is a hard one to review. There is a lot to 'like' here if that is the appropriate word (which it definitely isn't.) Bakker explores character development and morality in a way like no other, and the complexities of his world feel akin to the writing in Malazan. It's a series that is an experience, one that pushes you as a reader and for that, I love this book.
