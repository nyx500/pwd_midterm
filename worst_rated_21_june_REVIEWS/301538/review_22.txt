DNF @25%. This book and series really should have been right in my wheelhouse but I honestly just couldn't bring myself to care. There were too many names, characters, sects, religions to balance with the clunky writing style. I've read and enjoyed Neichze. I recently read Beyond Redemption and it was a 5* book containing a lot of philosophy and religious content. I just felt every page was a slog to get through. Keep in mind I'm a huge Malazan fan and was never lost reading Garden's of the moon. I don' t mind looking up characters and putting work in. I can tell you all about different surges, heralds and the like from Stormlight Archives. This book just didn't do it for me.
