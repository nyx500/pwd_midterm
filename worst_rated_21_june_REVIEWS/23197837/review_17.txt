You know what the worst thing about reading a book that doesn't come out until February 2018?I have to wait at least 2 years for the 2nd book.The Belles is about a society in which a small class of girls control beauty The Belles. I'm not sure if the world in this book is a future version of our world or a fantasy world but I loved it. I don't want to give anything away since it doesn't even come out for 7 months. I will say this though, I think The Belles is going to the book of 2018. Who do I recommend this book to EVERYONE!
