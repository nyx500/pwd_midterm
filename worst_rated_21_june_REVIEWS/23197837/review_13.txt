Okay, I've seen enough. I can't do it anymore. *DNF at 60%*This started off good enough, albeit extremely, painfully SLOW! Omg, so slow. But that wasn't the worst part. If it were better, I would have taken my good old time and turtled my way through it. However, this book wasn't just slow. It was BORING! The main character was incredibly unlikable. She was stiff and uptight and had a horrendous superiority complex. We had to listen to her go on and on about how great she is. She was also just kinda mean to people. Like the way she talked to some people. Ugh. I would HATE her in real life.The obligatory love interest in this book was laughable. In a world where Belles aren't even allowed to date, why even bother with the forced romance? The two had absolutely no chemistry. He would try to be suave and then she would be an ice queen. Her personality sucked so hard. For the first 100 pages we have to suffer through her going on and on about how she's the best, most talented and a shoe-in for the "favorite." That was all for nothing. *face palm* The mystery in this book was weak. The antagonist was a mega-heel super villain. The writing was stiff. The idea of this book is original, as well as the cool teacup lions and bears, hence my giving it 2 stars. However, there were quite a lot of unoriginal elements. For starters, the citizens of Orleans read exactly like those from The Capital in The Hunger Games. Nothing new to see there. The magic of taking the color from a rose and putting it onto someone's face as magic makeup is the exact same magic trick that I read about last month in The Grisha Trilogy. I'm not trying to say that the author downright stole these ideas, but she definitely borrowed them.I fully expected this to be a 5 star read for me. Now I kinda want my money back.
