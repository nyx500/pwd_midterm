Clayton paints a captivatingly vivid portrait of sophisticated wealth and extravagant excess in The Belles. I was drawn into the royal court of Orléans—a world of dainty teacups and lavish desserts, a world which dripped gleaming jewels and spilt vibrant blossoms. But its beauty belied the ugliness cutting insidiously deep, rotting it from the inside.In short, The Belles was a disturbingly fascinating examination of beauty, of how distorted the ideals of physical perfection have become—and the cost of attaining those ideals. And yet, all the shine and shimmer of the story did nothing other than to throw into the relief the dullness of the characters, most particularly the protagonist—and yes, I am referring to that limp, human-shaped piece of cardboard. It's a pity, because the characters are, in my eyes, an irrevocable blemish on the story. I could have loved the novel, but in the end it was, most indubitably, not my cup of tea. 2.0/5
