This fairy-tale-esque fantasy floored me with the fierce female lead. Camille, despite the best grooming/training, cannot just follow an order. That which makes her seem combative for kicks is instead, an inherent need to do the right thing. When pure good encounters absolute evil, the explosion is epic.I noticed many of my Goodreads friends enjoying this book, so when I saw it in the wild, I had to buy a copy. Of course, now that I've read it, the right thing to do is to pass this on to my favorite classroom library. "My" students deserve Ms. Clayton on their shelves.
