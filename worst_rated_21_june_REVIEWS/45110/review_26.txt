With a master craftsman’s fine hand, Robin Hobb begins the Soldier’s Son trilogy in waves of deftly wrought detail, forming a rich and dense world that perfectly awaits, indicating a war of classes and factions and mysterious enemies, for the rise of an epic character to walk the path of destiny. Loaded with political intrigue, suspenseful subterfuge, spiritual experiences and romantic hope to mentally chew on whilst riding through the breadth of the plains or walking through the chilly halls of the Cavalla Academy, The Shaman’s Crossing ambles across enough dramatic elements to make it a genius stand-alone work, let alone the cornerstone of a trilogy, with a wonderfully respectful pacing, allowing each scene, character, and concept, to breathe and dig their unforgettable roots into your imagination as the pages fly by.
