“How different would our perception of reality be if... we discarded the mundane events that cannot coexist with our dreams?”Robin Hobb's Shaman's Crossing was something of a mixed bag for me. I was intrigued by Nevare Burvelle's 'apprenticeship' to his father's enemy. I really liked how that gave us a glimpse into our protagonist's thinking as well as the structure of a different society that his people had been at war against. For me, things slowed down when Nevare attends military school (which unfortunately forms the bulk of the book). While I always felt that this story was well-written and there was solid world-building happening, I wasn't always interested in how the story unfolded. I still think of Hobbs as a wonderful writer and great world-builder, but this one didn't grab me. 3.25 stars “Your future. It awaits only you, to live it and to write it.”
