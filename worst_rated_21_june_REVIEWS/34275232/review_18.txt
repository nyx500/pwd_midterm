This book was so deliciously dark & creepy.Overall I really enjoyed it but it just wasn't a full 5/5 for me.The main character was horribly mean and made me not like the book as much.I did enjoy the actual stories from 'Tales from the Hinterland' a ton though, that I would love to see a full length novel of.I enjoyed the concept of this book but the second half got a little weird and took many different directions and honestly was hard to keep up with.I would recommend this if you like dark, creepy tales with very descriptive writing.4/5Video review to come soon.
