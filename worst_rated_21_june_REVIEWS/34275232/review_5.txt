My mother was raised on fairy tales, but I was raised on highways.Ever since Alice could remember, she's been on the run with her mother from bad luck.I remembered less from my own life than I did from the books I read.Alice's grandmother was the author of The Hazel Wood - a haunting collection of scary fairy tales - that despite Alice's curiosity, her mother forbade even speaking of them. And then one day, Alice's mother disappeared. And the people (creatures?) that took her look startlingly like the same ones Alice knew from her brief glances in stolen copies of her grandmother's book.And all that's left is a cryptic note saying Stay away from the Hazel WoodAlice knows what she must do - travel to the Hinterland and go to the Hazel Wood - but in a world of bloody, brutal fairy tales, the heroine hardly ever makes it back unscathed.She smiled at me, a tender smile that sent fear jackrabbiting through my blood. Ahhhh. This one is STUNNING.Literally I could not put it down.I LOVE the concept of fairy tales coming to life - and for them to be this creepy and disturbing - ooo, it gave me chills.The fairy tale people were so well drawn out in just a few brushstrokes that I was constantly impressed and amazed by them.I also loved the love for literature in this book. She talked like a woman who knew more books than people.I really cannot stop gushing over it.All I really want now is a copy of the original Hinterland Tales. I really, truly cannot stop thinking about it!!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
