*****I received this book for free from a Goodreads giveaway*****2 stars. I was really disappointed with this book. It was my first and probably only ARC I will ever get, and it was a let down. This book started off super strong for me. I flew through the first 80 or so pages, the writing really sucked me in. The beginning was so addicting learning about Alice and her mom Ella, and their past. Then it took an Alice in Wonderland turn, and I stopped enjoying it. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like Alice in Wonderland, but I‚Äôm ok with it staying in its own story. This really felt so similar to the Wonderland world and I was not a fan. The main character Alice was only slightly like-able. What I liked about her most was how much she loved her mom. Other than that, she cussed all the time and was super rude. I can‚Äôt really think of a character I really liked to be honest. Once we were introduced to more characters, I was already to the point of not caring what happened. This book was just not for me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
