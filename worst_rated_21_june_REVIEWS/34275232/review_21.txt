3.75* Alice in Wonderland meets Inkheart in Melissa Albert's dark and twisty modern day fairytale, The Hazel Wood. I have to say that enjoyed the first half more so than the second, as it was less fantasy and more twisted contemporary mystery, which I loved. I also felt the ending was a little rushed and therefore there were parts of the world and plot I couldn't quite get a grasp on. Having said that, I really enjoyed both Alice and Finch as characters and overall found The Hazel Wood to be a fast paced and enjoyable read, with intriguing characters, dark worlds and a unique plot.
