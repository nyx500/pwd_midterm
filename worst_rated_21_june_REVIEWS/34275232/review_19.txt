2/5This was…well, I mean — ugh, this is disappointing to say, but this just wasn’t good ya’ll. And believe me, as someone who was waiting to read this since last year, I’m extremely disappointed right now. I mean, the synopsis sounded great, and I couldn’t wait to get my hands on this. The beautiful cover only made my wait that much worse. And what did I get? A story that was not even average. I swear, once I got past the halfway mark I just wished the novel would end already, and that’s never a good sign.Normally, I’m a sucker for novels that mix modern-day elements with fairytales (like recently I read and loved The Cruel Prince), but this one just didn’t do it for me. And while these moments are rare, where I don’t find anything incredibly intriguing in a “modern fairytale” novel, I can’t even go ahead and label this as “imaginative,” because it wasn’t. The writing made it difficult for me to image anything, and a never found myself “wowed” by anything going on — and come on, it’s so easy to “wow” your audience, especially when you’re mixing in fairytale elements. But, I mean, I’m not saying this wasn’t original — so, at least it had that. The whole idea of a fictional storybook actually being written off of real characters that walk amongst us was pretty cool. So, again. A great idea, but poor execution. Such a shame.Oh yeah, I should probably mention something about Alice or Finch. Speaking of the main character, Alice, I’m now wondering if this was intended to be a spin-off of Alice in Wonderland in some way? I mean, she does end up in a weird world…but, not my accident or anything. Ah, I don’t know. Either way, Alice was an OK character. She had some outbursts that didn’t make sense to me, but I wasn’t invested enough in the story to care too much. Then there’s Finch. I liked him in the beginning, when he seemed like a poor little rich boy — but once the story continued, I grew bored of his character in general. There just wasn’t anything special about him. Overall, I’m super bummed to be rating this so lowly, but what can I say? It just wasn’t my cup of tea.____________________________________Y'all. This sounds positively creepy and amazing. I love eerie fairy tale stories. 😢 2018 needs to come quicker.
