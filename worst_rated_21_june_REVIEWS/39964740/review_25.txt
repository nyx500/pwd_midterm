SPOILERS AHEAD I loved this! And the gays get a happy ending!!!! 2019 is treating us good!!Emmett is a sick young man, but he is handed off by his parents to a binder - a woman who can take traumatic memories and bind them in books to make you forget. She has specifically requested Emmett as her apprentice.Emmett is a conflicted, flawed but wonderful young man with good morals. Lucian is a trapped middle class brat who wants what he canâ€™t have due to his social standing.It is a overlapping book of thematic schemes but they are woven beautifully together in this novel.I loved this book. The plot, the way the plot developed, the well rounded and fleshed out characters, amazing start to the year!
