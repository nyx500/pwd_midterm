4****This book was spellbinding and included an original concept (about books!) that I had never read before; it completely ensnared me into its pages.The tale starts of with Emmett, a farmer from a small house in the country, plagued by nightmares which in turn effect his work. Suddenly one afternoon, he receives a letter, telling him that he must go to be a binder, a job that promotes fear, prejudice and superstition among communities.Emmett goes to be an apprentice as a binder so that one day he can do it himself. In this remote house of his mentor, he will learn to craft beautiful books and will learn to create something, each time, that is unique; a memory. A book binder's responsibility is to help those who want to forget and erase memories. His role is to assist and take these memories and place them in beautiful bindings where the person never has to remember the memory again. However, not all memories are good memories and not everyone wants to forget. This novel really explored the dark side to bookbinding and the manipulation and exploitation used by those who rely on the craft. One day, to Emmett's complete surprise, he finds a book with his name on, curious as to what the pages hold...This book was completely intriguing and compelling. I loved how it used books as a way of holding sacred memories, not imagination, whether these be good or bad memories from a persons past. This book also had a sweet romance and historical fiction thrown in as well. ðŸ’™ Also the cover is gorgeous!
