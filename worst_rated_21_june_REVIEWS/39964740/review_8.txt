I had such high hopes for this book, and I'm left feeling dreadfully disappointed. This book was overhyped, and that I'm positive of. I really couldn't wait to get my hands on this. The plot sounded intriguing and I adored the cover. Lets be honest, it is quite something, and I was kind of lured in by it. This book consists of three parts. The first part was slow, and it really, really dragged. The second was better, as I think it is the only part of the entire book that I liked and was tolerable, and the third part was another tedious drag, and I was itching to get to the end. The concept of binding memories really excited me. I thought Collins was on to something good here, but unfortunately, it turned out very differently than I had expected. There are no likeable characters in this. Everyone is dark, unpleasant and unlikeable to the core. Every three pages or so someone is either feeling nauseous, or is vomiting. It got kind of samey, and caused plenty of eye rolling with me, I'll admit. I was surprised to come across a queer romance in this book, which actually really made this read more bearable. This was the kind of book that I had near enough no desire to pick back up again, once I'd put it down, which is a shame, as forcing your way through a book for the sake of being able to toss it aside is never a good sign. This had potential, but was a disappointment!
