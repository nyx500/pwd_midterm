Some books entice you with their details , their wonderfully alluring premise, and work their way so very well into your imagination, that you are ever so sad to see them end. This was such a book.Emmett Farmer is to become a book binder. This is no wonderful thing for him since this is a profession that is feared, filled with suspicion and ill omens, and one he is loath to consider, and yet here he is apprenticed to Seredith. She is an old binder and although Emmett has been drawn to books, he fears them for they contain something so special and dangerous, memories. Seredith is a master craft person, and she leads Emmett down the path to becoming one who can capture memories and erase them from the bearer's mind.There is evil afoot in the guise of tradesmen, who use this skill and what the books contain to their own wants. While Seredith is a master, teaching Emmett how to weave these stories into beautiful bound books, others are out for their own gratification and Emmett is about to fall into their web. This is a mysterious story, one that brings together love in the case of Emmett and Lucien. It is a story of family, of mystery, and of how our memories erased can change exactly who we are and how we face the future unknowing of the dangers that have been erased. Bridget Collins evokes a world of mystery, one of magic where as the story weaves back and forth through Emmett's life, his family, and of course his interactions with Lucien. We are taken into a place where memory reigns, where a secret relationship can bring ruin, and where books are feared. I recommend this story as a well written, compelling tale that takes the reader on a journey that is filled with danger, magic, characters that are vivid, evil, and loving, and a wonderfully authentic different adventure. It's a journey well worth taking.My review and an author interview can be found here: http://yayareadslotsofbooks.wordpress...
