If there's a bird in the title, the book is almost certainly a banger....“Mercy was a chief’s gift. Inflicting it was their answer.”The crows siphon merciful death. As the lowest caste in society, they are untouched by magic, but also untouched by the sickness raging through the land. People fear the crows and look down upon them, waiting for the day a crow must carry their beloved's plague-ridden body away from the castes susceptible to its harm.This was such an intriguing world and storyline, with a fun main trio consisting of a prince, his bodyguard and a girl training to become a crow chief. The magic system was really easy to follow wherewith each caste being named after a bird, given a separate ‘birthright’ by their corresponding god (save for the Crows, whose god gave them nothing). Its quirks were pretty interesting too, with the crows able to harness any caste’s magic through the possession of their teeth. The plot did seem a little stagnant throughout the middle portion of the book, though I was never ‘bored’ with anything, always intrigued by something else like the characters, the magic or otherwise.Fie’s eventual romance was surprisingly sweet, with a hint of the enemies-to-lovers dynamic sprinkled in to make things more interesting. I couldn't anticipate whether her love interest was going to be the phoenix prince or his earnest bodyguard, but I couldn’t complain either way, since I loved them both (and the author averted a dreaded love triangle!). Tavin was probably my favourite character throughout, though Fie and Jasmir’s individual character development were both done very well!The conclusion was surprisingly satisfying (if a little sad), leaving me with just enough questions that I'm inclined to continue this duology. I didn’t expect a lot from The Merciful Crow, but was pleased to discover another adventurous story with good banter and a loveable main trio.“I don’t get to look away from the throats I have to cut. Why should you?
