While this book had some problems with pacing and I would have loved to see some plot points expanded, I don't care. It was still an enchanting read for me. This is a book not everyone will enjoy. It can be accused of some insta-love and other rushed plot points. BUT I DON'T CARE. You know those books that just hit so many beats for you that you can ignore many flaws? That is this for me. It has an eerie, magical forest with creative fae beasts I haven't seen described in such a way before and you know how I feel about enchanted evil forests! Plus this was the fae as they are supposed to be... mischievous and somewhat wrong. Plus all the raven imagery. Idk.. I had a great time with this but it's not for everyone. Review to come on my channel :)
