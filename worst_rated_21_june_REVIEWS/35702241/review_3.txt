Just wanted to highlight again that I pitch this as my Slytherin romance. My characters have unapologetically questionable morals. Don't expect them to change. It's who they are. And this book is more romance heavy rather than action heavy, like the rest of my books. There's nothing more disappointing than having unfulfilled expectations where an anticipated read is concerned, so I hope this aids in helping readers decide if this is the kind of book for them! If you want to read about bad people getting away with doing bad things while still being likable and maybe falling in love, this might be the book for you! There is still some action and lots of political intrigue. Hope this helps!5/16/19 At last we have a cover! This Slytherin romance is hitting shelves on February 25th. You can read the first chapter here: https://www.tor.com/2019/05/16/cover-...3/7/19 I just finished edits on this new standalone fantasy romance! Cannot wait for you all to read it! We should have a cover soonish...
