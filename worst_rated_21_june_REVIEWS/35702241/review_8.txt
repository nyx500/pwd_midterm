I liked this one a lot! I've read all of Tricia Levenseller's books now and I've come to learn that they are super quick reads, which I always love. I will admit, from the synopsis you kind of expect this to be a bit more high stakes and intense than it is, but it very quickly turns into a romance story but I really didn't mind that. I found it had a good amount of steaminess and tons of angst, and I loved the dynamic between the two characters. I think the book does have a bit of a weaker plot, but like I said, the romance got me. I personally enjoyed the main character although I know some people found her bland. Honestly I was looking for a quick and easy romantic fantasy and that's exactly what I got, so I can't say I'm disappointed at all.
