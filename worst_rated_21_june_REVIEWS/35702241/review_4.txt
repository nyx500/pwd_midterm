a book is worth five stars if i am willing to sacrifice one of my favourite things - sleep. i started this when i got home from work and stayed up until 2am (even though i knew i had to get up early) because i just could not. put. this. down. there are so many qualities and aspects to this which make this story so wonderful:- a female MC who is unapologetically herself. even when her feelings and motives change, she is still true to herself.- a female MC who is ruthless, as well as kind. usually its one or the other in YA, so its refreshing to see a character so complex. - enemies to lovers is one of my favourite tropes and its done really well in this.- the writing has great pacing, easy to devour language, and such an immersive presence overall. - i LOVE that this is a standalone. most YA fantasy stories come in the form of a series and sometimes (aka most of the time) i dont want to commit to multiple books (hence the many series i have yet to finish). i love an author who can take a fantasy world and create a well-developed and resolved standalone story with it. overall, this is such a fun and engaging novel with a lot of great highlights. its definitely turned me on to TL as an author and i want to read more of her stories ASAP!â†  4.5 stars
