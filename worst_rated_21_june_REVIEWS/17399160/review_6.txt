Recycling My First Reviews: A Trip Down Memory Lane, Vol. 1Then ..Snow and ice and frost above, that was ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!I can't believe it took me so long to start reading it! Everything, everything that makes fantasy my favorire genre was dominant in Snow Like Ashes; the unique world Sara Raasch created, with the magic's source, the division of the nations based on the season/weather, the evil, cruel monarch who sought unlimited power without hesitating to meddle with dark forces, the insane plot twists, the battles and, above all, a heroine who desperately wanted to find her place in the world without realizing that the fate of her nation depended on her.“Someday we will be more than words in the dark.” Meira was hope, the only hope of a doomed people, born in a sacked city, her roots cut off, her destiny unsure. The only certainty was that she wanted to matter to Winter, and Sir and Mather and everyone who seemed to think of her as a silly girl. That need made her reckless but she was definitely made of the hero material, I came to like her a lot! And of course, I totally adored Theron! He understood her, he wanted to fit in a world that was designed for him by others without losing his identity, he sook what was right, he was so noble and fair! And to my astonishment, I didn't mind the love triangle, perhaps because it wasn't in the spotlight and it lacked drama (praise the snow above)! I can't wait for Ice Like Fire, next months will be insufferable! A wonderful read, one I am thankful it came into my life!..NowI'm still in love with Theron (I guess some things never change). I have to give you a fair WARNING, though: Do NOT, I repeat DO NOT read the second instalment, Ice Like Fire. It will ruin you, and not in a good way.
