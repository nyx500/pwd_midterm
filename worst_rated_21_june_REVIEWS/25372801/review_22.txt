So after a really promising first half, this book entirely fell apart for me in the second half.The concept was neat, the characters were great, but the plot was just... what. Maybe this is one of those situations where the impressiveness of the writing and the symbolism and all that shit has gone over my head, but I've always been a strong believer in a story standing on its own merits without needing anything on top of it, and in the end the story this book was telling was - while unique - fantastical to the point of absurdity.I have no problem with fantasy, or sci-fi, obviously, since both are my most read genres, but this was just way too off the wall. It also felt very lazy - nothing was really explained, and so literally anything can and did happen.No from me, though I am apparently the dissenting voice on this.
