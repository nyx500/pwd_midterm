I pre-ordered this book because I was excited for it - I have enjoyed Anders' short stories and this one sounded interesting. It defies genre boxing for the most part - there is fantasy, magic, science fiction, apocalypse, and the strange healing power of madrigals. But I like how all the parts fit together, and didn't find it messy or like the author was trying to cram too much in there. I think part of why these elements work is that they aren't the point of the novel. The focus is the friendship of Patricia and Laurence through several periods of their lives, beginning in childhood. Patricia discovers some witchy abilities and Laurence finds an affinity in science and engineering. They are outcasts who can't even comfort one another in the worst years of peer pressure. I liked the characters of these two people and actually grew frustrated when the author would skip major events, which would later just be mentioned in passing. I wanted to be there, to bear witness to those events, to see the pain and growth. I think this is what makes the book four stars instead of five for me - I wanted it to be more connected. I wouldn't have minded a longer read to get the chance to experience more of their stories.Overall, this was an enjoyable read, one I had to take breaks from so I did not read it too quickly.
