Tremendous and highly original fantasy novella, one of a pair starting a series. You know how loads of fantasy is set in a sort of not-Europe-but-really? This is set in a not-Asia, with Chinese, Japanese and Nepalese echoes rather than the standard German, Italian, Ruritanian. Beautifully delineated world, lovely social, political and magical development. And the gender! Kids are all 'they' until they pick a gender, which they can do aged three or sixteen or never. A default they for everyone. What a lovely idea, and makes for some really powerful writing in this book, where one of the twins is assumed to want to follow the family tradition (in this case of becoming female). And so many powerful women, while we're at it. This is a great read, a hugely compelling fantasy story spanning years, with great characters, a lovely understated romance and a wild imagination. The number of "givens" it chucks away (gender, eurocentrism, patriarchy) is just the cherry on top. Properly original. I one clicked the next book.
