Set in a richly imagined world, JY Yang’s first part in their Tensorate series is evocative, bold, and dreamlike. I wanted to be more emotionally wrapped up in the story, though, because I liked so many of the ideas so much, and I love when my head and my heart are equally engaged when I’m reading. But there’s plenty here to keep me wanting to learn more of what happens in the tumultuous Protectorate Yang created.
