This was enjoyable, but felt a bit lackluster to me. I liked the way Akeha and Mokoya’s relationship as siblings was written, especially as they grew further and further apart, but it was a bit difficult to deeply feel all their pain with the time jumps. In general, these jumps created gaps in character/plot development but there was nothing to make up for them, which left me aching for more. The worldbuilding also could have been more extensive, but I did love how gender is treated in this world as a choice rather than something forced on at birth. I’m interested in reading more, especially after feeling strangely touched yet unsatisfied by the ending, and hopefully the next installments won’t have the same issues.:: representation :: East/Southeast Asian-coded non-binary cast, mlm MC:: content warnings :: murder, death, depictions of grief
