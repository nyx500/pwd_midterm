I really enjoyed the writing style, especially descriptions of clothes and the setting were done very nicely (even though some parts were a little cheesy and overdone, but I can deal with that if it's not too excessive).The characters were fine but I think they could've gotten more depth to them and I feel like our protagonist didn't really change much throughout the whole story. Would've loved to see some growth in her (There was a little bit, but also not really u know?).I hope we're going to see more of all the other girls in the sequel, especially Aoki and Channa (ugh I hope that was her name lol) had potential.I'm not so sure what I think about the world building. I like the "Caste System" even though the idea behind it isn't really original. But the descriptions of the Moon Castes were always really nice and I could picture them very well in my head.But we didn't get a lot of information on the world itself other than the typical "oh there was a war and now the population is divided and blablabla".So, I hope to see more development in the sequel for that as well!Now.. the ending? So predictable. And unoriginal. I really wish things would've been done differently. Overall, a decent YA fantasy and I'm really looking forward to the sequel.
