Yes, I'm totally biased. But friends, this really is the book of my heart. As I say in my author note: The story within these pages is a work of fiction, but also a work of love. The world I created in Ikhara has been heavily inspired by my experiences growing up in Malaysia, a country with a dense mix of cultures, and also as a person of mixed ethnicity. As such, it’s a bit of a hybrid—like me. I feel extremely lucky to come from a multicultural home, and it has shaped-and will forever continue to shape-my influences and perspectives.The conception of this story also comes from a personal, deep yearning for more diverse novels, particularly in YA. I believe it’s important for everyone, but especially young people, to see themselves in the stories they consume—to feel acceptance and kinship. To be inspired for their own stories, real and imagined. Even magical worlds have their roots in our own, and I would love to see more books reflecting the rich variety of our individual realities.Set in an Asian-inspired fantasy world where a Demon King takes human girls for concubines, this is the story of the forbidden love between two of the girls and how far they are willing to fight for their freedom - and each other. It is a story about love and friendship, about trauma and despair. It is a story about finding hope in the most hopeless of times. More than anything, it is a story about female oppression and empowerment. The girls in the book each discover their own forms of power and expression in a world that would give them none, and I am so proud of their strength. I cannot wait for you to meet them! <3
