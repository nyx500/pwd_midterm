Final thoughtsSorry, book club, I am not going to get through this. I tried two times, and I just can't. This story has been written better by other, more talented, writers. James Patterson doesn't know what he is talking about. Do yourself a favor read this instead:Original hot takeI am curious, did Natasha Ngan, Tomi Adeyemi, Megan Bennett, Renee Ahdieh go to the same creative writing class? They sound exactly the same, they have the same narrators and the same write-by-numbers plots and worlds. I am sure there are more authors that would fall into this category, but I am only one reader with a very limited patience for the same old. To be fair, Holly Black’s The Cruel Prince can be accused of similar sins, but I found it so much more entertaining though. Is she better at writing conflicts or characters or dialog? I can’t objectively tell.As always, my cranky recs. For concubine/harem scenario - Naondel and A Thousand Nights by E.K. Johnson are better. For rape culture exploration in fantasy setting - Tess of the Road, Damsel.I am planning to come back to this one later, closer to my book club date, to get a better grip on the details of the plot. For now, I have no will to continue. It doesn't look like this novel will dazzle me with its brilliance and originality.
