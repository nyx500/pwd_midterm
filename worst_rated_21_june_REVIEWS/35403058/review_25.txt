“My life is- Air in starving lungs. A hand grabbing mine. A light in the dark. The pebbles beneath me on the frozen bank, and water dripping from my hair, and Jacob saying, “I’ve got you.”  Story ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Cassidy was dead once. Well, nearly. But someone, something saved her. A ghost, named Jacob. Now he’s her best friend and he’s always by her side.When her parents start a new documentary, Cassidy goes on a new adventure to Schottland. Even though I absolutely adore Victoria Schwab, her writing style and the whole ghost story, I had some problems with the whole pacing in this book. In the beginning and in the middle it was pretty slow, it was a little bit like an introduction. And then when we had the last 30 % it was like a freakin roller coaster. There was so much action, emotions and I couldn’t stop reading. So, all in all I’m really happy I’ve read this story and can’t wait to read the next books in this series. Character ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Cassidy, the main character is a really interesting girl with a fascinating talent. She can step through the veil and see ghosts and their death, their story. She’s a really smart, shy and brave girl. She’s curious and wants to hear the story of a ghost before she takes a picture of him. Jacob, her best friend and a ghost is really a little mystery. We don’t know how he died and why, the only thing we know is that he saved Cassidy’s life and is now bond with her. And he’s not only bond, he’s also extremely loyal to her friendship. He really loves her like a best friend and would do anything for her. I’m absolutely in love with Jacob and Cassidy, their like partners in crime you want to team up with and go on a ghost hunt. There was another girl, Lara, with special skills like Cassidy. She was really cool, brave and a lot more mature than Cassidy.World ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️When you die, you go to heaven or hell. Or you’re being trapped in the Veil, the inbetween. Sometimes you move between the worlds, you were dead, at least on the bridge of death, but you were saved. Like Cassidy who was saved by Jacob. He pulled her out of the freezing river. But there are bad ghosts in the Veil, ghost that want what Cassidy and Lara have - a live. Victoria Schwab is a Master of world building and has a fascinating brilliant writing style. When you start to read a book by Victoria Schwab it takes time to get into the story, but when you’re in, when you’re really in, then it’s over. You’ll love Victoria Schwab even more.Relationships ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The most pure and innocent relationship is the one between Jacob and Cassidy. Their friendship is so full of love and loyalty and they have tons of rules for their friendship. They were the cutest. Writing style ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Victoria Schwab you brilliant woman. No one can write like you, no one can create worlds like you,No one can make us feel magic and emotions and so much more. Can’t wait for the next book in this series. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
