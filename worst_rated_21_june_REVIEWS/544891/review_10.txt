“Magic. It was magic, and the magic is called love.”Beastly is a heartwarming, wonderful retelling of Beauty and the Beast. It is a very delightful read, with the chat sessions, the modern-day setting, the wide range of emotions, lots of references to classics, and tons of roses. It is just perfect. I expected a fairy tale retold, and I’m not disappointed.The story deals with important issues, such as inner values over appearance, abandoned children, parent-child relationships, friendship, empathy, patience, and love.BeastNYC: OK. It all started because of a witch. Froggie: thts hw they all strtThe story is told from Kyle’s (a.k.a. Adrian’s) point of view. His character is credibly drawn. Kyle has to reevaluate everything he thought to be right and worth following before: his values and beliefs in life, friendship, love, his relationship with his father, and his attitude toward people as a whole.Lindy appears in the middle of the book. She comes from terrible family circumstances. She is a strong and courageous character, she is smart and independent. Lindy’s character is not fully elaborated, so to understand her thoughts and feelings Lindy’s Diary is highly recommended.It is a slow-paced read, because the setting spans two years. Although I usually don’t, I enjoyed every moment of that in this story. There are no surprises in the plot, but the ‘hows’ are interesting.The book is filled with references to classics, represented in an attractive way. For example, Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë is a meaningful symbol in the book.I liked when Rochester and Jane was separeted he went to the window and called her name: ‘Jane! Jane! Jane!’ And she heard him, and even answered. That’s what love should be like – the person should be part of your soul and you should know what they’re feeling all the time.I loved the movie too, with all the changes compared to the book. And of course, the cast is amazing! :)My favorite quotes.
