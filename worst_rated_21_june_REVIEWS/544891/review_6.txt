Just like with Nerve by Jeanne Ryan, I feel there are too many below average YA books around. This is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. The fact that I already knew the story behind it had nothing to do with how boring this book was. The characters were stereotypical and not worth remembering. The story was boring and predictable. Donâ€™t lose your time with it...
