So. Horribly. Awesome!Didn’t think I could love something so grotesque. But this was such a fabulous story and so fast paced, I flew through it. It had me hooked from start to finish.This wasn’t particularly horrifying for me but was surely morbid, dark and grim. But hey, it’s a book of witches! Save the grisly details, I really enjoyed every part of this book.I loved the characters and totally ship Immanuelle and Ezra. I’m so glad this wasn’t another disappointment of 2020.
