This is basically an unedited, underdeveloped greek mythology smut. This book is if the worst parts of Fifty Shades and Lore Olympus had a baby. It was just terrible in every aspect and I will never understand how this even got published in the first place. Insta-love? Check.Cringey dialogue? Check.Really dry plot? Check. (What plot?)Bad writing? Check.One-dimensional characters? Check.PLSSS I didnâ€™t even expect much from this book. All I wanted was to read some trashy romance story with decent writing, but this was soooo bad Iâ€™m about to cry. I guess Iâ€™m just not the target audience for this one ðŸ˜”âœ‹
