uh oh. someone please admit me into rehab because i am A D D I C T E D. i started this last night, just wanting to read a couple of chapters before bed. and the next thing i knew, it was 2.30am and my eyes were glued to each page. i swear this book is a drug, with each chapter feeling like taking hit. i just couldnt put it down. this is far from perfect. the writing is nothing too special and the world building is a little lacking, but goodness me. this story is exactly what i needed. fellow mood readers will know the feeling, of finally finding a story that hits the right spot and what a relief that is. ps. a small suggestion - put away any expectations before reading this. this is an extremely modern (perhaps unconventional) retelling, so i think readers going into this expecting a more traditional/faithful retelling are most likely going to be disappointed. â†  4.5 stars
