”They say Hades is protective of his realm, and while that is true, it isn’t about power. He cares for his people, protects them, and he takes it personally if anyone is harmed. If you belong to him, he will tear the world apart to save you.” Story 🌟🌟-A Hades and Persephone retelling with a modern touchWhile reading the book I was - really bored- and sad because I love Persephone and Hades story but this isn’t what i expected. - realized that I definitely had too high expectations, sh*tCharacter 🌟🌟”You will worship me,” she said, and rolled her hips against him. His hands dig into her skin, and she moved on, her cheek brushing his as she whispered. “And I won’t even have to order you.” weak charactersFavorite: NoneI didn’t like Persephone. She was always being such a stupid brat. Always demanding or saying stupid things. Ugh, how can you tolerate her? World 🌟🌟🌟cool world building, beautiful descriptions of the Underworld, but still weakDiversity: 0Relationships 🌟”Hmm. I think you are the Goddess of Sexual frustration.”Persephone barked laughter. “I think that’s Aphrodite.”“Did I say sexual frustration? I meant Hades’ sexual frustration.”-forbidden loveThat felt so much like a Shades of Grey mixed with Persephone and Hades story. There was even a “rescue” scene where she was drunk and he saved her from another man. And even though it could’ve been such a great story with amazing tension, I didn’t feel any connection at all. Writing style 🌟🌟🌟Character drivenToo freakin slow pacing It felt rather odd sometimes. Like you wanted it to be a fluent writing but strange parts made you tumble.
