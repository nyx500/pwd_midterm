3.75 Stars! This was an enjoyable novella. I mention this all the time but I am a sucker for fairytale retellings, especially if they are sapphic or gender bending, so I was really looking forward to this book. After a really promising start to my November reads, I’ve gone into a mini slump so this novella was exactly what I needed. I loved how this had a modern feel, yet it was still mixed with magical fairytale-ness. There was also a new spin –that you will really understand if you are a superhero fan- and I loved all the different possibilities that it opened up for new storylines. There is a sequel coming in ’22, that really utilizes this new spin, and I’m even more excited about that book than I was this one.My only slight miss was that I could have used a little more character development. I know that it is hard to fit everything into a novella, and I think Harrow did a good job considering, but I wanted more which I think would have helped me connect more. I did finally feel like I was getting to understand Zinnia, but it happened at the way end of the book. This is another reason why I’m so excited for the sequel because I expect with more time I will connect a lot more. This is a series that I can really see just getting better and better with each book and I can’t wait to read more.
