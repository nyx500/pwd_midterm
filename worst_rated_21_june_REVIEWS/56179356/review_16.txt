I'm afraid nothing really worked for me from the start. The voice, the tone, the story, the language. I'm probably alone in this, but I don't like a lot of cuss words in my books and this one had more than I was comfortable with, especially for a fairy tale. It's a short novella with a good portion of the book filled with shadow-image type illustrations. The illustrations were interesting, but odd at times and didn't typically go with the story at-hand. In fact, several of the illustrations had heads falling off their humans. Many others appear to have really enjoyed this book. But in the end, it wasn't for me.
