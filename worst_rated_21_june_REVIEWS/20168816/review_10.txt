I mean anything Patrick Rothfuss writes automatically get's a 5/5 star haha idcThis short book is about a daily life of Bast.He sits by the lightning tree and makes deals with children lol "What would you like in trade? An answer, a favor, a secret?” - BastIt was so nice hearing from Basts POV! I feel like I got to know him a lot better. Even though I know he can be a bit conniving and sneaky - I trust him more now. Now that I know what he's up to on a daily basis lol I seriously see him as like a jest/joker/free servant to Kvothe.“She’s sweet as cream and broad of beam." - BastMerged review:I mean anything Patrick Rothfuss writes automatically get's a 5/5 star haha idcThis short book is about a daily life of Bast.He sits by the lightning tree and makes deals with children lol "What would you like in trade?
