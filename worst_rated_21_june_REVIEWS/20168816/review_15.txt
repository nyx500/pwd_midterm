1.) The Name of the Wind ★★★★★2.) The Wise Man's Fear ★★★★★2.4) The Lightning Tree ★★★★★2.5) The Slow Regard of Silent Things ★★★★★3.) Doors of Stone n/aThe Lightning Tree is a short story that is set in Patrick Rothfuss' world from The Kingkiller Chronicle. You can find The Lightning Tree and other short stories that are curated by GRRM himself in a bind-up anthology titled Rogues. This story is set in Kvothe's innkeeper days, and surrounds his mysterious friend Bast. For the record, I absolutely adore Bast, so when I found out that there was a short story that starred him, I literally jumped for joy. Also, The Name of the Wind is my favorite book of all time, so I am absolutely biased with this review.I can't even really give a summary without major spoilers, but I loved this story mostly because it has the same magic that made me fall in love with this series to begin with. Seeing Bast help the locals who live around the Waystone Inn warmed my heart to no end. Bast is such a young hearted character, and truly does whatever he wanted, while making people believe what is easier for them to accept. At this point, I'd rate Patrick Rothfuss' napkins five stars, because everything he touches has this amazing magical feel that I can't quite put into words. I just want more from this world, especially with the announcement of the tenth anniversary edition being released this year! I cannot wait to see illustrations, better maps, and to find out if Skarpi really knew Kvothe's name, all that time ago! Also, the Game of Thrones reference to GRRM about killed me. I was giggling like a child, and I wish that I could have seen George's face when he first read Pat's story. It was seriously the perfect touch on an already perfect short story.
