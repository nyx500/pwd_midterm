The prose is nice, but there's not much depth to the characters. The pacing is eandering at best.  It takes entirely too long to get anywehere.I loved the 3 sister witches lore though, this was the highlight of the book for me. Why is Beauty's dad also such a DumbA in all tellings?Solid 3 Stars. It didn't feel connected well with the 1st book.
