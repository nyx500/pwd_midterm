Beauty lives in Rose Cottage with her sisters Lionheart and Jeweltongue and is learning to be happy. Then her father steals a rose from an enchanted castle and must send his youngest daughter to the Beast's lair where she sets about healing his damaged rosebushes and also his heart? 1. I was not prepared for that ending and am honestly kind of side-eyeing McKinley hard for allowing it to end like that??? I was not prepared to have to accept that kind of fetish in my fairy tale retelling. YIKE. I MEAN THE BEAST STAYS A BEAST? WHAT KIND OF MONSTER-FUCKING NONSENSE ARE WE ENCOURAGING HERE?Also: the ending is just RIFE with exposition and not even well-done exposition, just: TEXT. WALLS OF TEXT. MILES OF TEXT. Paragraph on paragraph of context and climax resolution like it's meant to matter when clearly it doesn't because the build-up is a lot of half-started foreshadowing and sloppy plot points that don't actually resolve into anything. NEXT.2. The world-building was rather slight, and left me wanting. 3. I just didn't believe in the romance, which made the ending EVEN HARDER TO DEAL WITH. 4. Overall: it was a fine Beauty-and-the-Beast telling, but it was also kind of dull and lifeless and not one I plan to return to. SORRY NOT SORRY.5. SORRY BUT THAT ENDING THO.
