Oh my god! This was bad! I could have died if I didn't skip like 20 pages! This contained so many unnecessary details!!!! Yeah there were some interesting facts that I enjoyed but most of the book was blah blah blah I hate that I rated 2 stars to a book that belongs to my all time favorite book series But I had to!
