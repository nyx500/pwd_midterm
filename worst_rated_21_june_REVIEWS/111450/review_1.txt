Is there anything more quintessential than Quidditch?This short book written by Kennilworthy Whisp (aka JK Rowling) delves into the history of Quidditch. From the humble beginnings of brooms to the history of the quaffle to the formation of the Quidditch teams - this book has it all.Now, this is definitely not my first time reading this book...but this is my first time really enjoying it.I got the illustrated version as a Christmas present from a dear friend and I absolutely love the lift that the pictures give to this book. The drawing and "newspaper clippings" were so fun to look at and helped me fully immerse myself in this book.All in all, I adored it!!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
