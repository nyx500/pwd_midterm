I loved this graphic novel so much!I am new to magic system and fantasy reads but this one is simple to read and follow.The art work gets better with the subsequent chapters. And woah! Who would have thought one of the characters would share my name?!The chemistry between the characters is strong and all the characters are just too sweet. What I loved the most was the 'nerd' talk right from the beginning. The dialogue bubbles are well put; the art sequences are well maintained. The cover rocks! Those who love manga will know what I mean. The witches, the wolves, the magic and all the reading they did were like dream come true for a reader like me reading about them, seeing people like me doing exactly what I would do if I was in that world. I dig the romance as well. It was subtle yet cute. I love the ending. The action and the 'togetherness'!I cannot wait to see the final copy with all the pages completely colourful!Thanks netgalley for the book!! This is my first ever book I got and I am pretty excited. And rightfully so!
