I never felt so happy with a representative until this book. Mooncakes offered a diverse cast of characters — from a hard of a hearing witch, non-binary werewolf to queer grandmothers. There was no sense that any of the characters were "tokens" or placed for clarity's cause, making this book more substantial. Not to say, the notion of a werewolf and witch love story truly piqued my interest.Be that as it may, even after reading a few graphic novels, I'm not sure if I have yet to be completely equipped with the nature of it even when I've read them in a stretch (I often find it underdeveloped) or Mooncakes just begins its story abruptly. Like how the plot picks up or even the romance— there isn't too much exposition, but only enough to give you a sense of the characters' backstories. I enjoy the magical component of the book, but some of it is still a little puzzling for me to fully comprehend.Nevertheless, this is still one magical and adventurous book! Reading this during spooktober makes me love the book even more as it fits with the vibe. It has wonderful illustrations; delivering the right ambiance on each scene. I could almost feel the crisp, clear fall air and lovely autumn moonlight. Amazing representations and indeed, a heartwarming read.
