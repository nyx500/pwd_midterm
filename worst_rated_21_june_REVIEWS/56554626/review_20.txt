Such a perfect book for the spooky season! I loved reading this, it was very fun and light hearted. The main characters were amazing. Vivi wasnâ€™t a typical annoying bitch and Rhys wasnâ€™t a typical grumpy brooding ass. They were both right and wrong and I love their ages. A breath of fresh air after reading about teenage mcsðŸ˜©Their relationship development was so cute too. Itâ€™s an enemies to lovers and second chances trope. Viviâ€™s cousin was hilarious and when she protected her dear pet and said thatâ€™s her baby, I feltðŸ˜¤The plot was also fast pacing which I like. The ending was cheesy af, yes, but hey it was cute donâ€™t even tell me you wouldnâ€™t want a hea for yourselfðŸ‘ºThere is smut but itâ€™s very subtle. My pussy throbbed the right amount of timeðŸ¤§
