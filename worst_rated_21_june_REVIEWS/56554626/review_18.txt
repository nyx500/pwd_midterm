Being that this book is compared to Hocus Pocus i expected it to to only be similar in the fact that it has witches but i really think it is similar in the aspect of the small town. OMFG this book has the best small town ever. i absolutely adored the witchy things in the book. Itâ€™s a second chance romance so i just knew i would devour this and i did. I truly believe this book got me out of a slump. Gwyn was one of my favorite characters so if the author decides to do a companion novel i would absolutely love if it was about her.
