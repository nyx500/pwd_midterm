The Ex Hex by Erin Sterling is a light and fun paranormal romantic comedy featuring witches Vivienne Jones and Rhys Penhallow. Nine years ago, Rhys left 19 year-old Vivi to go back to Wales. With a broken heart and encouragement from her cousin Gwyn, Vivi mixes vodka, baths, candles, and magic to curse Rhys. She thinks that he will only have a bad hair day or two. But when Rhys returns to Graves Glen, Georgia to recharge the town’s ley lines, things go wrong. Did the curse work after all?Vivi and Rhys are likeable characters with great chemistry, but part of the time, they seem to be more interested in rekindling their romance than fixing what has gone wrong in the town. That makes them seem realistic, but somewhat irresponsible at times. The supporting characters provided conflict or support and had an appropriate amount of depth.The story moved along at a decent pace with some suspense, but not quite as much as I expected. As fall approaches, I wanted to read a story with a Halloween theme and this one fit the bill. Witches, curses, ley lines, a witch college, ghosts, romance, biting toys, and a talking cat make for an enjoyable tale. There are some other important themes that run through the book including family, lies of omission, humor, feeling stable and safe, trust, attraction, and love.Overall, this was a humorous and entertaining read. 3.5 stars rounded to 4 stars for the pure enjoyment and fun that I had reading this book.William Morrow and Custom House – Avon and Erin Sterling provided a complimentary digital ARC of this novel via NetGalley.
