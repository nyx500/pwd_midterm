They barely got to know each other during that time. It was less than 3 months. She never met his family or made plans with him. Then she finds out he is betrothed to some random witch and he's like "Oh, that? yikes". They break up. He leaves the country. She hexes him. Skip forward 9 years. They see each other again and...are still obsessed with each other? But they have no memories to look back on other than having sex. They don't actually know anything about each other. The book is trying to lean on the whole "I remember when you..." and "You used to do this" and what not but I'm not buying that because they knew each other so briefly that they don't actually KNOW each other at all.There isn't any chemistry. The romance falls flat in every way for me. BUT the characters are good. I really enjoyed Rhys. Vivienne was alright. But Gwyn and Elaine are AMAZING! Very Practical Magic vibes. The world, setting, characters, and plot of this book are really good. It just sucks that this is marketed as a romance when the romance was so lack luster. I would read another book set in this town. I would love a book about Gwyn and the mayor. Cause that would be hot.
