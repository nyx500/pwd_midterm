Not only do I not wanna finish this novel. I don't even wanna wanna.I was so looking forward to the experience. I sang the praises of Marlon James' A Brief History of Seven Killings. I refuse to suffer another 400 pages after surviving 300 pages, nearly half a doorstopper ravaged by the most, and most graphic of, gratuitous anal rapes/assaults of men, women, boys and beasts that have ever been rammed into a few hundred pages of literary fiction.Mayhaps, this the way of this fantasy world, but I, a jujube warrior, choose to evade its torture.
