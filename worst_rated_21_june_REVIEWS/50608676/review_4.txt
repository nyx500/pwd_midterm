I surrender.I can handle many things as a reader:The highly stylized, dense prose, when you don't really understand what's going on but just have to immerse yourself in a narrative until it starts making sense. All the raping and gore and general fixation on penis as THE center of everyone's world.Messiness of time lines.James uses every tool in his toolbox of pretentious literary devices. If he wants to dedicate half a page to explaining that Leopard smells like ass, ok, fine, go for it (#highart). I can deal with these things, and I am willing to work hard while reading.But this story needed at least a little bit of grounding in something real, something relatable and human. The last straw for me was the realization that James would never allow his characters to talk to each other in any other way but riddles, faux-deep statements and stories about killings and rapes of children, women and men. What's left to relate to then? How to connect with a story that doesn't give you anything to tether you to it?I canâ€™t do it.
