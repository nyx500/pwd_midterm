i remember being so excited for this when i heard about it. luckily, my library had it, so i decided to check it out today.i read it in one sitting.here i am now, wishing i got another book instead. no review to come. i don’t wanna waste my time writing a pointless review for a pointless book. cause let’s me honest, my review will be pointless because it’ll just me ranting. that’s pointless. it’s me wasting my time writing a review for something i didn’t like. see my pointless point?i got better things to do like um, read better books.
