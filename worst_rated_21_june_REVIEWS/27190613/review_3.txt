4.5 stars I didn't believe all the high ratings, and now here I am with them.A good example of why it's good to try authors again, btw. I'd read a couple of the author's earlier books and found them likable if a bit unmemorable, but there was absolutely no indication that one day she'd write a brutal book--or an uncompromising heroine--like this. Vlad the Impaler re-imagined as an aggressive girl! Fantastic.
