•full review posted now•“On our wedding night," she said, "I will cut out your tongue and swallow it. Then both tongues that spoke our marriage vows will belong to me, and I will be wed only to myself. You will most likely choke to death on your own blood, which will be unfortunate, but I will be both husband and wife and therefore not a widow to be pitied.” I'm in the process of giving my grades up for adoption because I'm unfit to raise them myself. Is there any possibility that I can trade my grades for Radu and Lada?? Because now, I'd be fucking fabulous at raising them. this is all lies; they'd probably end up raising me I know it’s been like 65 years since I’ve finished this book. I have no excuses besides being the world's biggest procrastinator but hey look at me. I deserve an A++ for managing to type up all of this.“We cannot always have what we want, no matter how much we want it.”And I Darken, was as beautiful as the cover. I don't know whether it devoured me or I devoured it but the point is.......😍. It actually made my procrastinator self want to walk around in public and telling every human being, "If you don't read this....are you really living?" . Truthfully, I don't know what part in this book I declared I'm officially in love but all you need to know is that...you will love this. Not only because the synopsis will completely enamor you but the characters will make you want to throw up your soul and give it to them in a silver platter. What's this book about??? PLOT ✔️From beginning to end, you're thrown into a world filled with violence, abuse, dark, finding oneself and somewhat loving??✔️ If you read the synopsis, you won't be let down. ✔️ Usually, I tend to stay away from giving anything about the plot and that's what I shall do. ✔️  honestly i don't even know where to begin like how does one explain this book ?? and actually make sense?? like I don't even understand my own self. ✔️ All I will tell you is that; the plot is very unique and interesting.✔️ it's 5000 times better to go in as clueless as possible with zero expectations✔️ You'd appreciate way way WAY more ✔️ Plus watching the plot unravel and tie together is the best feeling ✔️ I thought I knew what I was signing myself up for✔️ I thought wrong ✔️ 😭CHARACTERS✔️ I know I know✔️ I'm already a mother of 75875845845 fictional characters but like what is two more?? ✔️ that's hardly anything✔️ pfftttt....✔️ listen i dare you to resist Radu and Lada ✔️ P.S:  i'm not saying  you will fail at this  but that's exactly what I'm sayingIf I were to explain the characters then I rather do it by using gifs.  Meet Lada:Meet RaduThat is all. I rest my case. Don't even fight me on this. THE WRITING ✔️ Whoa there buddy✔️ I might as well become the heart emoji because that was all I ever was from beginning to end✔️ i think you need further clarification ✔️ this was me✔️ 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍✔️ In all seriousness, the writing was exquisite and everything was beautifully detailed. I may or may not have drooled but ssh you didn't hear that from me. ✔️ It made picking quotes hard because I simply loved everything.  OTHER THINGS I LOVED  ✔️ Guys, It had a lot of history and I'm a fan of history so basically yes yes yes✔️ I can't forget the representation of different sexualities ✔️ and y'all will be proud of this because I am ✔️ It even includes Islam which still makes me want to scream in joy✔️ EVERYTHING WAS WELL EXECUTED AND I WANT MORE OF THIS ✔️ as in....right now. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE  ✔️ if you're reading this review then you're probably wondering why I gave it 4.5 stars?✔️ well that's easy to explain ✔️ Mehmed✔️ That is all ✔️  I should've wrote this review before finishing Book 2 because now i'm lost as to where my opinion of mehmed changed.  I think y'all already know what i'm going to say next but if you didn't then listen up buddy. If you don't pick this book up sometime in your life then I will come to your house and do this: To put it kindly, you won't regret picking this book up. Give it a chance and let it surprise you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did :) “I cannot afford to lose you, too""You cannot lose something you do not own. Take me with you” ********************pre-review {calls help line} me: i tried to resist it but it gave me that, "i know you want me" look.person: ???me: and i can't me: and i triedme: and i failedme: this title just fucking suits my moodthis makes no sense, just like my entire life but the point is  i want to read it and understand the hype.
