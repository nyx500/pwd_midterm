in the interest of full transparency, this was not what i was expecting. not in the least. and i think its due to the fact this book is labelled as fantasy, which is misleading because there was no fantasy element to this story at all. its straight up historical fiction. this was about two siblings who befriend mehmed (the conquerer) and experience his early years as the sultan of the ottoman empire. but the more i think about it, the more i actually enjoyed this? which surprises me because world history was my worst subject in school! hehe. this was very heavy when it came to court politics and war strategising, which did not interest me at all. where the story really shined for me was the dynamic between the main characters. i really felt for lada and radus relationship as siblings. as someone who isnt close to their brother, i could really empathise with what they were going through. and seeing how mehmeds friendship with each of them grew and changed things was just so hard to watch, but also really touching. i thought the character depth and development was simply phenomenal. im pretty sure i will continue this series for the characters alone. if i wanted to know more about the expansion of the ottoman empire, i would pick up a text book. but these characters made the story completely worth while. <3â†  4 stars
