Elric of FREAKIN’ Melnibone.A supersized but colorless everlasting gobstopper of fantasy have-at-you.If he were a mongoose, he’d be Elrici-tiki-tavi.If he were a professional wrestler (pronounced RASTLER in Memphis) he’d be Elric Flair - Wooooooooooooo!If he were an amateur bowler in California and part time brother Shamus he’d be El Ricerino (and only if we were not into the whole brevity thing.)If he were anything other than Michael Moorcock’s magnificent Man of Melnibone he’d be a calorie deficient, sorcery and drugs addicted, disabled inbred monarch on a cold seat.He is Elric.“Conan! What is best in life?”“To crush enemy, see him driven before you, to hear the lamentation of the vomen, and to never have to mess with that white guy with the bigass black sword.”You’re damn skippy, Conan. Elric sprang forth from the Lovecraftian demented mind of English writer Michael Moorcock. Elric of Melnibone started the ball rolling in 1972 and has been showing fantasy writers how its done ever since.A MUST read for all fantasy readers.
