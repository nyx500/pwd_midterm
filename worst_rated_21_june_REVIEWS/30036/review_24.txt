I picked this for my reading challenge and I was not disappointed, but rather pissed at myself that I was putting it away for so long. I was surprised how fresh it felt, considering that Elric was born somewhere between years 1960 and 1970. Quite a fast paced story, rather short and not overly detailed, it takes us into the decadent and violent land of Melniboné, where sorcerers live side by side with dragons and demons of higher and lower planes. Melnibonéans drown their days in cruel rituals and pointless ceremonies, and spend their nights in narcotic dreams (sort of reminded me of Mayan civilization). They used to rule the world, but now they are slowly becoming extinct. Their rather outsiderish emperor Elric, who's a red eyed albino with weak health and pacifistic ideas, and who's also an avid reader and a powerful sorcerer, is trying to make some positive, in his opinion, change in his kingdom. Of course he's opposed by some and, what usually comes next, betrayed. And killed. Then he's back to life only to face new problems but also adventures, which is fun. For readers of course. At least to some point ("some point" is last chapter, if you read it then you know). Plus there are ancient evil magical swords involved, there are demons and Lords of Chaos, and a damsel in distress, I'm not going to spoil anymore, but what's not to like? I'll just add that Moorcock made an introduction into interesting world, although as I assume in first part we got only a small glimpse at it, with pretty much blank pages if it came to other kingdoms or cultures, but it's not a bad thing. Not to me. This was not perfect (last chapter!!! confusing!!!), this gave me some eye-rolling at moments, but I will proceed with this series, because I'm Officially Hooked.
