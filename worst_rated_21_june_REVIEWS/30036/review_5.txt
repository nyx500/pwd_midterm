It pleases me to return, after many years, to the saga of Elric VIII, Emperor of Melnibone, the doomed albino with the icy demeanor and imperious nature whose constant companion is Stormbringer, a bloodthirsty sword with a consciousness and will all its own. Elric is the sickly descendant of a haughty alien race, a long line of amoral conquerors and wielders of magic. Many of his nobles—including his cousin, the accomplished magician Yrkoon—do not think the young emperor is fit for his high task. He is soon challenged by a pirate fleet from The Young Kingdoms, and the threats that that arise from this challenge soon endanger not only the princess Cymoril but the throne of the Dragon Isle itself.This is an excellent beginning to a first rate series, a series which showed me fantasy could offer alien and uncomfortable beauties, hard pleasures far removed from the comforts of Professor Tolkien’s snug shire.
