You know, I kept seeing Moorcock's Elric stories referred to by authors I enjoyed greatly as being totally inspirational and important to the beginnings of "New Weird" fiction (which is what people who write Urban Fantasy but want to be taken seriously call their work). So I'm going on vacation and I think to myself "This'll be the perfect thing to read on the beach or in transit; fun, surprisingly good, etc etc etc". As it turns out I'm just not seeing it. I know that issue may be that I'm reading the first volume of the stories, and the author just hadn't gotten his pacing or style down, but man so far these are just slightly above average at their best. I'm being very kind in that last sentence. It's like, yeah, he's an albino, woooo, yeah, vampire sword, woooo, yeah, killed his loved ones, wooo. It's not that I'm dulled because other people have done bits and pieces of this kind of thing since they were written, so there's an impact that I'm incapable of getting, it's just that all of this isn't done particularly well. Moorcock tells the reader EVERYTHING, there's not the slightest bit of subtly to the work, and the world creation isn't that vividly painted or novel (race of wing people, fire demons, city whose magic evoked by having towers, sigghghhhhhh). The action set pieces aren't very good either, standard vague swinging of swords and then slightly gross accounts of brain matter splattering. I read Leiber's Fafhrd and Grey Mouser stories and they're wonderful, so it's not the sword and sorcery genre that isn't doing it for me. I dunno, I hate it when I can't see what the fuss is about...Ohhhh also, my version of this book isn't the one in the picture here. It has the dorkiest cover ever (looks like a World of Warcraft elf dipped in bleach), and these absolutly totally mediocre fantasy art illustrations inside. Which also ticked me off because with the slightest bit of effort or creativity you could have done images that elevated the stories.
