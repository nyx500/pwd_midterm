“Man may trust man, Prince Elric, but perhaps we'll never have a truly sane world until men learn to trust mankind. That would mean the death of magic, I think.”Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melniboné  has everything you'd want in high fantasy adventure, a conflicted hero as well as fantastic worlds filled with strange monsters and ancient magics. I flew through this first Elric story. I read lots of Michael Moorcock in junior high and high school (both the Elric series as well as other novels). I always wonder about revisiting books that I think of as part of my youth, whether they will disappoint a much older me; however, I found Elric of Melniboné  very satisfying. I will continue the series and I'm confident I will also continue to enjoy! 4.5 stars“Why should their pain produce such marvelous beauty? he wonders. Or is all beauty created through pain? Is that the secret of great art, both human and Melnibonen?”
