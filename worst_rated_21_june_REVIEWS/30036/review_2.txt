I have always detested Michael Moorcock.As a fantasy reader whose passion for Tolkien’s writing knows no boundaries, I have always had a hard time swallowing the venomous spite and blind arrogance with which he’s been denouncing the champion of my fantasy dreams. Generally speaking, I never felt anything against authors who attempted to step out of Tolkien’s shadow. These separatists, as I enjoy calling them, count shining stars like Mervyn Peake and China Mieville among their ranks, both men I respect immensely. But with Moorcock it’s personal. Whereas Mieville countered his earlier criticism by praising Tolkien to the high heavens, Moorcock remained adamant in his contempt.And yet I always knew I would one day have to read his work. If for no other reason than to get to know my enemy better. But I think part of me also grudgingly admitted (subconsciously) that there has to be a certain level of awesomeness to a fantasy author writing lyrics for Hawkwind and Blue Öyster Cult.So I read Elric of Melnibonë. I confess to hoping to hate it so I could totally ravage it in a scathing review. But it was no surprise that when asked on a late night of reading how the book was, I had to reply “annoyingly good.”For it is good. It has many flaws, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed myself while reading it. And I can hardly wait to read more about the albino emperor of Melnibonë.I will probably never like Moorcock. His books, though…
