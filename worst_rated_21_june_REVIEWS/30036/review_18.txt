"We are victims cousin, of a conspiracy, a game played by gods, demons and sentient swords."Although not a frequent reader of high or epic fantasy, this turned out to be an unexpected surprise. In fact, I will generally drop any book at the first sign of dragons. And while dragons are mentioned on several occasions in Elric of Melniboné, they never actually make an appearance. Apparently, they are too exhausted from a previous battle to be bothered with events here. Suits me just fine.First and foremost the plot of Elric of Melniboné is tightly focused, and the cast of characters limited enough that I could actually recall the names of all (okay, most) of them throughout the story. A very gloomy feel takes hold from the outset, with Elric brooding excessively on his gentle, learned soul being a poor fit as an emperor for the arrogant, harsh people of Melniboné. This evolves into a power struggle with his devious cousin, and a quest for two magical blades which turn out to be sentient and a little on the bloodthirsty side. Ultimately, it's a story of Elric's inner struggles, refusing to be a pawn of the gods and learning to take his fate into his own hands.
