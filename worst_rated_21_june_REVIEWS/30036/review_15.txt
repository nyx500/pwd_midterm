I read this edition years ago. I loved it. I have also reviewed the omnibus volumes that came out recently. While I like some Elric stories better than others I believe "he" (this character, you know "Elric") holds a special place in the annals of fantasy characters. Or maybe I should say tragic fantasy characters. I just noted this review and thought I'd add this to my earlier comments. There was a time when (back in the '70s and '80s) when the Eternal Champion books were a "must read" among fantasy readers/fans. I was reading and looking for fantasy (Sword and Sorcery, Epic Fantasy etc.) as early as the 1960s. We had to search for it back then. Lancer books and few others "discovered" the market and we (fantasy readers) began to find interesting reads. The Amber books by Zelazny, The Eternal Champion books by Moorcock, reprints of Robert E. Howard's works, also reprints of things like Lord Dunsany, Hope Mirrlees and others.Now I'm not a fan of all Moorcock's works, I'm not even a fan of all the books peripherally connected to the Eternal Champion cycle but some of them are really not to be missed by fantasy fans. Elric, Corum, Lord ErekosÃ«, Duke Dorian Hawkmoon and so many more really aren't to be missed.Really. There's a reason why fantasy classics are classics.
