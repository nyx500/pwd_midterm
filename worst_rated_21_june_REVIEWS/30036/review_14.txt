I read this one years ago. When I ran across this audio version I picked it up. Having not read any of the Eternal Champion volumes for a long time it sort of "reminded me" how much I liked many of them.This short book serves as a sort of "intro" to the entire Elric saga and we get a look at much of the character Mr. Moorcock was building for Elric (and I'd forgotten how annoying Elric could be).This (these actually as it applies to the Elric series) is a book I'd recommend for anyone who likes high fantasy or epic fantasy. A good read and this was a well done audio with an intro by Moorcock himself. (By the way, I've been mispronouncing "Melnibone" for years.)
