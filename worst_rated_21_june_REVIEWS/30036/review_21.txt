This book and I . . . disagreed. I tend to dislike fantasy books whose language is flowery, whose characters are coarse and papery, and whose plots are obviously constructions of the authors to be used with appropriately puppet-like characters. But my friend liked this story, so I said I'd read it. :) I don't understand how this stuff got popular. Not at all. I read some of it out loud to a discerning friend of mine, sometimes in disbelief and unable to stop from laughing, and to this day we make fun of some of the phrases. For example, you have this scene where Elric is drowning and a vision "came unbidden to his dying mind." Later, when describing the vision, Elric announced, "It came unbidden to my dying mind." Waiiiiit, did the character read the narration of his near-death? Michael, seriously, your characters can't have read your book! How about when the word "white" was used about fifty times when describing the scary torture artist? Enough already.
