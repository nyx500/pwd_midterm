3.5 starsThis, by Patrick Ness standards, was a disappointment. After reading More Than This though, I really don't know how I expected any of his other books to measure up. By regular standards this book really wasn't that bad. It was exactly what it advertised itself as. A book about the boring kids that are always stuck in the background and their boring lives. It was a boring book about the boring kids but it still managed to be relatable in a way that hurt the 16-year-old girl still living inside of me. When I was 16, I was Mikey. It was almost painful to read about his struggles and for that extremely personal reason, I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't recommend it though. Go read More Than This, that book is a masterpiece. I'd suggest passing on this one though.
