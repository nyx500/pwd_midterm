The Rest of Us Just Live Here is a weird-and-not kind of book. I mean it's weird because it's not about the Chosen Ones (or the indie kids as this novel called them) and it's not weird because it's not about the Chosen Ones. (You got me?)In this world we live in, we would rather read a kick-ass hero/heroine who saves the world than reading a bunch of boring kids who want to graduate high school, no? This is the main concept of this book. So, if you're not into this kind of novel, you will probably not enjoy this one. (But who knows, right?) Me? I really did enjoy and appreciate this novel. Because, I kinda relate to the main characters' feelings. And I can share the same sentiments with them.But seriously, this book is weiiiiiiiird because the main characters (not the indie kids) were living their ordinary lives in a world where there's something strange and extraordinary is happening. Something that include Immortals, Gods, zombie deers, etc. If you think about it, this is cool even you are just the ordinary kids who wants to graduate and not the Chosen Ones who will save the town or the world.As a reader who can't really describe things well, I found myself captivated and fascinated by this book. The original plot, the beautiful writing, the diverse characters, the intriguing setting, the funny dialogues, the mystery, the lessons and insights. All of it. I love them all. But, I do really love how Ness tell this story. The emotion inserted in every word that made my reading experience so so damn good. The Rest of Us Just Live Here seemed ordinary but actually, it is extraordinary.As a conclusion, I think the book's main goal is to impart the insight of living your life to the fullest, in a cliche-or-not way. Which you shouldn't forget that even you aren't a hero that will save the world, you are the hero of your life. You are extraordinary and most importantly, you are loved. By many.
