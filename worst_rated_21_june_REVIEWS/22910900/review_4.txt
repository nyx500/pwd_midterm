This is my first Ness book, and maybe I picked the wrong book.Don't get me wrong. This book wasn't bad bad, not in a way that would make me rant and rage about how awful it is. It just wasn't to my taste. His writing style doesn't connect with me. The book was weird, and, dare I say it before a legion of Ness fans with pitchforks descend upon me, really boring.I just don't get it. Again, not my style. I prefer excitement, a definable plot, well-written emotions and interactions, and this book was a lot of strangeness and too much dialogue and characters I couldn't connect to.I like my books with a purpose, and I suppose the esteemed Patrick Ness' style is just not for me.
