The Rest of Us Just Live HereBy Patrick Ness3.25/5 Stars!All I've heard of Patrick Ness were how wonderful and amazing his books are, so I decided to pick up one of his books and in this case it was 'The Rest of Us Just Live Here'.This book was something I've never experienced with reading before, because instead of following the storyline of the heroes, it follows the normal people. The people who see everything happen and just have to continue their lives despite the demons, vampires and exploding buildings. At the beginning of each chapter there is a brief overview of what happens to these 'heroes', the so-called 'indie kids', and then the story goes on. This group of friends aka the main characters: Mikey (has anexiety), his sister Mel (used to be anorexic), Henna (being controlled by her parents) and Jared (has some kind of godly powers) just want to graduate, and hope that the school will not explode again before they finish their senior year. Very original (credit to that) and fun, although I do not give it five stars, because the idea of the summary was better than the actual book.The whole plot was weirdly interesting, but it had so many clich√©s in it. What I didn't like about this book that the whole store ended with maybe's.
