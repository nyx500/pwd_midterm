“We're just as screwed up and brave and false and loyal and wrong and right as anyone else.”A boy with the simple wish to finish school, and maybe even kiss the girl he's been in love with forever. If it just weren't for all those strange things happening: sudden blue lights in the sky, animals coming back to life and the popular kids always playing heroes.What a refreshing and funny concept for a novel!As always it took me a while to get into it. The first few pages, the many characters and all the tiny side-comments that you don't understand (yet), because you don't know anything about the characters so far.It was weird, beautiful, confusing and so many other things. There's no denying that Patrick Ness is one of the best writers of our time.Find more of my books on Instagram
