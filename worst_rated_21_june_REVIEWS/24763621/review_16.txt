Unfortunately, this book wasn't for me.  Almost half the book in the beginning was wonderful. I just knew I was going to love this story. But after that it just fell flat for me, which makes me angry but what can you do? I love the name of the book, I love the book cover and I love the idea. I wish I could tell you exactly what it was that went wrong for me but I can't. I'm happy to know that more than half my friends on goodreads enjoyed the book, some didn't, but I was hoping after their rave reviews that I would love it too. Uggg, I should never get too excited! Anyway, I hope many of you out there really love the book =)
