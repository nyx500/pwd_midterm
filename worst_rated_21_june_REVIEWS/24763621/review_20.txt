What an interesting concept to retell "Goblin Market" with elements of "Labyrinth" and Beauty & Beast, but what subpar execution! A whiny heroine, a Goblin King that is a Christian (!!! first God-fearing goblin I've found), and unlikable characters all around. I couldn't be more disappointed at the wasted opportunity, and even more so because the plot of this book had Wolfgang vs Nannerl vibes that were thrillingly promising for me (the genius Mozart siblings, in case you don't know, where the boy achieved fame and immortality over his equally talented sister). I visited a travelling exhibition about Nannerl Mozart as a child once, and was fascinated by her story. I even memorised her interminable name at my young age, which I was quite proud of (Just try to say out loud Maria Anna Walburga Ignatia Mozart Reichsfreiin von Berchtold zu Sonnenburg without losing your breath, I dare you!), to the amusement of all adults. But I'd never sought any novels about her or her brother, and I'd not have imagined her story could serve as inspiration for a retelling of one of my favourite fairy tales. How exciting when I realised this was it! Just imagine that: Goblin Market + B&B + Classical Music Female Composer = Glorious Story. Right? It'll have to be a painful nein from me, folks. Liesl here is a prat, Sepperl is a prat, her sister is a prat, her father is a prat, her mother is a prat, everyone is a prat!
