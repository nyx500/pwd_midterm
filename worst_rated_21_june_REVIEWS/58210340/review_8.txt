January Fairyloot. I have the link to the goodies below. My Blog: https://melissa413readsalot.blogspot....I really loved the audio book from the library, but I didn’t love the book. I’m not really sure how I feel, I can’t quite put my finger on it. I don’t like time travel books (with a couple of exceptions) I guess I’ll leave it at a 3 star and unhaul my hardback. Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
