huh. i dont know how to rate this one. my head says 3 stars but my heart is giving it a 4.on one hand, this was an enjoyable reading experience overall. the pacing is fast, the concept is unique and interesting, i actually didnt mind all of the time travel (which is a plot i generally dont like), and i do feel like i want to continue the series. on the other hand, nothing feels like it lives up to its promise/potential. the romance is a big part of the marketing pitch and it ends up being very underdeveloped, the monsters arent at all as monster-y as i expected them to be, and the ending just feels… convenient? im just left feeling there could have been so much more to this.but i did enjoy it! it was a quick and fun read, so im gonna go ahead and round up.↠ 3.5 stars
