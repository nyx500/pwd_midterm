4.25 stars- this took me a while to fully know what to rate because I adored this book. The idea is so fresh and the plot was so well developed in my option, but I couldn’t get over how unsatisfied I was with the ending (which I know, it’s supposed to be BUT STILL). I also felt there were plot points that were never explained that I *needed* answers for!! Joan being an unwilling monster having to team up with a family nemesis to defeat a hero she feels an unbelievable connection with that’s trying to DESTROY her kind? And all of it with a time travel plot line that I can actually get on board with??
