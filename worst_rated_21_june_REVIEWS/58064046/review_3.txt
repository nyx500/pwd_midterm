while schwabs writing will always speak to me, i tend to enjoy the content/plot of her adult books more. thats not to say i didnt like this, i just prefer the complexity and depth of her stories when she writes under VES, instead of VS. because this story is rather simple - everything you need to know is in the synopsis. its a spooky story of ghouls and demons, mysterious family histories, and houses that come with an opposite and a gate in between. im actually surprised this is going to be a spring release as its the perfect autumn read. again, VSs writing is really quite lovely, as expected, but it took me some time to get into the story itself. but i think her authors note does a great job at explaining the reasoning behind this story and what it means to her, so that was nice to read. overall, an eerie story with classic VS charm and style. thanks so much to greenwillow books for the ARC!!â†  3.5 stars
