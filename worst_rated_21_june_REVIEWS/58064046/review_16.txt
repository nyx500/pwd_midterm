This was one of the most CHILL books I've read by VE SCHWAB and I'd love to see her give us more books like it. It was whimsical and dark and filled me with the same enchantment that fairytales do. I loved exploring the idea of homes and how home isn't necessarily tied to any one thing or any one person & you're able to control what you view as that safe space for yourself. I've always been a sucker for VE SCHWAB's books & I will continue to be just that.
