Rather than discuss each of the books in the Tales of Alvin Maker series separately, I'll use this review for all of them. They present an alternate-history account of a nineteenth-century America in which magic is a potent force. Although it might not be evident to non-Mormons, this series is a thinly veiled fictional adaptation of the life of Mormon prophet Joseph Smith (just as his Homecoming Saga is a similarly thinly veiled science-fiction version of the story of the first part of the Book of Mormon). As such, it tends either to enthrall or horrify Mormon readers (just as did Saints, his overtly historical novel about Joseph Smith and polygamy--see my review of Saints). Non-Mormon readers can either have fun looking for the parallels or simply sit back and enjoy the stories for what they are--good stories. They should particularly appeal to those who like to see magic treated intelligently in a series.
