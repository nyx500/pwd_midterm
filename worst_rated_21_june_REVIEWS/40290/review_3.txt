I went into this as an ignoramus, not knowing much about Mormons and the influence that the religious ideology has on Card's work. In fact, my knowledge of the faith largely comes from a South Park episode, which had me in stitches. A lot of the negative reviews refer to Card's faith, but coming in cold, I can honestly say that I loved this novel, and had no idea of any overt religious aims. I'm not necessarily a fan of fate and the fact that Alvin is the seventh son of the seventh son and therefore wields powers, but any fan of fantasy knows that fate often plays a role. How many times does Gandalf speak of it in LOTR? Countless fantasy novels use similar tropes, so it didn't bother me either. What I admired is the wonderful prose, which comes alive in terms of both voice and imagery; along with the courageous exploration of an America with an alternative history. This is a marvelous example of the dynamism of speculative fiction. So, outside of a comical South Park episode, which basically defines Mormonism as 'dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb' Card's beliefs had no influence on my reading of this enjoyable novel.
