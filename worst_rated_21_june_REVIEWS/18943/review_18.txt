Chased from their English abode, their father killed and themselves sought to be next, Iris, Ruth and their mother Margarethe, flee to a Dutch town, hoping to be taken in by their grandfather. Upon arriving, seeking his home, they are ridiculed, shunned and abased. Both the girls are considered ugly. Ruth is a lumbering dimwit. Iris is a scrawny brain. No one wants to help or hire them. They are hungry, desperate and fraught.Happening upon a painter in his studio, they query his work through an open window. He takes note of Iris.. intrigued by her blatant flaws. It is her that gains them access to work and shelter. He paints the unfortunates. He paints the religious scenes of depravity. He paints flowers. It all unifies and they maintain.Set in the early craze for tulips and portraits, the trio winds up in the home of a more fortunate family. It is here that the beautiful, spoiled and sheltered Clara lives. A playmate and soon stepsister to Iris and Ruth while Margarethe works the kitchen.The story unfurls, like a dying tulip, and wilts. Tho there is much kindness, mostly from the haves, there is cruelty from the wants. Greed plays a substantial part in this telling. A love story, a mystery, a historical fiction. All set in With Macguireâ€™s typical use of language, period and tart, which may slow the reading a tad, but it enriches as you go.
