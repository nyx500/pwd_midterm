2.5 stars I didn’t love or hate this book. This book is more of a fantasy romance, with little focus on the fantasy or the plot. The plot is mostly in service to the romance. I didn’t mind that until the end, when the plot, villain, and motivations all felt rushed and characters acted out of character for a few chapters before returning to normal. That was a bit messy for my taste. I don’t feel the need to continue with this series and this was a perfectly good standalone for me. If you’re looking for a f/f romance with some fantasy sprinkled in (oh and were a horse girl/boy/non-binary pal growing up) than this is for you.
