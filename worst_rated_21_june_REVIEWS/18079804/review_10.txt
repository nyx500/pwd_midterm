For me, something like "Half Bad" is very, very rare. I read a lot of fantasy, much of that lot from the contemporary masters of the field (Sanderson, Rothfuss, Williams, Rowling etc.) I have been well immersed in the fantasy genre, and as spoiled as it may sound, have come to expect greatness in the fantasy that I choose to read. I chanced across a copy of the "Half Bad" unedited manuscript at the 2013 BEA, and decided to take a chance. I was sufficiently and unexpectedly blown away. "Half Bad" delivered more than greatness. It delivered a feeling to me that I haven't come across since reading Rothfuss's "The Name of the Wind." I literally could NOT put "Half Bad" down. I'm not sure if it was the unique POV that Green chose to use, the excellent storytelling, the believable dialogue, or a combination of all three, but I fell in with Nathan. Spiritually, emotionally, even physically (I was genuinely squirming in my seat at some points). His journey was my journey. And the fact that this is Green's debut novel makes it all the more impressive. This isn't your average YA urban fantasy centered around witches. I hated even putting that last sentence in here just because this book feel so unique. This is a masterful work of fiction that will grab you, hook, line, and shackles. "Half Bad" has a lot to say about suffering, love, and hope. I'm sure I'll be turning this story and its messages over and over in my mind until the next book in the trilogy comes out.I will most definitely be championing "Half Bad." As soon as it's available, go buy two copies. Because if you're like me, you're going to want one copy to treasure and one copy to give to a discerning friend.
