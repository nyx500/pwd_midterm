“Who are you?”“Gu Yena’s daughter.”“And what does that make you?”“Smart.”“And?”“Beautiful.”“And?”“Strong.”“And loved.”The tears flowed 💔— overall thoughts: 3.25 —*All of my reviews are as spoiler-free as possible unless stated otherwise*Gonna start off by saying that this was enjoyable but I can’t get over the fact that the blurb and the tagline spoils about 75% of the plot of the book and I am bitter about it.But it was generally an enjoyable story. I just think that it would have been stronger and more emotional if it focused on certain aspects a bit more than others. And you know... we weren’t spoiled by the tagline 🤡 (if you don’t know what I’m talking about just don’t read or think about the blurbs too much)“Love and lies do not mix well.”This read more like a contemporary kdrama with fantastical elements rather than an urban fantasy kdrama. However, the pacing felt unbalanced because our MCs spent 70% of the book “getting to know each other” and wondering if they cant trust each other rather than solving the issues.Although I did enjoy the school setting don’t get me wrong. The highschool conflicts were amusing even though it’s not really something I can relate to anymore. I do wish that it was developed more.The mother-daughter and grandma-grandson relationships were the ones I was most intrigued by though. And I so badly wished that it focused on those. If this book focused more on the mother-daughter relationship than the romance it easily would have been a favorite. There was so much potential there and the plot was set up in a way that if it did, I would have been completely destroyed #iykyk I appreciated the representation of the korean culture. From the banana milk and the way characters addressed each other, however, the characters felt cookie cutter. Miyoung’s personality felt inconsistent and I wasn’t sold on the dynamics... I also got really frustrated with the miscommunications towards the end of the book between Miyoung and Jihoon because... IT KEPT HAPPENING. I usually already can’t handle 1 big miscommunication fight but they had like... 3? or 4? maybe more?In conclusion, this book is: lighthearted, doesn’t take itself too seriously, rich in culture and background, and overall a pleasant time. I would go into this with more contemporary expectations than fantasy though :)...and perhaps be ready for drama and the up-down plots akin to kdramas. This book had a lot of potential.PLOT: ★★★★☆WRITING STYLE: ★★☆☆☆WORLD BUILDING: ★★★★☆CHARACTERS: ★★★☆☆THEMES: ★★★★★PACING: ★★★☆☆PAGE TURNER: ★★★★☆—————————POST READ:well I cried 😹😹give me a few minutes to gather my thoughts
