You read the first 200 pages & tell yourself: Cronenberg could be proud. Am I witnessing the biggest twist in literature history? This was the equivalent of Frodo Baggins losing the ring or Hannibal Lecter coming out of the closet! The book begins in foreign, even (gasp!) exciting territory... something so outlandish... in the right hands it just might have worked. Or at least redeemed the three prior mediocre novels. Meyer does neither.This belonging in the long, half-assed written series soon fizzles after the first of two or three total anticlimaxes. Two words describes what follows: Freak Show! And not the cool Tod Browning freaks we are accustomed to ("We Accept You! We Accept You! One of Us!"), or the psycho family in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films. These freaks are here to keep the family values intact, to uphold the freaky status quo. These are the lamest cardboard characters ever! Obviously someone asked to shell out tens of dollars for one of the firstly printed hardcover editions will not be respected: Meyer has fooled everyone... the series is a long and sad disappointment. I can finally put that to rest; the "Twilight" series, at least for me, will now become a gauge to check somebody's true literary intellect! Meyer dedicates this steaming pile to her audience: a buncha teen girls hungry for some literary gum for their developing brains to chew on, with "good taste." What a joke. If I were the band Muse (one I too am a fan of) & Meyer dedicated her book to us, I would seriously fire my managers & take forever to get over the existentialist rut her endorsement would've undoubtedly inspired.Whoa CRAP!
