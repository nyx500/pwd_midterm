I ended up just skimming the rest of this book. Eventually, it just dragged on. I definitely loved the concept of this book, though. I loved the time traveling and how they had to go to different years to search for an object. I also loved the characters. They were very interesting to read about. Overall, I found the plot kind of boring and very slow.
