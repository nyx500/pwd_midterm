pre-read: the worst thing about this book is that it’s not out yet (update: ITS OUT! IM ON MY WAY!)-read: yay!!! magical tea!!3.7 stars.i’ll be honest- the beginning was a bit slow to get into. it all felt like something i’ve read before and maybe mildly enjoyed. but then the subplots start and we move along and the last 30% is good!! there are some really great lines in that 30% that legitimately boosted my overall rating (as good as the last 30% was, though, my rating will be based on the whole 100%). yes, i appreciated the ending. yes, i will be reading the sequel. yes, i’m willing to accept an unedited half-finished word document of book two right now.
