you know that feeling when you finish a book and just have to take a moment to appreciate that it was exactly what you needed to read at that particular moment? that is what im feeling right now. i feel so content. i loved everything about this. the writing was classic ahdieh - stunning and poetic.the characters, especially mariko, were so real. wow. i loved mariko. she was the embodiment of a strong female. i loved the lessons she learned - how to not only accept her place as a woman, but the strength and power she holds because of it. i really enjoyed the plot. i know many people have compared this to mulan, and although there are some similarities, i wouldnt really consider this a retelling. this was its own unique story. i also loved the japanese culture and traditions present in this - it gave the story such a rich feel. everything about this created such a remarkable and magical book. im so happy i waited to read this until the sequel was released, because i am desperate to continue the story!â†  4.5 stars
