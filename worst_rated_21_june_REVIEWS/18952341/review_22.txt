There was so much to like about this book. Good writing, setting inspired by Chinese history with just a pinch of steampunk in mature low fantasy story and all that from author of masterful short story collection Paper menagerie and other stories.Sadly turns out Liu is much better at short stories because while this book has flashes of his brilliance over the course of the book, The Grace of Kings shows some major flaws.Pacing is all over the place and ranges from slow to frantic. Characters change motivation easily (especially side characters) and majority of them are caricatures. Plot drives their motivation, not vice versa. Narrative has many twists and turns that it forgets how to walk a straight line.Despite it's flaws I find it hard to not recommend the book. It's a dish with unique flavor and worth trying for unique blend of tastes even if you don't finish the meal.
