A few disjointed thoughts on the book, which I finished yesterday. I like this book. I like this book a lot. It's a very important one--it's epic fantasy using Ancient China as its foundation. A cross between the Iliad, Three Kingdoms and Lord of the Rings. But it's also very adult and very modern in its handling of power--who gets it, who is worthy to handle it and how you cling to it. And very very cynical and dark in some ways (the violence is always drily factual, but I'd argue that makes it even more horrific)It does some amazing things with narration--and one of these is showing how everyone has a story--this might be the tale of Kuni Garu and Mata Zyndu, but everyone in the cast ends up feeling very, very human and yet larger than life. It's a neat trick. Again, I love the cultural foundations of this--scholars and filial duty! Confucius (well, Kong Fiji)! Kites and fireworks as weapons. I do have one reservation, though, and it's the same issue I have with Three Kingdoms. Because this is a universe where men do the fighting (and women, with notable exceptions, don't), and because this is a story of war, women end up being relegated somewhat to the back burner. The story is very aware of it, and aware of how women try to gain power (and there's subversion going on, more or less subtle), but I still ended up... a bit frustrated? There's awesome women fighters, and some court intrigues in the last third. (and it looks like book 2 is going to be more about the building of peace and rivalries at court, therefore will remedy this)Anyway, that's what I thought--even with reservation included, I think this is a landmark book in many ways, and a book we should be talking about.
