Yup. This was definitely better the second time around.I think the only real flaw in this book in my eyes was the insta-love and insta-sex part with that Hiro dude. It was just so rushed and cringeworthy. But perhaps Jay Kristoff just wanted to highlight that Yukiko was still young and slightly naive, that perhaps later on in the series she grows and learns from it. I dunno. Maybe it didn't bother others nearly as much as it bothered me, but at this point I just have absolutely zero tolerance for insta-love of any kind.But yeah, that's about the only little flaw I can think of. This book was damn near perfect, and I can tell finishing this series is going to be a blast and a half.
