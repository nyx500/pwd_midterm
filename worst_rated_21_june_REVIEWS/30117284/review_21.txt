4.5 Golden stars!wow! I didn't think I would love this story this much! the characters, the thrills, this beautiful world!Splendid!To be honest I didn't even expect it to be a space sci-fi, & it was wonderful!I was looking for a satisfying sensible Space sci-fi & this book mostly met my expectations! I really enjoyed it.---World Building: ★★★★★/5the world, the usual jobs, every responsibilities, the rules & the gifts. everything was great! it took its times to get used to this totally-new world & their new made-up words in measuring times. but it is awesome, if you love sci-fi.-Characters: ★★★★★/5I already said, I loved Akos. he was strong, vulnerable, caring & sensitive... he was one of my sweathearts. at some parts he made me laugh.Cyra wasn't added to my few favourite female characters, but she was actually good & not annoying. she was caring & thoughtful & strong. (that means she wasn't added to my hated female protagonists either.) I liked her & how she acted.also villains' behavior made very much sense & they were well-created, well-writtenCharacters developments: ★★★★★/5-Love life: ★★★★/5I have a ship or maybe two. enough amount of love life that attracts readers to love their relationships (especially a person like me who don't like detailed love relationship descriptions, or I don't care if there isn't many love moments)-Plot: ★★★★(★)/5Everything goes perfectly awesome & at some parts, the things went on as I wished. at some parts it went downhill, but every books has its up (adrenaline) & down (valleys between the events) I clutched the edge of my seat in the end! I loved it.-general idea: ★★★★★/5the general idea behind the story was so unique & I loved it. it was in space, but not all happening in space-ships like some space sci-fi, I reminded without thinking by default. it was a wholly new solar system with advanced technology & societies.at some little parts it reminded me of 'Red queen' & 'Keeper of the universe'. I didn't much enjoy red queen because I didn't like the protagonist. but I loved this one, as I like both. plus in this story is no maid & help-me-what-I-am-supposed-to-wear vibes (I've read enough of that!) it was more like a Dark big castle for a cruel kingdom.-Writing style: ★★★★/5enough amounts of Adrenaline events, love emotions, feelings, fiction, humor & descriptions. :)tho everyone said it had slow pace but I read it in 2 days & for me the plot & the world was so interesting & intriguing, I couldn't put it down, so it was a quick read for me.......that's it.hope it is helpful & you will enjoy reading the book as much as I did.
