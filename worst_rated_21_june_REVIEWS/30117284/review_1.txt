Let's talk about the elephant in the room: Sponsered reviews from booktubers who were paid to give a positive review and are completely ignoring the voices of POC when they bring up some racial issues in this book. Now most of these Booktubers are ones with influence, aka, Jesse, Kat, Christine, Regan, Sasha (let’s not forget Sasha’s scandal either) - And all of them gave the book a 4 star rating and left reviews that were very similar. These reviews didn’t go into any context, just that they enjoyed it and the writing. I also know many were paid to positively review the book because when I was a popular book blogger, I was offered a sponsor myself and for Harper to also allow me to host a giveaway - I declined.My issue with all of this is that they're happy enough to not talk about the issues in the book or any criticism of Veronica Roth because they'd rather get paid instead of being honest to their following. You can't trust these people to provide honest reviews because they only care about money and ensuring the publishers sponsor future videos of theirs and continue to send them ARCs. While I understand that aspect of the booktube industry, I personally strive to always be honest about any and all books I read, including those received as ARCs.
