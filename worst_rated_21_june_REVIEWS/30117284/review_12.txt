01/26/2017Having spent the last hour reading through Review 1, Review 2, Tweets, opinion posts, in addition to the comments threads, there seems to be a whole lot of furore about this book which, I must say, now has me intrigued enough to want to read Carve the Mark. A few reviewers felt the need to disclaim previous reviews, while some bloggers sought to distance themselves from both the author and HarperTeen, the publishers. My understanding is that one, the book has racial undertones, the author's allusion to chronic pain as a source of strength for one of the characters is another problematic issue.Empathy, I understand. What has me concerned is that I haven't read, yet, a review from a person of color. Should any of my friends have a review from a POC, please, feel free to share. Nevertheless, I will set aside the 20+ (laugh/scoff, you know you want to) "currently-reading" books to gladly dive into this one. Will I find it offensive? Perhaps, but what I know you all know is, I'll be 100% real.
