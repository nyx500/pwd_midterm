I loved CJ's Defiance series,so I couldn't wait to get my hands on the book. I adored Lorelai and Kol. They're awesome separate, but amazing together and their predicament makes things interesting. Never fear, there is still some delicious banter and sweet swoons. The cast of characters is relatively small and it was fantastic to have a fantasy story without eleventy billion names that all look the same. Each character is important and I can't even talk about the awesomeness that is Lorelai's bird, Sasha, or brother, Leo. The plot was intriguing and the ending is perfect. For the entire book I was in that crazy space of wanting to hurry and wanting to savor. I can't wait to see if there's more. **Huge thanks to Balzer + Bray and Edelweiss for providing the arc in exchange for an honest review**
