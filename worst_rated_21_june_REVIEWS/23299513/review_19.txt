Plot ~ Concept: ★★★★☆ ~ Execution: ★☆☆☆☆½Pacing: ★★☆☆☆Writing style: ★★☆☆☆Characters: ★★☆☆☆World: ★★☆☆☆½Enjoyment: ★☆☆☆☆½Cover: ★★☆☆☆Pros: ○ The book started out strong, and there were certain elements that presented an intriguing take on the original tale of Snow White.○ The Prologue was also intriguing.○ Leo was a typical goofy, annoying younger sibling and I adored his banter with Lorelei. Too bad he was killed within the first 100 pages ○The fact that dragons and ogres exist in this world. (Note: I’m not saying that it was done well, simply that it’s there.Annnd that’s all I have.Cons:○ All of the characters were cookie-cutter characters, Mary Sues and Gary Stus.○ The dialogue was so cliché and made me cringe.○ The insta-love, the romance, the cringing...that’s all. I doubt I have to elaborate further. ○ I wish that Irania’s motivations and obsession with a certain element were delved into further and were more deep-rooted.○ The author tried to make Irina, the antagonist, appear vulnerable and multi-dimensional, but all she came across as was underwhelming, and I failed to sympathise with her. ○ The plot DRAGGED until the ending, and even the ending of the book was convenient and left me feeling underwhelmed. ○ The fact that LEO —the only good thing about the book— WAS KILLED. I don’t mind character deaths, but his death felt like it was a cheap way to propel the protagonist forward. Overall rating: ★☆☆☆☆½————————————I deserve coffee for completing this book. Because it gave me a headache. Goodbye failed caffeine detox, you won’t be missed.
