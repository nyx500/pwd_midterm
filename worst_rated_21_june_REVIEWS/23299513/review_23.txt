Official comments: Magic, dragons, and royalty in hiding: THE SHADOW QUEEN hits all the right notes of an incredible epic fantasy. With charming characters, smart prose, and seamless worldbuilding, C.J. Redwine's fantastic retelling of Snow White is sure to cast a spell of wonder. Unofficial comments: The DEFIANCE Trilogy is one of my all time favorites, and THE SHADOW QUEEN is right up there with it. The story is beautiful. The characters are delightful (or scary, as the case may be). And the worldbuilding is spot on. This book is so CJ that it seemed like my friend was telling me the story over a big plate of cookies and lemon bars. Highly recommended.
