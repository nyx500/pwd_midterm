4* for the novella + 1* for Benedict Cumberbatch narration ( I adore his voice). A family (mother, father and sister) are forced to become responsible and find jobs when the son, the sole provider of the family, has a sort of a disease and cannot work anymore. As he becomes useless he is marginalized and despised. I almost forgot, the disease is that the son wakes up in the morning as a cockroach. Methamorphosis is considered one of the best books ever written which is quite remarkable considering its size. To succeed to have such an impact in a few pages is an accomplishment. At a first glance it is the story of Gregor Samsa, who wakes up transformed as a vermin and becomes treated like one by the family. As with great literature, and with Kafka in particular, there is more than meets the eye. Some of the themes that come to my mind (and some that I read in other reviews) are:-	What happens when a person is no longer sociable acceptable and it becomes marginalized -	The novel can be seen as a critic of discrimination or-	Kafka’s own existential suffering and his alienation from the world ( I think some reading about Kafka’s life is needed to better understand his work). -	A fable of Jews’ conditionFor a better and more in depth analysis of the novella please check Vladimir Nabokov’s contribution: http://www.kafka.org/index.php?id=191...
