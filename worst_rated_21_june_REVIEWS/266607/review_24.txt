Okay, I was so surprised when I picked this one up and found out that it wasn't about Kaye. I honestly didn't even read the synopsis because I wanted to go into it surprised but still, I assumed it would follow the characters from Tithe.Book two was just as weird as the first one (possible weirder) with a lot of questioning situations to be honest. In this one we follow Val and all the strange events that she goes through. Another girl who meets the Faerie realm and its inhabitants. Ravus was also a complete sweetheart! I mean I never thought I'd say this about a troll but it is what it is. This whole book was a whirlwind of the strangest kind and even though I read it in one sitting I didn't love it as much as I did the first one. The characters were at a level of annoying. The only really liked Val (even though she did make some really dumb choices at times) and of course Ravus because he was different.
