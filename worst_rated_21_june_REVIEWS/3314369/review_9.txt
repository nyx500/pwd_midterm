This book was brutal, even by grimdark standards. It's not so much the violence (which exists without being gratuitous) but the situations in which the characters find themselves. Stephen Crane would've been proud. There is an existentialist dread throughout, and the characters are lifelike and likable even when they are not exactly paragons of virtue. They are rounded and make decisions that don't reflect a stereotype, much like real people. Some of their decisions border on evil yet they retain their likability.The protagonist is gay, which is something I don't recall seeing in the fantasy genre. He is not exactly monogamous (nor is anyone I can think of in this story) which I read in previous reviews some readers saw as pornographic. I wouldn't go so far as to say that, but there definitely is a fair amount of sex in the story. I don't see it as excessive, however. In order to convey the grit and atmosphere of the world the author has designed it's necessary to include details that might otherwise be seen as over the top. This includes the sex and violence.The story kept me going throughout without pause. This is one of the most well-designed fantasy settings I have read. I know Morgan did some successful work with his Altered Carbon series which I have not read. His experience in world design shows.Initially, it felt like a hard-boiled detective novel with the protagonist getting a rescue the girl assignment, but eventually plot threads blend and what seemed like the main storyline becomes a byline (which is not in any way a spoiler btw).Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this read and am looking forward to the next book.Four stars.
