“Funny how when we start to tell a secret, we can’t stop. Something falls open in us, and the sheer momentum of letting go pushes us on.”A dark and magical tale, that reminded me of The Woman in Black.I'm a huge fan of Victoria Schwab because her writing and her stories are amazing and unique. An expert in world-building, character-depth and originality, all set in a thrilling and mysterious mood like no other.The Near Witch is one of the author's earlier works. While it'll never be as good as Vicious or A Darker Shade of Magic (since they're both mindblowing), reading it was just as captivating as any other Schwab book.Find more of my books on Instagram
