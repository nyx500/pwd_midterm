This is so underrated I want to punch someone.The Near Witch was Victoria Schwab's debut novel, yes, the same author of Shades of Magic series. It's actually one of the first yafs I've ever read and loved. I had the pleasure of reading this right after it was released 5 years ago and I still read it from time to time. I read it whenever I feel a slump looming in the background. I reach for it whenever I want something ya but not romance-centered. It's like my go-to book to be honest. It reads like a fairytale. The writing was beautiful and lyrical and captivating. The vivid descriptions sucked me right in with the first few pages. The story was eerie and had a creep factor. It was eerily and creepily enough to haunt you right after you put it down. I cannot talk about this book without going into full fangirl mode. I can't believe how overlooked this is when it's positively one of the best books ever. Sigh. If you loved Vicious and/or A Darker Shade of Magic but haven't read this one yet, why the f not? You have no idea what you're missing out. This one here is timeless and breathtaking, an infallible classic.
