I rather enjoyed this debut of one of my favourite authors. I knew, going into it, that it wouldn’t be on Vicious’ level, or A Darker Shade of Magic’s, but regardless, it was also quite special on its own. It was atmospheric, very spooky and chilling...with ghosts and witches...with unwelcoming villagers and lost children...with unsolved mysteries and unjust witch-hunts. And I enjoyed every moment of it. I’m definitely glad I gave this book a chance, considering that it’s always risky...reading a debut, when you love an author’s later works. It’s also wonderful to see how far they’ve come and evolved over the years, as they’ve honed their craft to perfection. Lexi was headstrong and protective of her younger sister, Wren. Cole was simply precious and a walking mystery himself. They both worked very well as protagonists, even though their relationship was a tad too instalovey for my tastes. I’d recommend this to anyone in the mood for a chilling and magical tale. Beware the Near Witch!
