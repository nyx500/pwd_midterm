Cover Reveal: Good old Asian vibesBut re-reading the synopsis and seeing, "she must spurn the young man who loves her..." Me: Wait, does she love him too? OMG am I gonna be heartbroken again by another tragic love story!? Ugh my heart is not ready!!! ---It just makes me so happy when I see Asian protagonists because I saw so few of them growing up. Now with books getting a little more and more diverse, I get to see them more often, and it is just so nice.
