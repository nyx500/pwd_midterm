3.5 starsYour average 2010 YA but with some modern perks. Holly Black was ahead of the game even back then ðŸ¤§This book was surprisingly dark and twisty. I really enjoyed following Cassel around in his search for clues. I didnâ€™t find the world building mindblowing, but it was fun to read about some kind of parallel reality in which everyone wears gloves to protect themselves and others from magic.My main issue with this book is that for a good 60% not a lot happens. I was almost halfway through and I was considering dnfing it, but Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t. What made me keep going was Cassel. Heâ€™s a lovely main character, and if I had read this around five or six years ago, I would have had a crush on him lol! The cool thing is that heâ€™s funny and sometimes very naive, but he also just cons people like that and he doesnâ€™t care a single bit. Man, I love his duality.This was a fun mystery and honestly, compared to other YA books published in those years, it stands out. The plot isnâ€™t a given right away, and the book definitely uses tropes, but not blatantly. For example, there is something that resembles a love triangle but itâ€™s not the usual one because itâ€™s layered. The chosen one narrative is there too, but the main character relies on his cleverness instead. So, I quite enjoyed this book, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ever going to read book 2. I shouldâ€™ve read this when it first came out, Iâ€™m sure it would have been one of my favorite series.
