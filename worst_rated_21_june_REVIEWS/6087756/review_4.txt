I don't even know why I liked this so much. I kind of guessed most of the twists, but it still so damn delicious that I immediately downloaded BOTH of the next two audiobooks as soon as I finished this one.And it was read by Jesse Eisenberg who did a really good job of it. I was sort of surprised that I liked his reading of this thing, but I did.
