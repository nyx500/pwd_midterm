When I started reading The Starless Sea, I was blown away. I read through stories of pirates and girls in forests, of key holders and sword sellers, Fate, Time, the Moon, and some dude named Zach. The stories were intoxicating, like I was floating around in some hypnotic, dream-like daze, breathing in all of these beautiful short stories. They were beautifully written, imaginative little pieces of art, all smushed together and delicately held in place. But somewhere in my drunken haze, the magic started to slowly melt away. It felt kind of like when the cops show up to your college party or when you visit Chuck E. Cheese as an adult. The fun and games just kind of disappeared all of a sudden, and it ultimately became more of a chore to finish rather than a magic carpet ride, or a trip to a Wonderland, or... whatever. In my humble opinion, the overarching storyline of Zachary Evans Whoever that anchors this whole thing just was not very good compared to the short stories surrounding it. I loved the short stories and watching them suddenly start to connect or weave into the larger one, but when I started losing interest in Zachary’s story, I also started caring less about the other stories, too. Everything just started to unravel for me. There honestly wasn’t much of a plot underneath all the layers of stories, and the plot that was there became less and less interesting to me over time. There was a lot of time dedicated to painting a scene. There were beautiful descriptions of places, but not enough time dedicated to the characters. I just didn’t feel invested in the story as a whole, and enjoyed the shorter fantasy tales much more. Maybe if this was a book of fairy tales it would have worked better for me. The writing is excellent, but the overall story just didn’t connect for me.
