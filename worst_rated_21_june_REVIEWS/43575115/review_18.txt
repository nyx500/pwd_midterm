Am I confused as heck? Yes. But was this book the most incredibly magical, moving, imaginative and absolutely immersive gem Iâ€™ve read in a long time? Also yes. I enjoyed this so much more than The Night Circus! "We are all stardust and stories." Ok, where do I begin? I can honestly say I've never read anything like this book before. Zachary Ezra Rawlings finds a book in the library that isn't catalogued and becomes curious. Once he begins reading 'Sweet Sorrows' he discovers a world beyond his wildest dreams - and the weirdest part? One of the chapters in the book is a part of Zachary's childhood - he is reading about himself.  "Do not be afraid; our fate cannot be taken from us; it is a gift." Pretty soon Zachary becomes obsessed with this book and will do anything to discover more about how it was written, and what it means that he is in the story. I won't say too much because I think it's best to go in blind and be swept away with the magic of this book. "Because I haven't figured out the puzzle yet even though I don't know what the puzzle is. Because I feel more alive down here than I ever did up there." The world of the Starless Sea is filled with wonder and imagination, don't expect to understand everything because honestly some of it just went straight over my head. But what really tipped this for me was the wonderful short stories between each chapter. Stories about fate and time, the moon and the sun, the Owl King and Princesses, swordsmiths and pirates. Erin Morgenstern's imagination is unparalleled, I just can't give it 5 stars because I didn't fully understand some parts of the world.  "If all endings are beginnings, are all beginnings also endings?" ******************Just picked up this beauty from the library. I didnâ€™t love The Night Circus - too romancy for me, but I could appreciate its beautiful and imaginative elements. Iâ€™m looking forward to this one ðŸ˜Š
