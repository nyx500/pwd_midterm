[4.5] "And so she looked down at her son and loved him with the kind of twisted, complex feeling that came from having never wanted him in the first place; she loved him with bitterness, and she loved him with resignation. She loved him though she knew no good could ever come from such a bond." i've thought about it a lot and, you know what, i kind of get where book eaters are coming from: if i could eat—and i mean, physically ingest—this book, i probably would. i'm not even ashamed. that's how good it is. The Book Eaters pretty much has everything i love in a novel. it has stunning writing, a unique and fascinating plot, and the icing on the cake: complex, morally gray characters with relationship dynamics unlike anything i've ever seen. i'm not usually a fan of books where the protagonist has children, but the way Sunyi Dean wrote Devon's rage every time her child came to harm, the way she became completely unhinged? yes, extremely satisfying. female rage at its finest. personally, i think literature needs more women who will literally rip a man's throat out with their bare teeth when provoked!i hadn't searched anything about this book beforehand, so what a nice surprise it was to discover there was a bit of sapphic romance sprinkled in there too! it's less than a subplot, but still—Hester and Devon's relationship, though it takes quite a long while for anything to happen between them, was the perfect way to uplift an otherwise bleak-ish story! only one thing prevented it from being a 5-star read for me: although they are perfectly well developed and so interesting to read about, i didn't connect with the characters as much as i had hoped. i loved them, but it was just missing that special spark that makes you unhealthily obsessed with them, which is unfortunately one of the first things i look for in any book. but the rest was just so perfect that i can't bring myself to hold it against the author! everyone please go read this.
