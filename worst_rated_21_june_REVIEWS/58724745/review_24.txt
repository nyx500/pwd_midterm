3.5 starsThis was a unique urban fantasy novel that was kooky and a little cozy. I've seen people classify this book as horror, but as a horror I actually thought this book was quite cozy. Something about it reminded me of the children's books, The Burrowers. Yet there is a lot of depth and complexity to the characters and the world in which they live. Like most readers, I loved how the book eating was incorporated in the book and how different story affected the people who consumed them. It was a rather clever commentary on the experience of reading. I would recommend this one to readers looking for something different than the average urban fantasy. Disclaimer I received a copy of this book from the publisher
