Nearer to 3.5, than 4 stars, but Goodreads hasn't got that option, The Book Eaters is an interesting take on the euphemism of devouring books, because the creatures in this world really do that. There's lots of good stuff to enjoy in their world. Books taste different according to their subject matter; for example, fairy tales are frothy and sweet. I would have liked to have delved into their weird world more than the author does.The book eaters live on the outskirts of the human world and mostly have contempt for us.Devon is a twenty-something year old book eater, who we meet first as a girl. She doesn't question the book eater's way of life until her daughter is taken away from her. She fights from that point until the end of the book to be given a modicum of decency and kindness and the right to raise her child.
