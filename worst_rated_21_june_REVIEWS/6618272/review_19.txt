Wow, Kiera Cass has such talent. She is definately an author to watch! The Siren covers decades all in 276 pages, and you never once find yourself bored, only overcome with a need to know what happens next. You grow with the characters and experience their life. The Siren had me crying at numerous points and I'm by no means a big crier in books. It wasn't just sad parts that had me crying either, I was tearing up over some of the happiest parts of the book. Parts of The Siren were so heartbreaking, but there were so many parts that were full of joy, happiness, and life. Every time I found myself putting it down, I was plotting how to find time to read more. The first half was more about the life of a Siren, and what Kahlen and the others go through, but the second half sends you plunging head first into the perfect romance Kahlen finds with Aklini. Aklini is about the sweetest guy ever! You fall for him the moment he walks onto the page. The characters Cass creates are just phenomonal. Even the minor characters that play a smaller part are so filled with life. Even the Ocean herself is a character; she speaks, breathes, and causes everything to happen. This sets The Siren apart from other books dealing with the same subject, and enhances it. Kahlen was such a strong character, and that was one of my favorite things about her. Strong female characters make everything better. Cass's writing was such a joy to read. It was beautiful and was filled with hope, joy, and heartbreaking moments. The story she writes was so unique, and she simply draws you in. The Siren is a story to take you on a journey and stay in your heart. The Siren is a book for anyone who loves a story to get lost in. I cannot wait to see more works by Kiera Cass.
