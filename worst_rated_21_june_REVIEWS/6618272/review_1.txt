All in all, I liked this book, it was fresh, cute and a fast read, and that's what I needed (because I've been reading heartbreaking, sad books). That said... it was not what I expected. In good ways and in bad ways. Let's start with something I'm not sure if I liked or not, but it sure had me intrigued: The Ocean.I really liked Her sometimes, but there were other times that She just confused me. I mean, I liked the idea, I think that She was the strongest character of the book, and it's the first time I read something like it. Her relationship with the girls was one of my favorite aspects of the story, it was very motherly. Akinli was another character I really enjoyed reading, he was just too sweet, caring and funny. I just wish we had more of him in the book. Also! I liked that I thought I knew how his story would end and NOPE! Kiera really surprised me this time :P. I'm not saying I loved the way it ended, but it took me by surprise! Definitely not the clich√© I was expecting.Now let's talk about Kahlen... I kinda like her, but not so much. I'm in a point of my life were I can't stand characters whose only aspiration in life is to get married. I also feel that she was unfair with her sisters most of the time... and half of the book she was just bitter and depressed. Blah...Hmmm what else? Oh! THE INSTA LOVE. I mean, it wasn't exactly insta love, but it happened way too fast! I can accept that she instantly had a crush in Akinli (I mean, I would've, too!)... but then in one day she was suddenly in love. What. THEY WERE CUTE TOGETHER! But I'm not a fan of the whole "soulmates" thing when is not well developed :/... That's everything I got to say (for now). I enjoyed the book, the ending felt satisfying, but that's all.
