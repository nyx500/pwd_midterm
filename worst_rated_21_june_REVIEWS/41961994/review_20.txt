We are the dreams that did not die with the dreamer.Story 🌟🌟🌟🌟Stories want to change, and it is a librarians job to preserve them, that’s the natural order of things.In hell there’s a special place for anyone and anything. Even unwritten books. And when there’s a library, a librarian isn’t far. Claire is the librarian since... a long, long time. Her work is nearly always the same. Find escaped characters, bring them back into the book. Care for books, repair books etc etc etc. But one day something is different. A demon is in her library and he’s giving her a message - a character escaped. They’re searching him in the real world, but the adventure doesn’t stop there. There is a world filled with different dimension, Valhalla for the fallen warriors and realms of long forgotten gods. And hell and heavens tension get stronger and stronger each day. There’s war coming, if Claire can’t find a book first. This was actually really entertaining, even though not perfect. But the world itself was so detailed, fun and fascinating. I really loved it. And the writing was absolutely beautiful sometimes. Character 🌟🌟🌟A book playing human... but you’re not. And books belong on shelves.Claire is a librarian, there’s nothing more important than books. And a tidy, silent library. In the beginning Claire was a Stone cold woman who couldn’t care less about escaped characters. After all there were just written letters, a character in a book. Not human. But after meeting, fighting and talking to a character for such a long time, Claire’s view of things changes bit by bit, even though she doesn’t really realize it right away. I liked that even though Claire seemed like the perfect librarian, she still had a lot of room to improve, with a really great character development. The other characters weren’t that much in focus and that was really, really sad. Yes, sometimes we got snippets of background information and past lives and chapters in their POV, but most of the time that was the only thing we got. I still liked them, but I guess the weak connection with the book made me give it a lower rating. World 🌟🌟🌟🌟The unwritten is just one wing, though one of the largest. There are wings of poetry, wings of songs, wings of dying words and visions.Can you imagine that for every story you haven’t finished or written there is a book in a library in hell with a cold hearted librarian? When I started to read this I was a little bit devastated. I thought about all the stories, all the characters that were flying through my head, but never made it on paper (or on a text on my computer). It made me so sad. So, for every idea, for every story you want to write: write it. So there’ll be less books in hell waiting to be written. When unwritten books get too wild, too loved or just too hungry, they get it in their fool heads to be real.Relationships 🌟🌟🌟 Says the Woman accompanied by a muse, two demons and Prince Charming.Brevity and Claire had a tight relationship, that made me think of best friends or sisters. Claire cares for Leto (the demon) a lot and tried to save him and protect him as much as she could. Leto was like the baby of the group. Hero hated Claire like crazy. Claire hated Hero like crazy. Or not? 😉What i absolutely adored was that Claire was pansexual and Hero was bisexual. And it was absolutely normal. 😍😍😍Writing style 🌟🌟🌟🌟Stories can die. Of course they can. Ask any author who’s has an idea wither in their head, fail to thrive and bear fruit. Even though the story itself was pretty detailed, I enjoyed it a lot. The writing was so beautiful, so poetic. I was in love. The pacing was normal, but a little bit slower sometimes and all in all I was absolutely in love with the world the author created. There were a few POVs but I think the main one was Claire. All in all I had a lot of fun.  What is a Story without want, without desire, without need?
