Library of never-written books, guarded by a dead author, in Hell? Sure, you can always sell book-lovers on stories with magical books or libraries, can't you? And this was a fun enough story, with plenty of action and lots of references to literature and mythology.This was a low 4 stars for me, more like 3.5 rounded up. I was never quite convinced by the world-building, or the stakes of the plot. And while I didn't dislike the characters I wasn't passionate about them, either. When main characters die or lose loved ones and I don't have any emotional reaction, that's a sure sign that I'm not invested in them.
