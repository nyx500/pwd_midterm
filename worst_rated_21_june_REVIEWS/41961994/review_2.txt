The concept is super creative and I love the way Hackwith fully embraces getting meta and playful with storytelling and tropes. She’s crafted a magical and expansive and given personality to all of the characters. While I appreciate the creativity a lot, I couldn’t find myself attached to any of the characters or the stakes, and often found that the pacing dragged throughout an already dense story. This was a miss for me, but perhaps readers who are really into the idea of “magical libraries” might love it.
