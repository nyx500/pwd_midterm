The love story was a bit too much and happened too fast but other than that I really enjoyed this book. The story itself is quite unique and especially the atmosphere was on point! There were a few too many metaphors for my taste. Those made this whole thing feel a bit pretentious at times but that's just something I personally don't like. The twist was kind of obvious but that didn't bug me that much. It was still really interesting and the plot didn't feel any less intriguing because of that. (Potential spoiler ahead)I'm torn about the ending though. I technically loved it but especially the last few sentences felt wrong to me. I can't really explain why but it just made me feel bad for Penny. It didn't feel fair.
