If I could give this book a thousand stars I swear to God I would. Where do I begin? The story is friking magical that's for one. I know it sounds cliche but it is magical. It felt like I was thrown into this one beautiful-slightly haunting- supernatural world and I just did not want to get out. If I had the opportunity I'd never leave the friking place-no joke. The story is of three 'witches' who were drowned by a town(well, the people of the town) in the 19th century mainly because the guys were too attracted to the lasses and thought ehh they might as well be witches (again, I'm not joking) Then you get to meet our main character Penny in 21st century and how her and the town's life is affected by the three witches (because they kind of come back from the dead and drown as many boys as they can lol)The romance in this one was so cute! Romance is a very bleh aspect for me, I don't usually care for it especially in Young Adult because I find it very annoying BUT boyyy it was C.U.T.E. The guy Bo is very VERY caring, sweet and chivalrous and I just adored him.Anyway, read the book (pleasee) It is great.
