“This is how they do it—how the sisters are freed from their brackish grave. They steal three bodies and make them their own. And this season, they do it swiftly.”3.5/5 ★I was in a mood for a book that had witches and a good plot and this book was exactly it.The story was so original!It starts a bit slow but after the first 4 chapter the story begins and awesome things starts to happen. For me the best part of the book was the writing, I’m in love with it.“Love is an enchantress—devious and wild.It sneaks up behind you, soft and gentle and quiet, just before it slits your throat.” =>love this quote!!!The plot was really well done, I didn’t saw it coming.I liked the romance, how it wasn't just focused on it, and how it complemented the story. “This boy who glances at me from the corner of his eye, who feels both familiar and new all at the same time.”I like how cold the witches are. Well, 2 of them at leastOKAY, the ending was a bit of a disappointment for me. not knowing exactly what happens with the romance was a bit meh, I wish it wasn’t let it open like that and I wanted proof that they end up happy and together, at least for me that wasn’t a happy ending at all. And the end was the worst part of the book for me.Overall it had what I was expecting it, cool, fast, interesting, original and in someways funny read. Although it could have been better.
