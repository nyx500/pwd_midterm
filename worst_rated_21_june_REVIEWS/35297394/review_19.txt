*fidgets awkwardly* Sooooo....yeah that happened. I fell completely in love with Winterwood it was just so atmospheric and wintry and a perfect winter read. So I immediately ran out to my library to snatch The Wicked Deep off the shelf with the highest of hopes. But I was instantly let down. There are quite a few similarities between The Wicked Deep and Winterwood. They both have forest-green green eyed boys. And the author’s got a strange-boy-you’ve-just-met-sleep-over complex. In both books the main female character meets a stranger, a boy, and somehow he ends up sleeping at her house like that night, and soon after they’re sleeping in the same bed like little stray kittens snuggled up together in a barn like it’s nothing. And insta-love ensues.Okay. But this all worked for me in Winterwood due to the extreme circumstances and loneliness and abandonment. But seeing the same trope here, again....it wasn’t situationally warranted, in my opinion *shrugs* Also....*long sigh*...the concept was so cool. But. But really what town would just shrug and say “Oh, well. There’s nothing we can do. We deserve it.” when every year several innocent boys WILL BE DROWNED and no one does anything to stop it? Instead they throw a bonfire down on the beach like wonder who’s gonna die tonight? Har har har *stares at the wall* I just could not. Nope. I guess I read a different book from everyone else hahahaha
