sadly, this just wasn't for me - but there was a lot of good and healthy things in this book that i really appreciated! maybe i'm just being a little more harsh because i'm such a hades and persephone fan, and i just thought this fell a little flat. and truthfully, this just didn't do much for me romance wise. but i really did enjoy the aspect of the greek gods and seeing the 13 rule this version of olympus! i would love to read another book by this author in the future - so please let me know if you have a better place for me to start! (or even if i should go on to book two!) Blog | Instagram | Youtube | Ko-fi | Spotify | Twitch
