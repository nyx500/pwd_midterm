And I thought Katee Robert just wrote good smut. I have so much to learn. I’ve been obsessed with Greek mythology since I was a teenager but as the years have passed I’ve kinda lost interest. But then I was inundated with Neon Gods all over TikTok and goodreads, so I figured it was time I reacquaint myself. I’ve always been an Athena kind of girl, (goes hand in hand with placing myself in Ravenclaw) but Hades was always my favorite male. Need I explain why? I think not. Ok, it’s a little ridiculous how many butterflies I feel in my belly when Hades catches her. Guess that obsession was much like riding a bike. I’m sure this is probably obvious to anyone that’s read ACOTAR series by Sarah J Maas. But it’s just occurred to me the reason I love Rhys so much is no doubt because he’s basically Hades. Wait ... wait a goddam minute! Did she just say playroom? Are we talking about the same kind of playroom? Because if we are this book just became even better than I could’ve possibly hoped. Oh Persephone is a delight as well. I think we’d be besties, we both speak fluent sarcasm. Chivalry is not dead, folks. Just ask Hades. Goddam! Katee has a knack for setting one overwhelmingly erotic stage. I might give up my soul for a night with this Hades. And she’s a brat which just makes this so much better. So, this wasn’t as bdsm forward as I had hoped, mostly voyuerism. But honestly, even though this one had spice that’s not why I loved it. I fucking adore Hades and Persephone. They were everything I wanted and more; adorable, sweet, funny and so loving. God, I’m gonna miss them!
