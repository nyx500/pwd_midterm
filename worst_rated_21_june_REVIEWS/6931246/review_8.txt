Kraken gave me a severe case of goodreaditus, an unpleasant condition whereby as you are reading a book you are constantly thinking not about the book itself but how you are going to review it. For example I thought maybe I could borrow the voice of Cher Horowitz from CluelessHere's the four-one-one on Billy Harrow. He's like a squid janitor, he's single, he's 24 or something, quite old, and he earns minor duckets for a thankless job. What that man needs is a good healthy boinkfest. Unfortunately, there's was a major babe drought in his life. Fortunately, when his gross giant squid gets stolen, you know, like by magic, along comes PC Collingswood and she's a total betty.or maybe I could rewrite an old Monty Python sketch and put China Mieville on trial for extreme silliness. But no - Kraken isn't bad, it's just that I don't wanna be whimsical right now. So, in the time-honoured words of break-up speeches the world overChina, it's not you, it's me.
