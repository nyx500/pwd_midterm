There's something agonisingly frustrating about throwing a China Miéville novel across the room.The problem, I think, is in convincing myself that it actually deserves to be thrown. Because a Miéville novel should be brilliant. Both Kraken and the other Miéville I've read, The City & The City, are built on fascinating conceits. Like City's politically schizoid metropolis, the hidden London into which a museum curator is drawn after theft of a giant squid promises a wild, intelligently drawn and absorbing adventure.But China's writing just can't rise to the conceit. Perhaps his editor's to blame for allowing such clunky, over-written and first-drafty prose to infest the published manuscript. How could, for example, a sentence as excruciatingly confused as "We were milking leeway that would eradicate itself" make it into The City & The City? What proofreader would fail to spot the moment early in Kraken when the protagonist asks someone to clarify the meaning of a list of names he doesn't actually receive till two pages later?I dragged myself over annoyances like these in City, because City is shorter than Kraken and the over-writing is better controlled. But Kraken is so turgid, so expository, so crippled with double and triple qualifiers (Miéville will not furnish a sentence with one extended purple metaphor when three can be shoe-horned in with commas) that there it goes, arcing across my room like a startled rook, like paint in Pollock's studio, like a pop-culture reference that'll be dated in eighteen months.There are bad writers of fantastic literature. They tend to be bad writers of bad ideas. Rarer, though, is a writer like Miéville: a bad writer of excellent ideas. That's what's got me through one and a half Miéville novels, but now I've hit the wall and so, I'm afraid me old China, has Kraken.
