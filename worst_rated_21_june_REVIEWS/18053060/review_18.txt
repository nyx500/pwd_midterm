SOMEONE'S MESSING WITH HIS STORY.WHAT WOULD MR. BAUM SAY ABOUT IT?Well, I DON'T CARE. Because I LOVE this book SO MUCH!!! No joking! Even Dorothy will be dumbfounded that I'm against her now. Yes! That's how great the story is. How the author made me believe that Dorothy was no longer Dorothy I used to know. She's an EVIL now. A magic-hoarding fascist. Even her friends and Glinda had all changed. Screw them!“Down is up, up is down. Good is Wicked, Wicked is Good. The times are changing. This is what Oz has come to.”Besides Amy Gumm and Star the rat, I found some new characters here and it made the story even more interesting. The plot twist is amazing. As Amy had been warned many times, I didn't know who to trust except Amy herself and her pet rat, Star. I just love Amy. Even though she could be careless sometimes, that she put other's life in danger, but she is caring and of course she is lovable. Moreover with her condition back at the Dusty Acres before a tornado took her to Oz. She lived in a trailer with her pathetic and unreliable mother and she was bullied at school. What a life she had. Oh, this is a very funny book, too, just like the Wizard of Oz. I worship books/authors who can give me a lot of lols, especially at times like this (what am i talking about?). Besides, there are moral values in it if you look a little closer when you're reading it. One thing I didn't quite follow. While Dementor in Harry Potter sucks out happiness of others to live, why would the Lion eats the fear of others and it makes him survive and stronger? Isn't it weird? Well, whatever. It won't stop me from reading the next series. I just hope it's as great.
