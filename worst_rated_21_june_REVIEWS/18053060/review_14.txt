Think about everything you know about the Wizard of Oz, turn it upside down, right is wrong, up is down, wicked is nice, Dorothy is evil, and the witches are good. I love the imagination, wit, and brilliance of the plot. It is not your typical retelling of an oldie; it is the same world of Oz, but full of surprises. I enjoyed it; it was a fun read. 3.5 stars.
