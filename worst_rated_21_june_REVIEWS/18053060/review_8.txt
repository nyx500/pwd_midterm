I like this story better than the original one! I give it 4-4.5 starsDanielle Paige’s version of Oz is a version where Dorothy went back home, realised she didn’t particularly care for it, came back to Oz, gathered magic, and became the most barbaric ruler in the history of Oz. In this version Dorothy isn’t the only girl who went to Oz there is now another and she has seen that the Dorothy she thought she heard about let the magic get to her head and wants nothing more than to be the sole bearer of the magic residing in Oz. Amy has realised that the words ‘Wicked’ and ‘Good’ no longer mean anything in this fight to save Oz, and she will stop at nothing to kill Dorothy. “Good is Wicked, Wicked is Good”. I enjoyed the fact that the line drawn between the people who would have been considered ‘Wicked’ or ‘Good’ is no longer viable and the only person who holds the title of Wicked in this world is ironically the person who was once considered a hero. I certainly enjoyed the characters and the plot of the story but more than anything I was fascinated by how much this Oz is different from the one we heard of as kids. Dorothy turned the once magical land of Oz into this dark and twisted version where no one but Dorothy is happy. The Munchkins, the flying monkeys, the witches everything has changed and Amy is horrified by how Dorothy constantly abuses her power and tortures those not completely loyal to her cause. The sweet girl from Kansas turned evil, the magical land of Oz under the tyrannical rule of a selfish ruler. The tinman now with a heart, the scarecrow now with a brain, and the lion now with courage at their most debauched selves. And the one thing we know for sure -Dorothy Must Die
