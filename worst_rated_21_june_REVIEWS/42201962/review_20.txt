I struggled with this one a bit. I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the synopsis. Anyone looking for a fantastical black mermaid tale should be warned that this is not that. I commend the book for mentioning a part of history that often gets overlooked. Yes we know about the Middle Passage and slavery but when discussing the horrors of the journey we don't think about the slaves tossed overboard during the journey. In this story after being tossed overboard the pregnant slaves babies end up surviving having been born with fins giving them a second chance at life. I did like the parts about them creating their own society and thriving under the sea. Yetu being the historian has the job of educating her people about their past. She guides us through the traumatic history of her people and at times it's very repetitive and overwhelming. The pacing is painfully slow at times especially for a novella. Overall this is a story about survival and the importance of remembering your history no matter how painful it may be.
