- follows Yetu, who is a Historian and has to keep all of the history—intergenerational trauma and pain, essentially—of the wajinru, who are descendents of pregnant African slaves thrown overboard- takes a bit to get into (I first listened to the audiobook then switched to ebook) but worth it to keep pushing through- while it is about Yetu finding and discovering what her own identity is, separate from the trauma of her ancestors, it is also about the wajinru as a community. tackles what it means to come from a group of people whose history is full of pain, and what it means to share that pain with each other- it also is about remembering trauma and history, and where you come from, and how that can hurt yet also heal at the same time- also was not expecting a really beautiful f/f romance and I loved that! (the wajinru are also all intersex and choose their own gender, if any)- overall, a harrowing yet beautiful, moving story. definitely recommended!- bonus: audiobook is narrated by Daveed Diggs :o) (his band wrote a song that inspired Rivers Solomon to write this! highly recommend reading the author’s note at the end)—★—:: rep :: all-Black cast, sapphic Black intersex MC, sapphic Black LI, intersex characters, nonbinary side character:: content warnings :: mentions of slavery/slave trade, suicide attempt, trauma, drowning
