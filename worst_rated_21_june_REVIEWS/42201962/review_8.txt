Wow, this book is amazing. As a fan of Clipping and their Hugo-nominated song that this book is based on, I was already excited for this one---plus it's written by Rivers Solomon, author of An Unkindness of Ghosts. But wow, this book is intense. I won't give away any spoilers except to say that Yetu, the hero, is a unique character who is forced to make some tough choices to find herself, and ends up making a really beautiful and unexpected friendship as a result. I'm going to be thinking and dreaming about The Deep for a very long time. Yetu's journey kept surprising and inspiring me, even as it plunged into deeper and deeper waters that raise questions about identity and the weight of history. This is the strange, beautiful, transforming story that we all need in 2019. [Full disclosure: I received an early copy of this book for review purposes, and also Clipping vocalist Daveed Diggs kindly gave a quote for my novel The City in the Middle of the Night].
