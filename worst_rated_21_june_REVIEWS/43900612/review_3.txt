New week,  New BookTube Video - all about the best (and worst) literary couplesThe Written ReviewTwo hundred years ago Cinderella lived, and ever since then she's been an obsession of Sophia's town. She has three chances (one ball each year) to find a husband and then settle into a "comfortable" life as a wife.But she does not want that. Not. One. Bit.She is in love with Erin (even though Erin refuses to rebel) and on the night of the first ball, Sophia makes a run for it. Her life is forfeit and her only chance is to keep running. And Sophia runs into Constance - the last known descendant of the true Cinderella and her stepsisters. Together, the girls must find a way to save their town (and themselves) by diving into the true story of Cinderella...but is there time? Or are they already too late?I quite liked this version of the tale!I felt like it worked really well and I loved the blossoming relationship between Sophia and Constance - they made such a natural couple!I loved how every time we heard the story of Cinderella, there was a new twist that completely changed my opinion of the earlier versions. It was really cool (and clever) how Bayron managed that.The book did require...a bit of suspension of belief...regarding the township. The society is really, really shifted towards the most misogynistic possible structure...and I don't think there was enough background and world-building to support such a staunchly "traditional" society. But once I decided to give into the world, the rest of the book worked really well.All in all, this was the lesbian Cinderella retelling I've been waiting for.A huge thank you to Netgalley, Bloomsbury YA and Kalynn Bayron for sending me a free copy in exchange for an honest review.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
