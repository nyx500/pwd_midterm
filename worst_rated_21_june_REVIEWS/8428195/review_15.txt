There is something extremely magical about Entwined. From the author's writing style that easily flows from the pages to the otherworldly setting that wraps itself around you, instantly the reader is transformed into another dimension where magic is real and young girls dance the night away. For all its beauty, this story does have a creepy edge to it. The main antagonist of the story is dark and deadly giving the plot a much need jolt of suspense. And while the story is slow and steady verses quick and fast-paced, I felt it was just right. Entwined is the type of novel you curl up with a cup of tea and immerse yourself in. It's the type of book that pulls you in with its rich characters, extensive back story, and beautiful setting. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. I loved it for being a stand-alone. I adored it for its brilliant plot. And I embraced Azalea and her eleven dancing sisters. Combining fantasy with mystery, suspense with romance, and extensive back story with a hint of comedy, Entwined is a gorgeous spin on the Grimm Brothers' timeless classic The Twelve Dancing Princesses.
