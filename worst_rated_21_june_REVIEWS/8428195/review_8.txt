*3.5 stars* I read this as an audiobook, and recommend that medium if you aren't sure about reading this. There were some areas where this book shined and others where it faltered. First off, this is great for fans of family dynamics. This focuses a lot on sisterly bonds and father/daughter bonds especially. This would also be good for fans of novels of manners and/or lesser known Fairytale retellings.I did find that the writing was rather simple, and the book was longer than it needed to be. I find that Heather Dixon's YA leans more towards the middle grade side of the spectrum, so it and her characters tend to be a bit more immature than I like. Overall, an enjoyable audiobook but not something I would have picked up in physical form anytime soon.
