I liked Azalea and her sisters, and by the end I felt for the king as well. I hated his treatment of his daughters at the start, but the story attempts to show growth. Was it enough? I'm not sure. I liked the love interest and the romance. The villain was a good villain. The climax got a little spooky.As for a retelling, I felt this was a pretty run of the mill fairytale world. The world and magic felt pretty generic. It stuck pretty closely to the original tale in a lot of ways, fleshing out descriptions and characters, and adding a backstory and source of conflict.I think if you like 'close' retellings and fairytale worlds, you would enjoy this!Potential triggers: Pervy old man suitors, death of mother.
