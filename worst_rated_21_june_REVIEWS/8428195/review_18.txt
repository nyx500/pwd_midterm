Before Mother died, Azalea promised she would take care of her sisters.A promise that means standing up to the King. Demanding that he not forget them. And when he does—when he insists on going off war without even saying “goodbye”���it means something else.Breaking the rules. Taking the girls down through the silver forest to the magic pavilion where they can dance. And forget they are wearing black and that their father doesn’t love them and that they don’t even have a decent portrait of Mother.But in the attempt to save her sisters, Azalea may have destroyed them all.I admired Azalea’s determination, especially after her mother’s death. And I liked her younger sister Bramble’s spunky personality. As well as the atrocious Lord Teddie, the detestable Fairweller, and poor mistaken Mr. Bradford, who thinks he’s going to escape politics.
