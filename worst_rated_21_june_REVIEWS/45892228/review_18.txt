“I’m so in love with you.”I had mixed feelings about this book. On one hand I really liked the dark academia vibes and the fantastical creatures including dragons, shifters, vampires and witches, but on the other hand it felt juvenile. The pacing was well done throughout the book. The plot kept me engaged, but I was hoping for surprises and shocking revelations. I liked Grace, she is fiery, kind, strong, and independent, but she is naive at times. I really liked Jaxon, he is very handsome, sweet, strong, helpful and stubborn. I also really liked Grace's cousin Macy, she is bubbly, funny and kind. I felt there was a lack of character development, I was hoping to see more growth and depth from the characters. The chemistry between Jaxon and Grace was great. There were several swoon worthy scenes between Jaxon and Grace. The ending was exciting and shocking. I'm looking forward to reading the next book!
