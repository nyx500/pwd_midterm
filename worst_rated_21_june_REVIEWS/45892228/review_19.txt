DNF @32%I tried, I really did. It took me a week to make it to 30% and I just can't do it. The heroine is juvenile, repeating in her mind how hot everyone is. And everything is something AF. i can't count all the ways something is AF, sexy AF, creepy AF, hot AF...I expect from YA that the language is different from CR but boy, this heroine sounds like a 14 year old.Everything is cliche and not very original. I get that this has a hard time after so many amazing YA vampire books but for that it was just too much of the same. Here's my white flag.
