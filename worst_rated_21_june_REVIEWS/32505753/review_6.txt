EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK. IT IS PHENOMENAL. Theo is so strong, and actually a normal character who relates to things normally which i loved, felt i could relate to her a little better. Magic, kings, war and spying. i could barely put it down! I'm so excited for the sequel already and i can't believe i have to wait another year!And I know it had a love triangle, but it was so believable for me.And the struggle, omg. And the humiliation. Jesus Christ. Theo reminds me a little of Tris from divergent but she is such a strong young woman.
