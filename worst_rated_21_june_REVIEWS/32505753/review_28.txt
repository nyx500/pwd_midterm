2.5/3 starsThis wasn't horrible but the similarities to Ruined by Amy Tintera are so much that I am side-eyeing a bit. The plots and characters were almost identical. The romance played a big part in this book and it was so bland I ended up skimming those scenes. I probably won't continue this series since it added nothing new to so many YA fantasies I've read before.
