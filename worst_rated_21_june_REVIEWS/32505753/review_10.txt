--2.5 stars--This book was... fine. It wasn't horrible, it wasn't particularly great, it was just okay. It reads like literally any YA fantasy book you've ever read. If you're looking for something groundbreaking or innovative, then there's nothing to see here. It felt like the author had a YA Fantasy 101 handbook to refer to during the writing process. Like, there isn't a single thing I can think of about this book that gives it its own identity. Feels like it was made by a machine that figured out the algorithm to create the perfect cookie cutter YA fantasy novel, marketable and safe.I find it hard to believe that this is a 2018 release. This book would've been somewhat interesting if it was released, like, 2013 or something. Are we really still doing torn-between-two-guys love triangles in this day and age? Like, come on. Next thing you know, they're gonna be revealed to be brothers or some shit. I know in this book's case that's literally impossible, since the two love interests are of different ethnicities, but hey, it's YA. The two guys always end up miraculously being brothers lol.Honestly I really wanted to DNF this book but I powered through it cause I wanted to see how it would end. I wanted to see if this book had something that would surprise me, but nope. Nothing. I'd suggest skipping this if you're looking for something new and refreshing. If you wanna read more of the same, though, look no further. This is about as basic as it gets.
