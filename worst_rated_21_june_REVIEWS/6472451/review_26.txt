I've had this book on my TBR since it came out seven years ago @__@ I remember trying to find it in my tiny secondary school library, and searching the system for it every day until the librarian must have seen the searches and caved into buying it. And then I didn't even read it! Since then, I've loved fairy tale retellings, especially of Cinderella - who's my ultimate favourite - and the fact that this has an F/F romance in it just makes it even more amazing. It just ticks so many boxes! 20 year Maddie definitely loved this one more than 12 year old Maddie would.It felt so magical and beautifully written, with lots of legends and original fairy tales woven in to give you a great sense of the community. Adding actual fairies to fairy tales is always a good idea! If you like 'The Darkest Part of the Forest' and retellings, I'd definitely recommend this one.(Hopefully next year I'll get round to reading more of my ancient TBR books, because this was really successful!)
