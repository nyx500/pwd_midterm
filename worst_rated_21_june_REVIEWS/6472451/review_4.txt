The GoodReads five-star rating system isn't perfect because some books (like, say, pretty much all Fitzgerald and Salinger) get five stars because I think they're just freaking brilliant writing; while other books (like, say, Bridget Jones's Diary and the Traveling Pants books) get five stars because I love the characters so much. Then, of course, there are the Harry Potters and Tales of Despereaux that receive five stars because it's like they retell my whole world: Remember how lost you were when you were younger? This is what you were looking for!Ash was that last thing for me. I've always thought fairy tales were history books, always revered the Woods, always been reckless in pursuit of adventure, always wanted to fall in love with a girl. That's this heroine.Once I really got into Ash, I couldn't get out. I'm giving it four stars for freshness, four stars for writing, five stars for magic and five stars for speaking to greater truth. Plus, I am giving it five bonus stars for waking up the little kid in me. She doesn't exactly hibernate, but sometimes gets so bored with the adult world that she is forced into a long winter's nap. I loved how Malinda -- I can call her that; she was my editor once -- writes about the smell of magic. And this: "Have you ever wanted to be a princess?" Ash challenged her. "That depends," Kaisa said. "On what?" "On whether I would have to marry a prince."
