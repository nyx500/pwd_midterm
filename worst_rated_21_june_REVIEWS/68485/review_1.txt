I read very little of this book. While it is well written (I say this in respect to those who like it greatly) it is not a book I care to get involved in. The world while well crafted is one that creeps toward debauchery and cynicism on an almost monumental scale. There are actually (so far as I can see) no "heroes" here, very little that is redeeming. It's claim to fame is a drama in a world of those who see themselves as sly sophisticates. Please enjoy it if it's to your taste as fiction.. It isn't mine and I choose not to put my time into it. I'm going to update this as my review has "raised some eyebrows". In detail then, I couldn't get into the book. When I said I realized it was "well written" I said this as I saw the world building as being clear if not detailed and I could tell that the characters were at least clearly seen by the writer. On the other hand FOR ME...That's FOR ME they don't translate well. Their dialogue didn't seem natural and frankly I just couldn't care about anyone in the book. It never drew me in and I skimmed and skipped. I just wasn't into the book and didn't care about the characters or the story.For me it was a waste of my limited reading time to forge through it. There are thousands of books waiting.I know some really like this book. It's true of most any book that some will love it and some will hate it and some will be in the middle. To say a book is "good" or "bad" is in truth subjective. I can't think of a thing I like by Steinbeck. Does that mean that Steinbeck isn't a "good writer"? That's absurd. Many, many people love his work, I find it depressing and even painful. The fact that he translates that pain to paper so well simply depresses some of us more. So...FOR ME repeat FOR ME this book is a one star experience, a waste of time that doesn't draw my interest. If you like it great, enjoy. It's a matter of taste.
