I've had so much fun reading this that I'm left not knowing how much I loved the book itself. I think it's 4 stars rather than 5, and I really don't mind that I'll have to read it again to double check (just not quite straight away).Reasons to love Swordspoint: nuanced characters with great depth and personal foibles; a second world setting that could be any 18th century European city (arguably this is fantasy only because of the shelf it sits on); entertaining hi-jinks including shinnying down a drainpipe from a mistress’s bedroom wearing nothing but a hat; and some scenes all the steamier for mostly leaving things to your imagination. But mostly, I loved it for the characters and the way you’re left feeling like your heart is a much-punctured pin cushion.This is a character-driven novel of politics and manipulation. It relishes holding facts behinds its back in such a way that you know they’re there, even when you don’t know what they are. It excels at making terrible people terribly engaging. Beautiful language, acid sarcasm, biting politics, sharp swords and handsome young men up to no good. Excellent.Full review
