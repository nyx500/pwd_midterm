I am an absurd fan of this book, although to be honest I'm not sure how I would feel about it if I first picked it up today as opposed to picking it up as one of my first m/m books ever.You see, this book was first published in 1987. 1987! The amazingness of a m/m that has both a happy ending and mental illness representation is just mind blowing. It shook me then, and it shakes me now. I don't even know how to properly express it. There are books published today that don't pull this off.And the love that was expressed between the two main characters just touched me. Certainly they weren't perfect, healthy, well adjusted people, but that's part of what made it wonderful. They were two flawed individuals with problems who nevertheless cared deeply for each other and were willing to go the distance for each other even in their brokenness. It was just masterful.So, this book has a special place in my heart forever.
