Really fun - nearly 4 stars, but pulled itself short of taking advantage of its potential archetypes and mythic meanings.Aesthetically, a sort of steampunk angelology fantasy, with ghosts and immortals hard at work in a great House, sort of like Spirited Away, and a few whispers of classical tropes like underworldly journeys and a bound titan. Continuous and often-surprising action frequently threaded with short bursts of exposition, the just-enough type that keeps the story flowing but doesn't really explain.Shows a lot of potential. I expect I'll read the rest of the series.Happy Monday, everyone.
