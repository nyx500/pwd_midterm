2019 UPDATE Literally everyone else on Earth likes this book better than I do, so here's my mea culpa to the fans. $1.99 on the Kindle! Hell, even *I* bought it for $1.99. And it appears that the TV adaptation via Kung Fu Monkey Productions is still seeking a network.Rating: a grudging 2* of fivePEARL RULED at 33%Nope. Not one eyeblink more. I cannot do this. Too much is too much and the rose goblin escapade in chapter 8 lasted about a week too long.This idea is fine, though the choice of San Francisco as the intersection point between humans and Faerie borders on OTT, and I guess this could still make a good TV show if they get the budget for the f/x, but oh HELL no on the bloviations of the book.
