I really enjoyed this one, and I enjoyed the important topic of grooming and how difficult it can be to realize you are in an abusive and unsafe relationship until you are out of it. Sadly, this made the story a bit unpredictable for me, which also led to it feeling a little boring. I still really appreciate everything that was in here, and I completely recommend! Also, there were some very beautiful quotes in this book that I won't soon forget! Also, Seanan writing about the fae? A dream come true, even if I'm very late to this party!
