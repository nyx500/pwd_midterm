This is a romance wrapped up in elegant prose and powerful fantasy worldbuilding. I very much enjoyed it, particularly the magic system (sleeping gods that dream the world, magic in dance and sigils) and the relationship at the heart of the story. Both the hero and heroine were great and their relationship felt real and redemptive. A few really great moments that surprised. It does get a little repetitive in the middle for my admittedly fast-paced tastes, but others might not mind a languid stroll to an exciting climax. Do recommend.
