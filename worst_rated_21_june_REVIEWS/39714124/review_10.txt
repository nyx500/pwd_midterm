A sweeping fantasy with a gorgeous romantic heart set in a Mughal-India inspired world. Evil deathless emperor, desert spirits, magic storms, sinister cult: all glorious stuff without a goddamn orc or elf in sight. Best of all is the hero and heroine's strength. The heroine has a magic gift but it's not the usual Chosen One stuff: her main skill is that she learned how to survive palace politics as a mostly powerless person, can apply those lessons to a much worse oppression, knows how to manipulate people--but hangs on to enough decency that she does her best not to do so. Her behaviour is the kind of survival tactic often depicted as weak: well, we see the strength it takes here, and the courage that blasts through the situation in which she and her forced husband find themselves. Mehr is a fantastic creation, who gets things wrong as well as right because life sucks, and is about fifty times more empowering to read than the usual fantasy kickass woman in chain mail with a broadsword.Absolutely loved this. The romance is lovely, in particular because the hero is also not kickass: his strength is in his compassion and determination to do right, and it's perfect. Wonderful setting and magic too. Can't wait for the next.
