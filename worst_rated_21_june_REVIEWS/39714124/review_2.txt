i love going into books with no expectations because if it doesnt work out, no hurt feelings. but if it does work out, then the surprise completely makes my day. and what a delightful surprise this was!what really caught me is how much substance there is in this story, especially for a debut novel. the feeling i had after finishing this reminded me of how i feel after a nice meal - completely satiated and wonderfully content. and there is so much to feast on in this book. lush cultural magic, complex and compelling characters, and strong world-building. it has all of the right components for an enchanting tale of fantasy.the only thing keeping me from rating this higher is that it didnt really capture me emotionally. i was invested in the story, but no more than just appreciating it from a reader standpoint. i wish it had tugged on my heart just a little bit more, but overall, i really enjoyed it!i know this book hasnt made most peoples TBR, but i highly recommend it!â†  4 stars
