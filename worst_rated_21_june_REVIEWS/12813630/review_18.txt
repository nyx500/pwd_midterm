Pre-review:I quite like the world building and the story is doing well so far. Vampire virus! The undead being locked in separated towns! Reality TV featuring vampires and vampire hunters! People who want to get bitten and be vampires! What's not to love!?The ending isn't what I'd expected but I'm okay with it? I don't think there will be a sequel but if Holly Black decided to give us one, I'll be on board. Ms. Black's writing never disappoints! Hope to read more of her books later.PS: in the face of the WuHan virus pandemic, everyone please stay safe! Avoid crowded places, wear faceamasks or other protections when you go out, wash your hands often, work-from-home if you can, give support to your local medics, pressure your local government to take responsibility to safeguard your community if you must, and don't trust a word from the World Health Organization about how this isn't a pandemic yet!
