MY WTB NON-SPOILER REVIEWSeriously? This Book, three words honey---What The Buck!!!---(Can't bucking believe I'm using this pseudo-curse BUCK YOU! YOUTUBE)Well what can I say O_o??? *speechless for a moment*This book is totally bad-ass, awesome, epic, pawned, heart-stopping, hair-raising, spine-tingling, thrilling, electrifying, breath taking, totally wicked yada yada. I can go on and on but I think my limited vocabulary won't do it justice.Stars speak for yourself. Ah Hello! Hi there Blindy! Look 5 stars! 5 stars means awesome AMAZING, right? *retarded face*This book is like a puzzle(can't believe I'm doing bucking similes), it started out without any sense and lots of mysteries and questions but once pieces and pieces adds up and then you get to see at the end the finish work and it all made sense now that you know how beautiful and complicated the story is.And can I just add how creepy the book is and I was like, "Mom I swear I'm not hallucinating I can't sleep in my room and I think there's an Incubus in my closet!" And then Mom would replied, "Are you on drugs?" **Insert my WTB face here**And It's like Romeo and Juliet people!
