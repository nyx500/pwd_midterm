3.5 ⭐️ "There were too many things out there to be afraid of, too many to fight. It was a wonder anyone in Gatlin slept at all." I enjoyed this return into the Caster world, with all the old characters as well as some new faces. After the drama caused at Lena's sixteenth birthday, everything in the Caster world has changed, and no one is prepared.Evil forces are at work - Sarafine is up to her tricks, and Lena has still not chosen whether she will be a light or a dark caster.Her relationship with Ethan becomes strained, particularly when a new girl arrives to work in the Gatlin library.I liked the twists and turns the story took  like when Ridley has her powers taken away from her, and when Macon returns from the dead It was easy to get swept back up in this world, it has a bit of everything - humour, romance, fantasy and darkness. It is definitely my guilty pleasure and I am going to order book 3 from the library! "I think you'll find the impossible is possible more often than we think, particularly in the Caster World."
