I am teetering between 3.75 and 4 stars for this review, so this rating is a placeholder for now. I will be doing a full review and discussion on my channel which will be posted closer to release, and I will be talking about this briefly in this month's wrap up, but to hold you all over until then: This book wasn't quite what I expected, but it is hard to live up to the hype one builds in their head when you've been waiting for a book for literal years. Because of that, I feel I'll be sitting with this book a few days before returning for a final rating. This book could get better or worse in my head with time, and I'm unsure which way it will go. We will see how exactly it ends up haunting me.The pacing in here felt off to me at times, specifically with the relationships developing. I always knew what was going to develop but I expected it to go more slowly than it did, and that left me a little disappointed. BUT, there were THINGS that have HAPPENED that may make up for it idk. There were also some things about the plot that I wasn't following and left me a bit confused. It was as if chunks were missing at times. Additionally, there are a few things you are beat over the head with as well so it's an interesting combination. So those things prevented me from giving it a higher rating. BUT, with the few disappointments out of the way, the AESTHETICS... so on point. So dark. So eldritch. So much blood and body horror. If you are at all triggered by blood, gore, or self-harm, please stay 5000 miles away from this book. There's blood magic in it so that should be obvious, but just in case. And I do adore the characters, and am looking forward to seeing them even more fleshed out as the series continues. Lastly, although I found aspects of the romance rushed, there were still scenes that spoke to me on a deep shipping level so thats important to note. The fanart and gifsets that are going to come out of this... I am pumped.
