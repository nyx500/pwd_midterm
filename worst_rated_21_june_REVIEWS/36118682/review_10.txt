Nadya lives in a world seeped with magic and she's one of the very few remaining "clerics" that can commune for the gods (and is granted their powers on occasion).For as long as she could remember, her homeland (Kalyazi) has been at war with the heretics in Tranavia (blood magic). “We're all monsters, Nadya, some of us just hide it better than others.”When the Tranavia prince attacks her monastery, Nadya flees but not before swearing vengeance. Alone in this world, she trudges on. There's a king to kill and it's up to her to do it.“You could be exactly what these countries need to stop their fighting. Or you could rip them apart at the seams.”So.So I've heard such good things and I couldn't wait for this book to come in - it certainly sounded perfect. And for the first few chapters...it was. I haven't seen a magic system like this in YA before and I was so excited to watch it play out. I loved the idea of the divine vs the heretics warring. And the world building seemed pretty good in the beginning.BUT (and this is a big BUT)...the world building was exhausting. It just kept going. And going. And going. And I stopped caring a lonnnnng while back.I kept hoping for interesting situations to occur and...essentially SOMETHING (anything!) to happen but it felt like a sequence of flashbacks and more (and more) explanations of how their world came to be. I had a hard time connecting to the characters and was really thrown by the instalove (it felt sooo clunky).Ultimately I had to struggle (really struggle) to finish this one because I was just so mind-numblingly bored by the whole thing.But the ending was pretty nice. So. I'm gonna give book 2 a shot. Cross your fingers!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
