Well, unlike Gilded Wolves, this didn’t take eons for me to read. In fact, I devoured it in one sitting. I’m in awe that this is Roshani Chokshi’s début novel! I have no idea where the confusing, lyrical prose that other reviewers were criticising was, but I guess they probably don’t like Laini Taylor’s or Jay Kristoff’s books either...because I wouldn’t call this purple prose AT ALL. I do absolutely adore Chokshi’s descriptive writing style though, and think she has a wonderful way with words.This was essentially a Hades and Persephone retelling set around Hindu mythology, which was fascinating to me, as I’m more comfortable with Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Norse mythology. I’m not too much of a fan of the romance in this book because it was a tad too instalovey for my tastes. They fell a bit too hard for each other and a bit too fast to seem realistic. I would’ve preferred more of a slow burn, La Belle et la Bête-style. Maya and Amar did ultimately end up making a very cute couple though. My favourite character, hands down, was the flesh-eating demon horse! I absolutely adored Kamala!As someone who was reading this in an ebook format though...it would’ve been nice to know that there was a glossary at the end, rather than me having to pester my Indian friend, going “what’s this word mean?” and “what’s that word mean?” A little heads up would’ve been nice. Just saying. :PAll in all, this was a great book. I’m not certain that I’d rank it among my favourite retellings, but I am going to begin the spinoff, A Crown of Wishes, now because I hear that it’s even better than this instalment!
