you know that feeling when you finish a book and enjoy it, so you go creep on your friends reviews to see how much they like it as well, but then you have to slowly back away because more than half of them DNF’d it? no? just me? okay then. haha. yikes. i honestly had no idea so many people disliked this book. i mean, i can sort of understand how it might have bored some people, but i actually quite liked this. i thought the writing was imaginatively descriptive, the story was unique and magical, and i was pretty much entertained throughout the entire book. the only complaint i do have was the ending - it left with me with a ‘huh. okay.’ reaction, which was a little anticlimactic, but it didnt ruin the book for me. i feel so sad that a lot of people didnt enjoy this, but the book had high entertainment value for me personally.3.5 stars
