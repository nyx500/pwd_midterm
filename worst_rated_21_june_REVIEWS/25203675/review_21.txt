Roshani Chokshi paints with words. She is an artist, and this book is a like a gorgeous abstract painting - beautifully crafted and intricately detailed with a whimsical flair. Her artistry deserves nothing short of 5 stars.“I promised you the moon for your throne and stars to wear in your hair," said Amar, gesturing inside. "And I always keep my promises.” Reasons you should read this book: -Gorgeous and lavish writing- Memorable quotes that will make you think- Abstract, you'll have to dive in hardcore to get the story- Beautiful, beautiful world and mythology - The romance is sweet - Gorgeous story similar to Hades/Persephone with but with Indian mythology that I LOVEDJust be prepared to read in between the lines! At times, I was a bit confused, but this is a book to soak in and read with a glass of wine or a good cup of tea!
