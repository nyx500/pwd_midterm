I had no idea what to expect from this book, but I wanted to read outside my normal comfort zone in order to broaden my horizons. (Thanks, John, for the suggestion!) Well, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I immediately connected with both the style of writing and how the narrator presents the story as reflecting back upon his life and the choices he made or did not make. I also loved the ancient feeling of this world, although it slowly dawned on me that this actually takes place way off in the distant future. I held back from giving this 5 stars only because there are a lot of philosophical musings and other physical mysteries of the world that went right over my head. That and the feeling that this book didn't feel completely self-contained, but a continuation of reading the next book in the series is a must.EDITED: After finishing the four book series, I'm upgrading book one to 5 stars.
