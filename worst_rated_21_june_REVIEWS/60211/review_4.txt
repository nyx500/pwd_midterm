First off, the setting is awesome. Secondly, there are sentences, paragraphs, and whole sections of this book that are gorgeously written. Exquisitely crafted prose.The first half of the book is entirely enjoyable, and builds up a world (Urth) that is entirely unique among any fiction I've come across. The second half spends some time meandering. There are enough mysteries here to keep me very interested in finishing the series, because I really need to know what's going on here. It's intriguing. I'll save final judgement until I've finished The Book of the New Sun, since this is very much just 1/4 of the total story. I will say that there was a moment where I felt that the story was going off the rails, and precisely then, the protagonist chose to mention that he felt like his story was doing the same... I liked that. He compared events happening to him as being too strange, and too random, like badly written stories that he's read before.This Gene Wolfe fellow seems to know what he's doing here.
