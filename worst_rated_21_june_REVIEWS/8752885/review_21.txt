Update: somehow the second time around made me enjoy this book so much more. While some characters did not pop for me (like Marcus), I found that Geder and Cithrin were the characters I could not get enough. I loved how they are unique in some of their traits: Geder a loser and a soldier, having an awful reputation with the secret passion of essays. Cithrin is more typically falling in the category of coming of age but with the bank twist and I could not stop reading. This book, in fact, has a more intense pace than I remembered. And it ends with a bang. I am just going into the second book in the series without taking any breaks!This is a book that is a must in fantasy literature, and it is a solid 3.75. It has the right amount of war(ish), political intrigue, unusual elements (a bank!) and a veteran. The PoV are enough but not too many to confuse the reader. The characters were okay for me, nothing special and nothing bad. I did not connect with any but I was extremely intrigued by the story and it was a difficult book to put down and stop reading. Yet, I believe had a "big" miss which is the overarching story was pretty much missing. The ties are really at the beginning and at the end. And about the end, I thoroughly enjoyed 3/4 of the book, the pace was quite significant and then it slowed down a bit for me. Until the very last sentence; that one line truly blew my mind. I am in awe and I am most certainly adding this series to my TBR!
