I've been a long time picking up this series..in the end I didn't pick it up at all- it picked ME up and charged through the story with me in tow!'There are two ways to meet the world. You go out with a blade in your hand or else with a purse.‚ÄùAnd this was one of the things I loved about this book. It is an example of the fine balance between war and economics.This is character led story telling at its best.: they change and evolve, grow and transform. The world building was fabulous. I would love to see the thirteen races on the big screen.If you love fantasy and you haven't read this series yet, you're missing a trick! Of course, I've only read the first in the series so I hope those aren't famous Last Words...
