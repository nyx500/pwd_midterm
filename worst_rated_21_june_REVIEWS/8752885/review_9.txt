I have to say that this book was such a breath of fresh air for me. Have you ever had that reading rut where you feel like every fantasy book that you read has essentially the same plotline, characters, tropes etc...? Well The Dragon's Path is an amazing story that thankfully takes familiar themes but somehow manages to make them seem fresh and original. Yes there are the usual quest and battle scenes that we have grown very accustomed to in the genre. But there are als interesting sideplots that involve the finances/banking of neighboring countries and also a great deal of political maneuvering between the rulers of said countries. Abraham has always been one of my favorite authors and this book only serves to solidify that feeling. I think the guy really knows how to write characters that you come to feel invested in and his political intrigue is second-to-none. Maybe it's because he studied under George RR Martin because his style is very similar. This was definitely my favorite fantasy read in a long, long time and I unflinchingly recommend it to anyone who loves a traditional fantasy story with a bunch of new twists thrown in. Awesome book and I can't wait to pick up the next one.
