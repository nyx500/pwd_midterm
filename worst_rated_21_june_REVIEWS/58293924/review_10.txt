this one is tough to review. like many reviewers, i think this felt longer than it actually was and the first 50% dragged BADLY. very little in the way of exposition for the shadow concept so you're confused as fuck and then add about a dozen character introductions that literally do not matter? i would have dnf'd if i didn't own this book.but the second 50%... feels like holly at her best. don't get me wrong, i love the cruel prince series but i cut my teeth on tithe, valiant, and ironside when i was in middle school. i love her gritty urban fantasies. and once we get to the twists and turns? i was definitely more on board.but i do still have lingering questions... the main one being what is the point? i guess once we find out how shadow manipulation gone wrong works i was compelled. but the idea of manipulating your shadow to have horns/wings or to like do some tasks for you? i didn't understand the point unless it's supposed to be a power for power's sake/the rich can have it and you can't thing. felt like a weak reason for this magic to exist in the first place.this is one that i'm going to have to sit with for a bit. maybe revisit when the next book comes out. it's slated to be a duology (hoping it stays that way). doesn't feel like a huge time investment... but i'm not sure this is one i'd recommend to anyone that hasn't read all of holly's backlist lol
