Charlie Hall has never lucky. In life, in love, in anything. In a world where magicians can manipulate shadows, thieves are highly sought after for stealing magical books and works. Charlie used to be one of them until she was almost killed. Now she is bartending in a local dive bar, trying to live a reformed life. Until walking home late one night, she witnesses a murder which drags her back into the world full of dangerous shadows. I liked this book because it is different from the usual magic reads. The use of one's own shadow is unique. Recommend reading in the dark with no lights. Definitely not in the sun.
