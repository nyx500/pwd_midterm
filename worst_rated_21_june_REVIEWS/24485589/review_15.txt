This story had a strong fairy tale vibe with its fantasy world, fantastical creatures, and curses but it did not stick too close to the original Beauty and the Beast tale. Yes, you could easily tell who some of the characters were and assume some information about them, but it really made the world and characters their own. I think it would be great for those who LOVE fairy tales, but want a story that is still its own thing.Personally, my favorite aspect of this was that the Beast was an actual animal beast. Too many retellings, even in the fantasy genre, just turn him into some angsty rude guy. I also chuckled at a discussion of Beauty falling for her captor. Though, I have to say that the way this story built Beauty and Beast's motivations did not feel as Stockholm syndrome as the classic tale.Although this worked great as a retelling in my opinion, it was pretty weak in terms of direction. The curse was not explained sufficiently for me, the answer to everything was so obvious but took the characters until the end to realize, and the ending felt a bit rushed. The story could have definitely used some more development.Despite the plot's weakness, I was absolutely hooked while reading this. It was one of those experiences where every time I read it I would say "just one more chapter, I'm tired" and then I'd end up reading 5 chapters because I could not put it down! Spooner's writing has some quality to it that propelled me through. I did not mind the slower bits around the middle because I would have gladly spent 600 pages in this story.Also, I loved the Gaston character. He was not a sleazeball. (No love triangle.) And Beauty has a dog companion that follows her through most of the book that a lot of readers might love!Overall, though I wanted a bit more from the curse storyline, this was an enjoyable retelling and the kind of reading experience I crave. I would love to read more that Spooner has solo written and hope she does more retellings!
