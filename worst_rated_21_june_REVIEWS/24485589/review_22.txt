3.5 stars"She knew now why she was here. She would see the monster dead."Hunted is a hard one to review. I love, love, love the concept of a vengeful huntress Beauty and a cat-and-mouse game with the Beast, and the book itself delivers. Yet we didn't click the way I did with other Beauty & the Beast retellings like A Court of Thorns and Roses and Uprooted.The romance is a soothing slow burn. Those who enjoy it in small doses should read this immediately. It takes ages for Yeva (Beauty) to fall in love with her captor, and their relationship is cemented in friendship and trust. Even after she realizes she has feelings for him, she doesn't instantly abandon her quest to avenge her father. She remembers her imprisonment, she remembers the Beast's promise to murder her sisters should she try to escape.Whereas A Court of Thorns and Roses stuck close to the Disney version—and this is not a criticism—Hunted only utilizes the basic frame of the original fairy tale. Elements of another fairy tale, Ivan, the Firebird and the Gray Wolf are incorporated within. Gaston exists, but he's kind and decent, and actually earnest in his marriage proposal. Yeva's sisters love her and are the complete opposite of the traditional selfish, preening peacocks. "Yeva, you are my sister. I love you. I love you more than anything. You and Lena are the most important things in all the world." She finally squeezed Yeva's hand back, swallowing audibly. "I would give up a thousand Solmirs for you."One thing I feel the book did keep from the Disney adaption is Belle's wanting.Yeva yearns for more, a bigger world, a bigger life, just more from her existence. Hunted hits all the right notes, and I sincerely hope you give it a try. The writing, the plot, the message—it's worth it.ARC provided by Edelweiss.
