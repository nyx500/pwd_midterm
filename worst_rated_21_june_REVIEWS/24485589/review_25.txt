Well. That was weird? I've been sitting here for 10 minutes contemplating what the fuck this book was. I don't really understand what even happened and I'm confused as to how I feel about this book so let me just give you some quick thoughts- I didn't like the Beast. Sorry but he reminded me of Tamlin the entire time. I felt like this Beast had no likeable qualities and was just a big ball of a shit. I would have preferred if he died. Oops? - I didn't ship it at all. Not once. Not ever. - I liked Yeva. I thought she was a great main character but she did get a bit weird at the ending and once again it would've been better if she didn't go with the Beast. - I was intrigued the entire time and it didn't really leave me bored at any stage - hence the 3 stars when it easily could've been a 2 stars. - I'm disappointed. I was really looking forward to this book and it ended up being a big ball of weird nothingness.
