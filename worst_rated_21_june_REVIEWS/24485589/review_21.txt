Full Review Real rating: 4.5ðŸŽµTale as old as timeSong as old as rhymeBeauty and the beastðŸŽµI loved this so much!I have read like 4? 5? Beauty and the Beast retellings because I obviously have a problem and I am not ashamed of it. What I love most about this is that Beast is actually a beast. I think this is the only book in which that was the case. At the beginning, we have Beauty having some type of identity crisis because she feels like she is destined for more than what is expected from a woman in her land. She enjoys hunting and being outside. What I loved most about her was that she was not judgmental. She never judged women who were into traditional things like wanting to get married and being homely. In fact, her two sisters were like that and they were all close!Another thing I liked was that when they introduced a guy that wanted to marry her, he was actually someone kind, loving and actually liked that she enjoyed hunting. So he wasn't any 'Gaston'. Even with this, there was no love triangle!! I liked how the romantic plot in this ended.Then there is the relationship between Beauty and the Beast. I loved reading it, especially since Beauty really hated Beast for a long time bc of something. I loved reading about Beast and his struggles with his humanity. He had his POV but they were usually like less than a page, in-between Beauty's chapters. Reading about his inner struggles was so devastating ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Why 4.5 and not 5 I felt like the second half of the book, towards the end, was kinda slow. Also, I wasn't really satisfied with how it ended. Like I enjoyed it, but I wanted more. I think this is like the least romantic retelling of this story.
