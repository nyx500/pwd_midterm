REVIEW TO COME TODAY.Me : *sighs* Person : are you okay?Me : yeah, I'm just disappointed. Me : *facepalm*And as Yeva scanned the walls, each one lined with shelves and each one full of leather-bound books, at least a hundred books, more than sheknew existed in one place, she felt her heart might simply burst. I truly don't know why I didn't really like this book. Maybe it's because I was in reading slump while reading it ? or maybe it was just the book that wasn't really interesting ? the reason is either of them. Before I read this book, I kind of had high expectations about it because I heard so many great things about it and even though, retelling is not one of my favorite genres, I still like reading it. I was so excited when I first started reading it, like really really excited. THE BLURB SOUNDED GOOD TO ME. This was what I felt when I began reading it. I was excited and the beginning of the book was pretty good.but then the more I read it, the more I realized that this book didn't meet my expectations. I thought this book would be action-packed, but it wasn't. there're several action scenes in this book but it's not enough and oh my God, there were a lot of information and too much talking and NOT ENOUGH ACTION SCENES. I READ THIS BOOK JUST BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ACTION-PACKED. OH AND I CERTAINLY DON'T NEED THE DRAMA BETWEEN YEVA-SOLMIR-ASENKA. UGH. I'm going to speak about them but I have to put spoiler tag on it, because I'm afraid someone would be spoiled. SPOILER!Look, I don't need the drama between Yeva-Solmir-Asenka. Like why didn't Solmir and Asenka just end up together without involving Yeva? this drama is so fucking unnecessary and I hate it so much when a romance involves with a guy and two girls but the two girls are sisters.I don't know whether Solmir loves Yeva or not at the beginning of the story but I am sure that he has feelings for her at the beginning of the story, for he proposes her and then when Yeva goes into the woods and she doesn't come back for almost a year because she is held captive by the beast and when she comes back, Yeva realizes something is wrong with Solmir and that is because he has fallen in love with Asenka and he even asked Asenka to marry him, months ago, when they believed Yeva was died but Asenka refused the proposal because she knew Yeva was alive and she would come back and Asenka wouldn't betray her sister and after that Solmir and Yeva broke their promises and then Asenka and Solmir end up together in the end because they love each other. SO THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THE FUCKING POINT OF THAT DRAMA? IT SO FUCKING POINTLESS. I AM SO MAD. I know that Yeva does not love Solmir the way Asenka loves him, even at the beginning of the story Yeva does not even love Solmir but seriously this drama is so fucking pointless. I HATE IT SO MUCH. END OF THE SPOILER.and now the romance between Yeva and the beast. I consider it as enemy-to-lover-kind of romance. Yeva hates the beast at the beginning but then she slowly ... understands the beast? well, basically she develops feelings toward the beast but the saddest thing is, I could not feel anything for them. Not even a spark. Their romance was just boring for me. I felt as if the romance was forced.I don't know what else to talk about. I did enjoy reading it at the beginning but then after that the realization sank in that it didn't meet my expectations and then there was that whole drama that I hate. *sighs* I guess, the only thing that I loved in this book was the bond between the sisters. The bond was beautiful and sweet. I have a big sister and I love her so much and I certainly could relate to the bond between Yeva, Asenka and Lena. I don't understand about the ending. I think it's because I skimmed reading it a little bit. So how could the beast turn into a human? if you know, please do tell me on the comments section and don't forget to put spoiler tag on it. Thanks! <3  I may do not like this book, but please if you want to read this book then go read it! maybe you will love it, who knows, right? and than you very much for reading and liking this review. I appreciate it so much, guys. *hugs* 🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾MY FINAL EXAMINATIONS ARE OVER. Now, I can read a book as long as I want. MUAHAHAHAHA.🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾
