Real Rating: 3,5 starsBone Crier's Moon tell us the story of three main characters: Sabine, Ailesse and Bastien. Sabine and Ailesse are best friends and part of a clan of Leuress, women who ferry the dead into the underworld or paradise. They must do it with the help of bones from animals and a sacred bone flute. If the dead are not ferried they become something like invisible danger. Bastien is a boy driven by revenge because his father was killed by a Leuress. And so our story begins.Even if the book also overused YA tropes, I was still invested in the plot and the trope of star crossed lovers. Honestly, I did not care much for Sabine's POV, but I loved Ailesse's. So without further delay, what I liked:- The concept of the star-crossed lover called "amour√©" acting as a sacrifice for a bigger end. - Strong friendships.- The mythology the author created (Bone Criers, Leuress etc).- I liked to see roles reversing: at the beginning, we have one "less strong" girl and one "stronger". In the end, their roles are somehow reversed but in a good way.- I liked to see a parental figure that actually had some complexity in her and was not just the usual "parent is villainized because yes". - The gorgeous cover. I would buy this book just for it, really. What I did not like:- I do not like the part where they have to kill animals, but I understand the purpose of it...but it still hurt. I wish there was no need for that. It left me uncomfortable and I had to ignore it in order to enjoy the book. I lowered my rating because of it.- The plot twist at the end was a bit weak because at the beginning of the book I totally saw it coming. Maybe if the first meeting scene wasn't so fast...- Supporting characters were okay. They have plenty of potential to develop in the next book. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I'd recommend it for those who enjoy French Folklore or enemies to lovers trope.
