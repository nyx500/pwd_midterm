Finally finished!!! Ok so I don’t frequently read YA or fantasy and obviously not YA fantasy but something about this book just drew me towards it.This was very fun and atmospheric I really enjoyed the world and the magic system it was something that I had never read before. It was a little slow to start but then started to pick up its pace around the 50 page mark. That being said I didn’t love this one. The book was perfectly fine it just didn’t click with me. I think if YA fantasy is your typical genre then probably you will really enjoy this one! Especially if you love a sprinkle of romance within your fantasy books.
