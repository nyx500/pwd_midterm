*Rated 3.5/5 starsOk, so this was set to be a 4 star read for the most part. I really enjoyed how melodramatic it was, it being high stakes life-or-death from the very beginning. It was fascinating learning about the Bone Crier’s lifestyle, their systems and history that ultimately lead to this moment in the book. I also found the characters fun to read about, the personalities feeling authentic and crashing together in this dramatic culmination of a story.But then we got to the last 50 pages or so, and the drama turned...less believable, I guess? It was almost as if this book threw in a bunch of dramatic YA tropes at the last minute to raise the climatic scenes more than the melodrama already achieved. But because it was so hastily thrown in towards the end, it just lost any authenticity it had. I’m not usually bothered by YA tropes, but they definitely could’ve been woven in more smoothly or subtly to avoid them crashing into the story haphazardly at the end. So it kinda lost a bit of its 4 star status for me, docking it down slightly to 3.5 stars. That being said, it proved to be a super quick and fun read. I haven’t read a story like it in terms of the Bone Crier set up, and will be continuing the series when the sequel is released. Pretty good for a first book in a series!
