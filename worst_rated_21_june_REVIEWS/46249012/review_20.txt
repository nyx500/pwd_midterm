Bone Crier’s Moon⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️What a book! The world building was absolutely amazing✨ These myths about Bone crier’s and their gods, beliefs and Light fits my aesthetic too well🌅 But first, let’s admire the beyond beautiful cover illustrated by Charlie Bowater! I love Bowater’s work, and this cover is everything🌙But let’s move on to the characters cause I got some tea🍵 Where is the depth may I ask? It took some time to get to know these characters, and I still feel they’re just strangers. For example, Bastien grew up alone and became a wanted thief. That’s basically all we got, where’s the backstory?🙈The only character who developed throughout the book was Sabine, and to be honest I don’t think it was enough. The only think she achieved was that she wanted to get better at killing⚔️I wanted that relationship badly💗 This had such potential, but I just didn’t care about them. It felt forced, like suddenly they where in love because why not.I’m still interested to read the sequel, I need to know where this is headed. Though I expected more����
