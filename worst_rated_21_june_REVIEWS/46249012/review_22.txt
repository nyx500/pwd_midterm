Meh. I don’t get the hype. It was ok, but just that. Ok. Contrary to other reviewers, while I didn’t particularly care for the animal killings, I didn’t think they were too graphic or extreme either. My main problem were the characters themselves. I loved Sabine, but I think that the book would’ve been better if it solely focused on her, rather than having 3 POVs (which changed so abruptly btw). I didn’t care for the other two at all. They were rather bland characters and weakened the book with their so-called romance. I found Sabine to be a much more empathetic and relatable character, in comparison. I don’t think that I’ll be continuing this duology. There are better fantasies out there.
