Thank-you, Edelweiss, for providing me with an ARC in exchange for an honest review! I thoroughly enjoyed this and feel like it’s an easy story to read in one sitting. Not because it’s a simple story but because it’s  addicting.  The world is unique and so is the magic system. I've never read a book like this one, where the characters use animal bones and get strength and power from them depending on what animal it is they killed. I loved every minute of it.This story is full of star-crossed lovers, enemies to lovers, siblings, characters you can’t trust, and one hell of a compelling plot.  I will for sure be buying myself a finished copy when it gets released in March 2020. -----------------------------------Okay, who gave someone the goddamn right to not only make this cover gorgeous, but to have it set to come out in 2020???  I just wanna talk...
