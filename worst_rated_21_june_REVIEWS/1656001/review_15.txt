Body and soul. Two different things.This book is SO MUCH BETTER than the Twilight series. ✅ Amazing main character✅ Great secondary character ✅ Hate-to-love✅ Beautiful writing✅ Such a sweet story about acceptance of our differences❗️❗️ Be sure to have kleenex near you when you read this book (or maybe it's just me...)  “But what if it were you?” Ian asked in little more than a whisper. “What if you were stuffed in a human body and let loose on this planet, only to find yourself lost among your own kind? What if you were such a good…person that you tried to save the life you’d taken, that you almost died trying to get her back to her family? What if you then found yourself surrounded by violent aliens who hated you and hurt you and tried to murder you, over and over again?” His voice faltered momentarily. “What if you just kept doing whatever you could to save and heal these people despite that? Wouldn’t you deserve a life, too? Wouldn’t you have earned that much?” Sweet, perfect Ian. He is definitely one of my all-time favorite characters. He is so kind, thoughtful, and amazing. I love him. ❤️  Because he was a soul, by nature he was all things good: compassionate, patient, honest, virtuous, and full of love.The Host takes place in a post-apocalyptic reality. Parasitic aliens have taken over the Earth, they travel from planet to planet, and are implanted in host bodies to experience what it is to live as different species. They are virtuous and peaceful beings, trying to perfect our world and create a utopic planet where human violence and greed do not exist anymore. When a Soul is implanted in a body, the host's consciousness usually fades away, but not in the case of Melanie Stryder. When a Soul is put into her body, Melanie refuses to give up and disappear, and her mind battles with the Soul's mind (Wanda) as the story progresses.I love that the main character is Wanda, the alien, but since she is sharing a body with Melanie's consciousness, we get to know them both intimately, and we realize that the Souls might not all be as bad as they seem. I am usually not a fan of alien stories, but this tale is more about what it truly means to be human, what differentiates us from the alien Souls, and why some humans keep resisting and fighting to remain free. A big part of this story turns around a moral dilemma: are we worthy caretakers of the Earth, or do we deserve to be conquered by the pacific Souls that know how to create a world where harmony and peace are dominant, and where the ugliness and flaws of human nature would not be a problem anymore? The fact that the story's main character is Wanda, a Soul that is pure and kind, and does not want to hurt anyone, forces us to see and understand both sides of the dilemma.  “This place was truly the highest and the lowest of all worlds - the most beautiful senses, the most exquisite emotions.. the most malevolent desires, the darkest deeds. Perhaps it was meant to be so. Perhaps without the lows, the highs could not be reached.”Where Wanda is gentle and kind, Melanie is fierce, stubborn, and loyal. She has learned to be ruthless in order to survive, hide, and protect her family in this world where free humans are hunted. Being forced to cohabit with Wanda creates a lot of internal conflicts and very interesting dialogues between the two characters, each one having her own distinct voice and personality. As the story progresses, Wanda and Melanie will become unlikely allies and will have to learn to trust each other and rely on each other in order to survive and protect their family.  “You are the noblest, purest creature I've ever met. The universe will be a darker place without you," he whispered.”Add to this compelling and original story a beautiful slow-burn romance, and even a kind of love triangle (but it is very well done!), and you are in for an incredible and beautiful adventure, full of emotions. I don't think I will ever tire of re-reading this book.  "It's not the face, but the expression on it. It's not the voice, but what you say. It's not how you look in that body, but the things you do with it. You are beautiful." Follow me on Instagram 🙂
