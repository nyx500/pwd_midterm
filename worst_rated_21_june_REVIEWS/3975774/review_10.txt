I’m not surprised that I devoured this novel. I’m a fantasy junkie, what can I say. I’ve been pinning after this book for what seems like forever, so of course I had high standards. And honestly most of them were met, there were a few things that I would have loved to seen Noel elaborate on, but overall I was utterly and completely satisfied. Let’s start with characterization. Ever was a solid character, I got her guilt, I understood her struggle, and her name is Ever.... could that possibly mean she lasts forever. Secondary characters were a little flat to me, I felt like Miles was a stereotypical gay male character, I would have liked to have seen him a little more three dimensional. Damen is, hot, yes... but what is his story?! I’m hoping to learn more about him in the rest of the series. He hasn’t really impressed me much yet, but that may change. Drina as the antagonist, it think maybe my biggest complaint, the whole explanation sort of wrecked the ending for me. You’ll just have to wait and see, because I don’t want to elaborate to much on it. It’s actually one of the things I wished Noel had elaborated on a little bit more. Too far fetched maybe, or just possibly just a lack of explanation. I loved the story itself, the plot was engaging, I really had no idea what was going on. I kept waiting for one big revelation, but really it’s just revealed piece by piece which was a welcoming change of pace. The writing was marvelous! Impressive imagery! It was customary to find myself lost within the novel. 		I cannot wait to read the rest of the series! There is a sneak peak of the next cover in the back of the novel, and it looks spectacular! I only wish it was in color.
