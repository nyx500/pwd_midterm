Having satisfied my curiosity about this popular YA series, I can safely scratch the rest of the books (and their author) off my TBR list forever.The book starts off OK - mind-reading, auras, family drama, but very swiftly becomes just another pathetic Twilight rip-off. Same worn out story of an insecure girl falling for a mysterious/sexy/dangerous paranormal guy, same absent adults, same "love" without really knowing each other, same focus on outer beauty and expensive things, same gazing into each other's eyes, and same chaste sleeping in the same bed. Well, you know the drill.The characters are flat, unrelatable, stupid, and acting out of character whenever it is convenient, the relationships are shallow, the style of narration is juvenile, the mythology is full of holes, the story itself is boring, unoriginal, unexciting, and full of clich√©s. Pretty much, a waste of time. Putting this next to other mediocre Twilight rip-offs "Shiver" and "Hush, Hush."Reading challenge: #1 - E.
