This was a YA paranormal romance story, about a teen psychic.I liked Ever and I felt really sorry for her the way she had lost her family in such tragic circumstances. I liked Damen too, but he was a little irritating with all the red tulips all the time.The storyline in this was about Ever having been in a car accident that killed her family, and left her with psychic powers. We then had Damen, a new boy at school, who strangely had no aura, and we spent most of the book then trying to figure out what exactly Damen was and what he wanted with Ever. I found this to be a pretty good story though, and it held my interest throughout. The ending to this was also pretty good, and I am definitely interested to see where the series goes from here. ★★★★★★★★☆☆8 out of 10
