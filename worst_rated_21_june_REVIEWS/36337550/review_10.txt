Reading The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle left me MIND BLOWN!🤯 What an intricately layered and amazing plot. If you haven't read this one yet, please jump into this book blindly and savor every moment. At times you will feel like you are flailing in the water, drowning in confusion. Just keep reading, treading through the chapters as you go. Grab hold of the bits that are sent your way and store them. It will all make sense in the end!I thought I was prepared for Turton. I read carefully, giving the book my full attention. I even re-read parts to be sure I understood what I thought I was meant to understand. Still, I did not fully see where I was being led. This was an outstanding literary puzzle! It was not only an expertly crafted whodunnit, it truly ends up being so much more. 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ and I'd give it more if I could. I love to be challenged and surprised by a book and this one did that and then some. 🙌🏽What a debut! I can not wait to see where Turton's mind takes us next. I'm there for it!Thank you to Stuart Turton, Sourcebooks Landmark and NetGalley for an advance copy to read in exchange for my honest review.
