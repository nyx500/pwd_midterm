3.5 stars üåü I have no idea how I actually feel about this one!This was probably one of the most confusing and complex novels that I have ever read. I actually quite enjoyed the premise of this story as it definitely was quite clever and really made me think but in the end I was a little disappointed with the ‚Äúwhat just happened?‚Äù ending which left me feeling a little unsatisfied. I felt a little bit cheated as I was so hoping the ending would have been just as complex and clever as the rest of the novel but for me it just seemed a little too easy.This was a Traveling Sisters Read that I read along with Berit and Marialyce. We all ended up having pretty much the same thoughts and conclusions upon finishing this book.Thank you so much to Edelweiss, Stuart Turton and Sourcebooks Landmark for the opportunity to read an advanced copy of this book in exchange for a review.Review written and posted on our themed book blog Two Sisters Lost In A Coulee Reading.https://twosisterslostinacoulee.comCoulee: a term applied rather loosely to different landforms, all of which refer to a kind of valley.
