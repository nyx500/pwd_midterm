As an allegory for colonization and its impact on the colonized, this is stunning and gorgeous and I enjoy analyzing it in spare moments, like when I'm tired of working or am eating a cookie that is not so delicious as to require my full attention or am in the shower.As a story in and of itself, I did not enjoy it. But who cares.The writing style of this was pretty stilted, in my opinion (and I kept catching myself doing that nightmarish thing where I feel obligated to rewrite awkward sentences), but again - basically beside the point.Weird that in many ways this was absolutely not my cup of tea, and yet there's no way I'd even consider giving it under four stars.Bottom line: I love a text I can really think about!!-------------spooky season spooky season spooky season spooky season spooky season spooky season
