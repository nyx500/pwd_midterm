Well, I can't say I've been charmed by a book more in a while, and jealous I didn't write it. This is a totally hipster book that rings all my bells, I feel like it sort of summarizes the zeitgeist of our internet generation, the gap between old and new.Basically the main character, Clay, is unemployed tech guy, gets a job in a run-down bookstore that has a mysterious agenda that he can't help but get roped into. I'm a sucker for secret societies, and there's a touch of Amelie whimsey that is right up my alley in this as well. I mean, Google comes into it, it's so almost a cliche for me this book!If I were to quibble, it's that the ending isn't quite dramatic enough, but the journey was so fun I can forget that. Recommended!
