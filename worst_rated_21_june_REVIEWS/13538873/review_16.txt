DNF @ 48%Just... so very boring. There's literally a MAGIC BOOKSTORE this should be AMAZING. But instead it wastes time on:- a protagonist so boring I've forgotten his name- a manic-pixie-nerd-girl who's soooo down-to-earth guys (she seriously only owns 10 replicas of the same shirt because she just DOESNT care about fashion and she works for Google, she's just super chill, okay??) - random my-roommates-are-making-out-drama- a bunch of technobabble about how because of Kindle and Nook books will die out and we will live in a sad, desolate future. There's a somewhat interesting mystery that kept me going for a little while, but the story forgot to make me care?
