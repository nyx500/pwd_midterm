YOU GUYS.With a release date of July 12, I feel that's about all I can say. So since I can't talk about the book, I'd like to take a minute to talk about the acknowledgments section, where Maggie says goodbye to Mercy Falls and the world she created there. It was one of my favorite worlds to read in over the past few years, since first picking up Shiver on a whim at Book Expo in 2009. And when she wrote about Sam and Grace's relationship, and her statement to readers who always ask how they can find their brand of loyal, enduring love, I couldn't help but get a huge fat emo tear in my eye. I didn't grow up surrounded by healthy relationships and have had to push and shove my way into becoming an adult who can recognize and participate fully in one. So it's no surprise I have a soft spot for working with older tweens and teens who aren't either in that position either. To have a book that I can place into their hands without being totally obvious what I'm trying to point out to them is powerful and I know from those few sentences alone that Maggie gets the importance of it too. I've got so much respect for her and love following her travels or hearing where her next big talk will be. Over the past 48 hours, I've had a hard time trying to explain the series to those who haven't heard of or read it. It's funny to hear myself get choked up with enthusiasm while talking about what is -- essentially - a werewolf book. But the cathartic response I had to finishing the series on my day off from work bathing in the late afternoon sunlight as the wind rustled through the trees was so strong that I'm sure it will stay with me a long time.
