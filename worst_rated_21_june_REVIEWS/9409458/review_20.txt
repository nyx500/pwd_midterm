LOVE LOVE LOVE this conclusion to Sam and Grace's story. One thing I love about Maggie Stiefvater's writing is the way she manage to bring her characters to the end of a personal journey over the course of their narrative arc. And that was so rewarding to read here. Grace is a wolf when we start out. Sam is human, and missing her terribly. We soon find out the wolves are in terribe danger and Sam and Cole must figure out how to keep the pack safe permanently. But again, the best part was the character journey. As we count down to the final moments and realize the wolves will be hunted down by helicopter and potentially exterminated, each character faces the thing they haven;'t been able to. Sam is no longer afraid. He willingly becomes his wolf to save Grace. Grace confronts her parents, FINALLY, as an adult, for all their years of neglect. Cole, who has spent how many years trying to kill himself, drags his dying carcass into the woods, desperately trying to live. And Isabel saves the wolves even though she couldn't save Jack.  Loved.
