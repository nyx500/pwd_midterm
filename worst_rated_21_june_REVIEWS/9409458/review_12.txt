Ms. Stiefvater completely outdid herself writing Forever. The characters that we met, loved, and sometimes despised,in Shiver and Linger are more vibrant than ever. We get to know Isabel and Cole much better in Forever, and that knowledge makes them each a bit more endearing. The relationship between Grace and Sam still feels new and exciting, yet undoubtedly true and well...."forever" love. This stunning conclusion moves faster than even Shiver and Linger did, sometimes I wanted to find out what happened next so badly, that I'm afraid I missed some of the amazing and unique details that I love so much in Ms. Stiefvater's novels. Along with her many other fans, I have been anxiously awaiting this book, and I was not, for one milli-second, disappointed. This was totally true to Ms. Stiefvater---not everything is tied up with a pretty bow, the good guy doesn't always win, and the bad guy isn't always apprehended....but the reader is completely satisfied!I have purchased all three books as a gift for my niece, and I will pre-order another Scorpio Races, just for her.
