guess who's backback againchandler's back (on her FANTASY SHIT) tell yo friendsit's gonna be real hard for me to objective here. the only other fantasies i've read thus far in 2019 have been cassie clare books & morgan rhodes book. which i adore. but i haven't read a truly ORIGINAL fantasy this year.and honestly thank fuck for claire legrand. this was phenomenal. and again, maybe i just haven't read fantasy in a while but i don't think that's it. i really do think this was awesome.first off let's address why other people did not like this book and why i didunlikable main characters: ok but sign me tf up. 2 pretty powerful, power HUNGRY, unlikable women with a thirst for blood and sex? i fucks heavily with it.bisexuality issues: i listened to the first part of this on audio so maybe i missed the issue but seriously what is everyone on about? my bi ass had no issue.complicated/unexplained magic & religion: i thought it made sense given that this is a three book series, that not everything would be instantly given to us. it was no confusing to me, and it left me wanting to know MORE. which is sort of the whole point of a book 1 in a seriesnow let's just talk about shit i liked cause i'm feeling lazy- rielle- elliana- audric- CORIEN- SIMON <33333333333333333- the PLOT- the TWISTS just everything ok? see above. i'm lazy.if you're a fan of throne of glass or hunger games i think you will really fcking enjoy this. go read it :)
