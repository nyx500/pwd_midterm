GUYS! WHAT A BOOK! ah, I still can't believe that something this awesome had escaped my knowledge! this book is amazing and I am so jealous of the world that Shannon has created! truly, truly a masterpiece. if you're a fan of awesome fantasies & glorious world building then this is the book for you!seriously, read this book! it's a bit hard to start but after 50 pages, you get it. and I would recommend listening to the audiobook because there were so many words that I would have mispronounced. like LOADS OF WORDS LOL so the audiobook was a big help to get all of the new words right. I can't wait to read the sequel! I need more of Warden & Paige & Nick & Jaxon! (but mostly Warden ha ha ha)A quick review:Because while it's amazing, this novel is also *detailed* and has a lot of world building. //Set in 2059, Scion London has separated humans into Amaurotics (normal humans) and Clairvoyants (those with gifts). This separation has caused Clairvoyants to be outcasts, so in order to survive Paige Mahoney works for Jaxon Hall, a criminal Mime Lord and leader of the Seven Dials. Paige is a "Dreamwalker", a rare and and she uses her ability to break into minds. Until one day, she is found by Scion and caught. Taken to live in Sheol 1 where Clairvoyants are under the control of Rephaim (a new race that has come to Earth), Paige must find a way back to her life and the Seven Dials.
