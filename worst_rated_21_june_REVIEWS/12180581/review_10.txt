*Sigh*So I went into this with low expectations. I had heard that the books were riddled with typos, so on and etc. But I made the argument to myself that most people do. "It's only $0.99."What I liked... 1. good pacing. The books have a zip-zip pace to them, and I think that's what draws a lot of people in. 2. There is a sense of playfulness. What I didn't like. 1. Trolls... treillings, whatever you call them. Just, really? I just couldn't get beyond the image in my head from a Merlin episode where a troll posing as a queen seduces Uther and spends most of the episode eating rotten produce. Just ew. And there wasn't really an effort made (besides the snooty name change offered by the troll-mom) to adjust the reader.2. The typos. But meh, not the end of the world.3. The total inconsistency of the plot. The human brother is real the heroine. And the mom trying to kill the troll daughter... um, in a different story it would be completely justifiable and she would be the protagonist. Like, you have to suspend a great deal of brain power to be like "okay, losing your son wouldn't make you crazy..." because I think it would.4. The reason for the switching... is disgusting. For money? Really? REALLY? That's the only reason. At the cost of a human child being separated from their family... I couldn't get over that. Finally, a lot of this would be justifiable if the writing was more complex or had just "a bit more." But I think these books are representative of works too quickly written. Sigh, I wanted to like these more, but I can't recommend that anyone else read them when compared to the whole slew of books on the market that are bettered edited and written with more care. Overall, I'd give this book more like a 1.5, but I have zero desire to read the rest.
