I’ve never read something by her I haven’t enjoyed immensely, even her blog posts! Her ability to create something so fun, yet thrilling in its own way is unique. I cannot wait to see where she goes in life, because I’m sure that her recent surge in popularity is not temporary.Wendy is a strong-willed girl, and reading Switched from her perspective was a joy. She is in a tough position, but she doesn’t budge when it comes to what she believes in, and I appreciate that. The other characters are completely enjoyable, and I loved them, and their interactions with each other.The Princess Diaries meets Tithe in Switched, the highly imaginative, immensely enjoyable novel from Amanda Hocking, an up-and-coming talent. I have nothing but love for Switched, and cannot wait to continue the story with Torn.
