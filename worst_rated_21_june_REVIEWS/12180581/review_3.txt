Picture this - a great life with a loving family,( with the exception of your mother trying to kill you when you were 5). and you're a total brat. all through out this book, i could picture Wendy whining and using her little gift of persuasion *sarcastic ooooh and ahhh* to get her way. It was her own fault for not having friends and being miserable because she never freaking tried. Its a two way street honey. You're not THAT beautiful. speaking of which i was so fucking tired of her constantly getting compliments. It seemed so fake and gag-worthy. ALSO, it was one of those stupid love stories. They know each other for about TWO WEEKS, and I'm led to believe the attraction is only physical, and i quote: "my hands were trembling, and that familiar butterfly feeling Finn gave me spread throughout my body.(here comes the funny part) I was in love with him, and I wasn't going to give him up. Not for anything in this world or the next. "WHAT THE FUCKKKK. WHO ARE YOU!? who. are. you. to be proclaiming your love for someone after TWO WEEKS and you barely even know him past his "gorgeous" face. and lastly. Wendy... go home. literally. You're maybe upset for about a day or two before you forget all about the family that loved and cared for your ungrateful little ass. I mean really. and yes I know, her and Rhys run away, but she only leaves when Finn no longer works there and she cant get what she wants anymore.
