This was fun! I tend to get bored while reading epic fantasy, but that wasn’t the case with this one! The dialogue was well done, and I admire the unique storytelling method. I wouldn’t pick this up if you’re a fan of hard magic systems with clear rules, but if you like more wondrous magic (and dragons!) I would give it a try!
