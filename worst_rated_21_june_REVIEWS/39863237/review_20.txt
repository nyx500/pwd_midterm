DNF @ 150 pagesThe storytelling was tedious and made me want to bash my skull into a wall. It flip flopped back and forth between Khirin's story - in first person, at point B in the timeline; and Talon's story - in third person, talking about Khirin/Rook, at point A in the timeline. I think it would have been interesting if it had been done just a certain way, but this one sooo did not work for me. There were a lot of names and places being thrown around - names that sounded like my cat decided to galavant across my keyboard, might I add - with little to no explanation (except for the mind-numbing useless facts in the footnotes that did absolutely nothing for the readers' comprehension or story line, which I'll get to in a minute) and it made the world confusing and hard to follow. I do hope the final copy will have either a map or a glossary (or both, preferably).Which brings me to the utterly useless footnotes that made me want to rage quit after two chapters of reading them - I ended up skipping them altogether after a few chapters and I'm pretty sure I missed exactly nothing. There was "world building" in them on occasion, but it was irrelevant drivel that didn't add to the plot in any way, shape, or form. To further my point, here are some examples of said footnotes:The vane's eyes glowed.* (*footnote: One presumes not literally.)Most folks just assume it must be a diamond.* Hard as a diamond, anyway.* YES THAT'S TWO IN THE SAME FREAKING SENTENCE (*footnotes: It's not a diamond. /// *Harder.)Like I said: utterly. useless. I think maybe the author was going for a Nevernight-esque thing with the footnotes, but most definitely failed. If you're going to drag me out of the story, at least make it worth my while.
