Angsty orphan with his head in the clouds didn't get his happy story so he decides to destroy the world? Orphan with his name so conspicuously similar to Krillin's?And then even the blurb is so filled with bullshit that they go so far to compare the worldbuilding with Sanderson's and prose with that of Rothfuss' (which is basically like they compared her with Robin Hobb, modern Mary Shelley)?Give me a break.I see where this is going.GR, when you finish hyping this book out to heavens and beyond, and couple of years passes by and everyone forgets it - I will read it in peace.
