THIS WAS FREAKING AMAZING, Iâ€™m crying right now it was so beautiful ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜¢ðŸ’— Go read this!! ----The Kingdom of Back is SUCH a beautiful and enchanting read! I LOVED the magical world so much, and the combination with historical fiction made it an amazing and PERFECT read for me! The best thing about this book though was easily the writing. It was so enchanting and wonderful to read. Whenever I picked up the book, I was completely sucked into the world! Thinking back on it (I finished it almost a week ago), I still don't really have the words to describe how amazing this was!! I just loved it so much and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone to be honest! The fact that it's a historical fiction (mostly) combined with a magical world I feel like makes it more approachable to people who don't generally read fantasy maybe? Another important and impressive aspect of this book was definitely that we actually discovered the story of Nannerl! She is Wolfgang Mozart's sister and inspiration: she was every way the talented composer and piano player that he was. AND WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT! Especially the author's note made it even more special.. so if you read the book, definitely do not skip it! It made me cry again ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­ðŸ’•----Thank you so much Penguin Random House for sending me a copy of this book along with amazing goodies!! ðŸ˜­
