Star Rating: â€”> 4 StarsWhat a wonderful fairytale filled with all the ingredients to make a story an absolutely joyous adventure to read!This made me feel like I was a little girl again, in one corner of the house or another, reading in the sunlight. Truly a beautifully and elegantly woven tale, about Nannerl Mozart, the brilliant sister that time almost left forgotten, & her brother Wolfgang, their secret kingdom, music, faeries, magic, & most of all, love.ðŸ’™
