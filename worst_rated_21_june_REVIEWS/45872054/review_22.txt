I received this complimentary ARC from the publisher, in exchange for an honest review."I wrote this book for the Nannerls of today and tomorrow, in the hopes that when they are ready to share their brilliance of the world, the world will be ready to give them the attention and honour that they deserve."I love the message behind this book, but I didn't love the book itself. I enjoyed the side quests that took place in the Kingdom of Back most of all, but I do think that the inclusion of the fantasy aspects of the book took away from the story. In my opinion, it should've remained a historical novel, rather than making it magical realism. I do empathise with Nannerl's story though, and the stories of all the other women in history whose achievements have been overlooked because the world of men weren't ready to acknowledge their genius and success. I just wish it had been executed better here. Marie Lu's lyrical writing style was on point as always, but some of the elements just didn't work in this book.I can't wait to read her next release, Skyhunter, though! :D
