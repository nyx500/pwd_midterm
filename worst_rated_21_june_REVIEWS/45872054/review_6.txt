UPDATE: $2.99 on kindle US today 10/1/29This came in my March Owlcrate. Pretty silver, shimery edges. And candle, socks, notecard, Art, lip balm, etc. Omg! I had no idea Mozart had a sister that was just as talented, but held back for being a girl. Girls weren’t allowed to compose!! Marie talks about this in her acknowledgments so read that as well. She’s added some fantasy to the world with a bit of truth. I’m thoroughly impressed and enjoyed the book! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
