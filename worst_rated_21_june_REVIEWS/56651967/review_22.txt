2.5 starsThis book was so disappointing. It was like it used all of the popular fantasy components and couldn't make a plot out of it. The heroine has to marry this vampire king and is told to kill him. But she can't. They hate each other, but they have an insta-love relationship and there are so many things that start and are never fleshed out. The hunting? What was that??? There was no point whatsoever. It just happens to add some steam and more pages to the book. The plot really doesn't start moving until the last 50 pages when all of the action actually happens. Then all of these secrets are revealed and that's it. I felt no real connection to the characters and their romance, probably because they spent a majority of the book just sleeping together and not really having a serious connection. All of the characters felt very surface level and I didn't really connect with any of them. This had so much potential but didn't actually flesh out in execution.
