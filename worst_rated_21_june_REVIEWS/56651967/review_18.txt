3.5⭐️I think this was pretty solid. I haven’t read all of St. Clair's books, but her writing is one I would recognize. I liked this writing way better than in the Hades and Persephone series but I still didn’t love the writing in this one. The characters were weird and problematic, just the way most of us like them. There was a passion in Isolde that I felt throughout the book whereas Adrian gave me more of a calm vibe. Usually, I will immediately call out insta love, but after some twists and reveals, a lot of things definitely made sense. The twists and reveals were actually some of my favorite parts of the story. The world-building was pretty cool and added to my overall interest in the book. I mean most worlds filled with vampires and other creatures are not usually that hard to fascinate me. The jealousy parts have got to go! They are incredibly cringey.Most of the fun happens at the end but the anticipation for all of it was on point. I currently have no immediate interest to read the next book. I would still recommend.
