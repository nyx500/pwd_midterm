I read the first chapter of Gilded Wolves and was like "ok, I need to clear like 2 days because once I start this, I won't be able to put it down." AND SO IT WAS. Roshani perfectly balances the stories of Severin, Laila, Zofia, Enrique and Tristan, taking us on an unrelenting adventure through and alternative Paris filled with magic and intrigue and power-hungry families. And the descriptions of food! And clothes! The fight scenes! The romance! I felt like I was living in this world, and am sort of grumpy that I'm not, to be honest. One thing that stood out to me was the originality of the characters within their own identities--as marginalized characters who are dealing with issues that marginalized characters *would* deal with in real life--but in a historical fantasy. It's not often that you see that, and Roshani handles it beautifully, particularly as concerns Enrique and his half-Spanish, half-Filipino heritage. His longing to be part of a full-blooded Filipino group is explored with great skill. And now...the wait for Book 2. Urgh. Write faster, Roshani, write faster!
