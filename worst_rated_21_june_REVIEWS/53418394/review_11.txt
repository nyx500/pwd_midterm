this read more like a beauty and the beast retelling than it did little red riding hood, it had its similarities to little red riding hood but the whole “being sent away to live with a beast who doesn’t like people but ends up falling for you” thing is pretty much this entire book. i liked the book in the first few pages but once she went to go live with the wolf i was a bit bored. i also found their relationship a bit boring as well. i really wished i liked it more but i’ll definitely will be reading the sequel.
