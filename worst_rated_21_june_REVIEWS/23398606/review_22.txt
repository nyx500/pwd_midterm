I wavered in my rating. I think the author completely missed her niche with this. The book is full of gore. Violence and bloodshed , cannibalism-it’s all there. But what is introduced and barely touched upon is the sex. We are told the various male offenders (the Walrus, the Rabbit, etc) kidnap and rape young women, often entrapping them and maiming them. But NONE of that is described. Why? The fighting and killing is detailed. This series could have pushed an erotic envelope. As it is it reaches a YA audience who may have an Alice fetish. So what? Don’t get me wrong the “many years later” is always an interesting premise and being stuck in a looney bin while underworld bosses wreak havoc in the Old City having assaulted the eponymous character when she was a child is almost daring. I’ve added book two of the series to my Audible wish list to see where this goes.
