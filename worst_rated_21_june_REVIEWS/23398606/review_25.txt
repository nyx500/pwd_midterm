Not Alice in Wonderland as we know it, but a very dark retelling of that favourite tale. Alice has followed her friend Dor down the rabbit hole into the lawless Old City where violence and misogyny rule. After attending a strange tea party she is raped by a man she calls the Rabbit, whose eye she stabs in her escape. Found babbling and bleeding she is locked away in an insane asylum until she escapes in a fire with her neighbouring inmate, the axe wielding Hatcher. Together they go in search of the Rabbit, meeting some memorably horrible creatures on the way.Definitely not a tale for the faint-hearted, with plenty of blood and gore, rape and even cannibalism. All the men are depicted as rapists and women are far from safe so this rabbit hole is a pretty horrendous nightmarish place. However, despite all that I enjoyed it very much perhaps because Alice is a very resourceful woman who is kind and compassionate and this is also very imaginative tale with a touch of magic, a good infusion of humour and even a little of romance.
