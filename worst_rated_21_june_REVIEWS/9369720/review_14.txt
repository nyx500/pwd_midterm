THANK YOU GOD, I FINISHED IT!!!This book sucks terribly.Fallen and Torment were both really good books and I found the series got a little boring, predictable and disappointing.Everything in this book got so confusing:1. It has no plot at all!2. Time traveling was literally so confusing.3. Luce is dumbass: what on earth is she searching for?4. How does Daniel keep changing his appearance in almost each past life? He´s immortal after all. He doesn´t die!5. Why do all the other fallen angels always hang around Daniel and Luce in each life? 6. All the characters are doing nothing except wandering from one era to other.7. My biggest disappointment (both with this book and the last) was the lack of Cam.Passion was 420 pages of torture . I don't know anything more about Luce and Daniel than I did in the last book.
