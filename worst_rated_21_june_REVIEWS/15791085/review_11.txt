Oh. My. God.I don't know what to say. Other than this has to be my favorite young adult paranormal/fantasy/whatever they are calling it so far this year. And that's saying something because I'm not a huge fan of fae books other than the Iron Fey series and this book is NOTHING like that. It kind of reminds me of the Fever series, but for young adult. It's nothing like that plot or what not, but it has that hard edge, ya know. This book is so different it terms of what's out there in the YA market. I loved the historical aspect and while I don't read a lot of steampunk, it didn't bother me at all in this story, b/c I don't think the steampunk overshadowed the story at all. Besides the bloody awesome fight scenes, if you guys know me, I'm all about the romance and the romance in this book is one of my favorite kinds. I don't want to get too spoiler, but if you know what I like and what I write, then you probably know what I'm talking about. Oh, Kiaran. Anyway, I'm rambling. Buy this book when it comes out. I think it's out in the UK and the end of this month and then in the US May 2014.
