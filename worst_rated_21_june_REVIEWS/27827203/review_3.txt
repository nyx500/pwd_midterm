*I've lowered my rating to a 4, more towards a 3.5 upon further thought*4.5*First off I'm super excited because this author lives in my town which does not happen often!But I ended up enjoying this a lot more than I had thought I would! I think I found the cover off putting (mine is an ARC and has a different cover than that pictured)I loved the world divided by binaries and watching those binaries blur. It was a really cool read!P.S. A video review will be going up closer to the publication date!*Received ARC from Indigo Books and Music, many thanks to them!!!*
