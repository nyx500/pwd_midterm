This is an awesome debut novel. It is excellent by any novels standards. I was recommended this as I really liked the Throne of Glass and the story the story telling is right on par with this great series. If you grew up with fairytales and love superheroes, you would love this story.Ruby is a Fireblood (meaning she can generate frie) in a land ruled by Frostbloods (the ability to generate ice), this is more that enough to get her killed. Thought the basics of her power by her grandmother, she is hidden away by her mother. However, when her secret is discovered and costs her everything she holds dear, she is burning for one thing revenge. When an opportunity is presented to her, she is dubious about trusting her natural enemies as allies.This story has it all, well written, well paced, action, romance, and even great character development. I like the fact that the characters' natural personalities match their powers. Ruby is fire so hot tempered, where as Frostbloods are portrayed is emotionally cold as they are powerful. However, the characters are not one dimensional. they all develop through the story. Ruby is constantly second-guessing herself, but when she makes a decision, she is determined to see it through no matter the cost to herself. I really enjoyed this book, and I can't wait for the next one.
