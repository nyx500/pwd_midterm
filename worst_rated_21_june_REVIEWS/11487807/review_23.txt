Positively magnificent! This is one of the best fantasy novels I’ve read in some time. The setting is the great city of Dhamsawaat, capital of the Crescent Moon Kingdoms. This is glorious fantasy by way of the Arabian Nights. Dr. Adoulla Mahkslood is a ghul hunter, among the last of a dying breed. He’s growing tired of hunting monsters and saving lives. Retirement is starting to sound attractive. But when a young boy is brought to him, a boy whose parents have been slain by ghuls, and whose aunt is the only woman Adoulla has ever loved, he agrees to help.Raseed bas Raseed is a holy warrior, a dervish, and assistant to the Doctor in his work. He’s a stickler for rules and tradition and the perfect foil for the more easygoing ghul hunter.Zamia Badawi is Protector of the Band, the only female ever to hold that title in her nomadic tribe. She can take the shape of a lion, which makes her a formidable warrior. When members of her tribe are slaughtered, including her own father, she swears vengeance upon his killer, and soon realizes that the Doctor and Raseed are hunting the same foe.There are a few other viewpoint characters, but this book's delights are best appreciated by reading it for oneself. If, like me, you grow weary of the endless stream of swords and dragons and European castles that typify so much of fantasy writing, this is the book for you. Walter Jon Williams, in a quote on the back cover, compares it to the stories of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. It's an apt comparison. As in Fritz Lieber’s tales, there are fully realized characters and a strong sense of location, and magic, while powerful, is never easy, and comes at a price.Inside the front cover is the usual map, but most of the locations outside of Dhamsawaat itself are merely referred to, not seen. I look forward to seeing them in subsequent books, which I’m confident will be every bit as memorable as this one. Recommended!
