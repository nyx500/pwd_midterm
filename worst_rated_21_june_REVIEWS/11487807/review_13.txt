I'm kind of surprised this traditional fantasy novel was shortlisted for the Hugo, not because it isn't good, but because it is traditional fantasy. That being said, the flow of the novel was top rate and a quick read, truly giving us a feel of the Arabian Nights universe while focusing mostly on great action, great characterization, and a solid plot. As a piece of writing, it is better than most fantasy I've ever read, but it might not stay in my mind because it didn't challenge me. It might challenge anyone who hasn't read the Arabian Nights or anything with an Arab-centric viewpoint, but honestly, that was probably the most beautiful part of the whole tale. It is certainly a welcome respite from cookie-cutter fantasy plots. I am giving it a well-deserved 5 stars!
