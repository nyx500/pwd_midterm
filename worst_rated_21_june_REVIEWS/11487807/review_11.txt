Middle Eastern fantasy, with djenns and ghuls and dervishes and all sorts of Sinbad-type fun. It's mostly the adventures of a fat old ghul-hunter and his serious young companion plus their companions, including a young tribeswoman who turns into a lion. Surprisingly horrific at points--the baddie really is evil and the bits where we see him at work torturing an unfortunate chap are quite hard to read, and rather against the high-body-count action-movie feel of the rest of the book. It's vividly imagined and very atmospheric and the plot rattles along well, underpinned by some real emotion and moral dilemmas. I slightly felt it needed another editorial pass, particularly in the latter stages. It's extremely common, particularly in SFF, to read the first three chapters, marvel at the polish, and then by sixty percent you can see that the later text hasn't been gone over at anything like the same level. It always annoys me--the opening sells this book, but the ending sells the next book, so it's a bit self defeating from publishers. Notwithstanding, it's fabulous to have any fantasy that isn't Eurocentric, and this is a lovely addition to my small but growing shelves of those. A good read though I enjoyed Engraved on the Eye more, simply because all the stories were polished to the level of which the author is clearly capable. Keen to see what else he's got.
