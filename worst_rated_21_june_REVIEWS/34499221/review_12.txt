remember when i said this book was good?? well it is, but you know what, the more i think about it, the more i've realized that the ending was anticlimatic as fuck and Lira and Elian's relationship can choke on balls the size of my pEn!!!!i guess i really hyped this up and ended up giving it 4 stars in a rush because i was really enjoying it in the moment, but once the ending came and i actually used my brain to think about it, i was like hMmMmMmMmmmm NO THIS IS KIND OF A PIECE OF SHIT!!!!LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S ENJOYABLE!!!!first off, this has such an interesting plot. a killer siren princess who rips the hearts out of princey boys to represent her age(??). but then little ruthless Lira fucked up and abusive piece of shit mommy got really mad and turned her into a! human! and that's like,,, very humiliating in the siren world, and on the land, our prince/pirate boy Elian kills sirens. one day on his ship, he sees a woman floating in the sea and decides to help her. le shock, it issa me, mArIo is Lira!!!! and that's how killer siren/human hybrid babies are made. and so she decides to help him on his quest and whatever!!!what i love so much about these two characters is how they always have a witty comeback prepared for anything the other person says and it's like an indirect challenge to leave the other person speechless by roasting tf out of them. THAT IS THE TYPE OF CONTENT I NEVER KNEW I WANTED. and i got it from lira and elian sjkfbqdw. they're so fucking funnyyy!!! and lira being clueless about many everyday human things added on to the comedic aspect. i genuinely found myself laughing.also, elian's crew is GOALS AF. they're funny, strong, loyal, loving and so protective towards each other. they always got each others backs their friendships are just so pure and wholesome!!!THE FEMALE CHARACTERS BLEW ME AWAY WITH DAT BADASSERY !! the princess, the girl on elian's crew and lira and some of the other woman are so fucking brutal and badass, someone pick me up because holy shit, it was fine af also, there's a lot of death, and brutal murdering, it's great, you should read it! :)NOW ON TO SHIT I FUCKING DESPISE:something about the writing and world building felt very lacking and monotonous. the action scenes also, felt really not as intense as they should have been. like, the writing is just MONOTONOUS !!L I R A A N D E L I A N SITTING IN A TREE, NO K I S S I N G BECAUSE THEIR RELATIONSHIP SUCKED ASS AND THEY WERE BETTER OFF AS FRIENDS. THEY WERE DOING SO WELL AND THEN YA HAD TO GO OFF AND MAKE IT A SHIT ROMANCE SLKWQDKSBVDSKLAVA, NO.FUCKTHEM.ALSO WHAT THE FRICKITY FRACK WAS THAT ANTICLIMATIC ENDING. EVERYTHING GOT RESOLVED SO EASILY AND THEN IT'S JUST A HAPPILY EVER AFTER, UM NO, BITVH. WHAT THE FUCK[rage quits and dies]buddy read with my girl Yusra
