3.7/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Technically, I’m a murderer, but I like to think that’s one of my better qualities.” This is a very hyped up book. You all know it. You all did it. Everyone is reading it and I just couldn't resist. Fantasy is not the genre I prefer but a book about mythology and sirens and pirates is right up my alley. I truly enjoyed this book, it was a very strong debut novel, but it contained its faults.Princess Lira is siren royalty and the most lethal of them all. With the hearts of seventeen princes in her collection, she is revered across the sea. Until a twist of fate forces her to kill one of her own. To punish her daughter, the Sea Queen transforms Lira into the one thing they loathe most--a human. Robbed of her song, Lira has until the winter solstice to deliver Prince Elian's heart to the Sea Queen or remain a human forever. The ocean is the only place Prince Elian calls home, even though he is heir to the most powerful kingdom in the world. Hunting sirens is more than an unsavory hobby--it's his calling. When he rescues a drowning woman in the ocean, she's more than what she appears. She promises to help him find the key to destroying all of sirenkind for good--But can he trust her? And just how many deals will Elian have to barter to eliminate mankind's greatest enemy?As I promised to some of you, I will rant about the use of my native language, Greek, in this book.  Psariin=🐠 , the language of the sirens is basically Greek. When I started reading this book and read the first Greek word, I was pretty fucking excited. Greek isn't often mentioned in books as far as I'm concerned, though it is mentioned more in film and television. When Greek is used incorrectly in film and television, we don't take it seriously. We have made memes out of badly used Greek in film and television. I'm serious. (Γεια σου κ��λημέρα, γεια σου καληνύχτα, γεια σου καληνότσες.) But it's different in literature. Literature is serious, mistakes like these I'm about to tell you shouldn't exist. They should have consulted a Greek person about it, it wouldn't be so hard. Even an 8 year old could find the mistakes in these. But I will start with the correct usage of my language. Here are some of the kingdoms with Greek names and their translations in English:Adekaros = PennilessDiavolos = HellArmonia = HarmonyPagos = IceKleftes = ThievesKalokairi = Summer (ΟΛΑ ΜΟΙΑΖΟΥΝ ΚΑΛΟΚΑΙΡΙ)Eidyllio = RomanceAgrios = RoughPolemistes = WarriorsKardia = HeartGlossa = Language (Αυτή είναι η φάση, δεν είναι αυτή η φάση. Σνιφ)Psemata = Lies (ΕΙΠΕΣ ΠΩΣ ΜΕ ΘΕΣ ΨΕΜΑΤΑ)Efevresi = InventionThese are some of the 100 kingdoms mentioned and described in the book. I will give it to them on that, the descriptions of the kingdoms matched their words amazingly and a translation wasn't particularly needed. Although, it should have been added, anyone could understand what each kingdom was about. The way the words were spelled though was incorrect... a Greek person can pronounce them easily but I doubt someone who doesn't speak Greek at all, can. But let's let this pass.Let's go now to the correct usage of some words and phrases in Greek:p. 35  Dolofonos = Murderer, Choiron = Pig (it's a lighter version of pig, like penis is to dick, for example)p. 103 Aidiastiko gourouni = Disgusting pigp. 105 Parakalo = Please (here in Greece we never beg with only parakalo, we say se or sas parakalo, but I will let it slide)p. 190 Porni mou= My whore (this is so funny in Greek, I was laughing my ass off for 2 hours)p. 307 Tha pethanete = You will all dieWell, nothing to say here. These were correct, not their spelling exactly, but they were correct. Some of these had translations, some of them didn't. I think they all should have been translated. Moving on to my favorite part. The butchering of my language. Here I am, reading my book in silence, minding my own business etc.etc. And then comes the dreaded page 104. This is where the magic happened, not in Diavolos Sea. This is where the memes started happening, this is where I started sending these funny af sentences to my friends. Let's go to the paradise:p. 104 Aschimi ligo skyla. It is supposed to be translated to "filthy little bitch". If you're not Greek, you won't understand how funny this is. It's like saying "filthy a bit bitch" or something. The correct one is "aschimi mikri skyla". We don't really say that here, but it's the right translation.p. 104 Tha sas skotoso ton eafto mou. It's like she's saying "I will kill myself". It's so wrong, I can't even look at it. The correct one would be "tha sas skotoso" = I will kill you myselfp. 105 Prinkipissa. It's Prigkipissa which means "Princess".p. 111 Pote den tha. It was supposed to say "I would never" but we don't cut it that way here like in English. It's "pote den tha to ekana".p. 112 Ego den tha sas prodosei. She's saying "I won't betray you", but the right usage is "ego den tha sas prodoso".p. 191 Anthropinos. It says "human" but the word "anthropinos" is the adjective. "Anthropos" is the noun. p. 308 Ilthia anoitos. It's supposed to say "stupid fool" but in Greek it's redundant to use both. So just only say "ilithia" or only "anoiti".p. 312 Anoitos. Its translation is "fool" and the right usage is "anoite". p. 312 Parte ton apo ton. Guys, I'm fucking serious, I have no idea what this is supposed to say. It doesn't make any fucking sense! Anyone who knows, comment down below.I find these mistakes inexcusable and sloppy. This is Google Translate guys. It's fucking Google Translate. If I go to Google Translate right now and search these, these will be the results. Psariin is the language of the protagonist's people, it's so important in the plot, it's a huge part of the book and it was slaughtered this way. I'm very disappointed. I was so excited to see my language written inside a novel and they did me like this. After a certain point, I couldn't take it seriously. I was just laughing. I'm not an expert on linguistics or anything and there were also some other mistakes I can't explain in English. I also don't know if I forgot some part from the book, I'm sorry about that. Anyone who wants to correct me on anything, feel free. *don't mind the Greek sentences, just some memes and inside jokes for my Greek friends in here to enjoy 😉 Now let's go down to the actual book. Let's start with the writing. ✍️ I adored her writing, She pictured vivid images of the worlds, the dialogue was on point, the characters lovable. The world she created was very rich and beautiful. I loved the mythology, the creatures, the kingdoms. They were all fascinating to me. The politics not so much. But politics always bore me.Second of all, let's talk about the romance. I loved Lira and Elian. They were both amazing characters. Anti-heros who were so alike and yet so different. I think the romance happened a bit fast. I felt like after Elian came back for her, it was instant. It wasn't that obvious and it didn't bother me, but it was there. I shipped it though. I truly did.I will talk about the pace of the book a bit. I felt like certain parts that needed more pages were rushed and the opposite. I felt like the book didn't have the best balance. And also I would like to say something about the other characters, except Elian and Lira. While I loved these two characters with a passion, I don't think the author succeeded as much to make the other characters memorable. They were all lovable, but they were just there for me. Like they only served the purpose of being Elian's true family and they weren't something by themselves. It might be only me, but I don't think I will remember these characters after a while.To sum it all up, this was a thrilling debut. With many mistakes and faults, but the story was enthralling. I will remember it for a long time (mostly because of the Greek lol) but after I remember the butchered Greek, I will remember this beautiful story. So... till the next one K BYE!
