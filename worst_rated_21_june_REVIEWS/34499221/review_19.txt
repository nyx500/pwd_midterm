“His face makes no difference.” I drop her hand. “It’s his heart I’m after.”“So many hearts.” Her voice is angelic. “You’ll soon run out of room to bury them all.”I lick my lips. “Maybe,” I say. “But a princess must have her prince.”This book is so unique and fun to read.SIRENS 🧜‍♀️ and PIRATES, just how freaking awesome is that?!? I have an unhealthy obsession with sirens and pirates 🤪Lira and Elian are awesome, funny, sarcastic, intelligent and badass. I love the dynamic that they have and the relationship development was fantastic.“We are not naïve little heirs to be molded as they wish. We are warriors. We are rulers”The villain of the story was great and real and really after all a freaking villain to the core!!!“She is a performer as much as she is a queen.”The side characters are amazing and the friendships are so funny.And how they didn’t try to justify every bad thing they did and they forgive each other is just life💘.The writing, literally everything was just on point in this one!! I had all of my questions answered, and for a single book, a lot happened and all made bloody sense. Which may be hard to find in a standalone. One scene in particular that I can’t really say (spoiler) just made me so happy 😍😁. I was smiling so hard. It was just an entertaining read!!“I smile at that, because Elian of all people should know better. He should know to have more faith in myth and fairy tale”BR with Ronak(Pihu) Gajjar💕.
