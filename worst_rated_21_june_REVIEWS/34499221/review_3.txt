4.5 stars for a simple yet solid standalone fantasy YA. I devoured this book so quickly and it's the first time I loved reading the enemies-to-lovers trope, because the main characters, their development, their inner fears, and their banter with each other were all done so naturally well. Both protagonists were truly lethal that I wanted to fly through the book just to see how they could possibly even like each other. It’s also fun to see all the different places they went to and how the kingdoms differ from one another; the world building is easy to digest without bogging you down with overcomplicated description and extraneous information. I’m on the fence between giving this 4 or 5 stars because I truly enjoyed reading the characters and their snappy dialogue and I wouldn’t change much else. Really the only nitpick I have is that although the first and last 1/3 of the book is exciting and intriguing, I found the middle portion to be a little meandering, and it was almost too easy to see the characters go from Point A to Point B in their adventure. If we’re going to take this time following the characters in such a linear way, I would’ve liked to see more of the romantic development in order to build up the angst and tension later on. Still, this is pretty much on par with An Enchantment of Ravens as a solid standalone fantasy with good romance to root for.
