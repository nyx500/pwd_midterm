A pirate prince who wears eyeliner O H M Y G O O D N E S S...#sorrynotsorry.In all seriousness To Kill a Kingdom is brilliant. Yes it does feel like a debut at times but THAT is what forced me appreciate all the others aspects of this book. It was dark (i like), it was funny (i love), it was enemies to lovers (my heart), it has bromance (kill me now), it has amazing banter (gah!), it has a whole pirate crew (*dreamy sighs*), it has sirens (seriously) and it has Elian (my husband) who is also a pirate prince.Honestly i am impressed by the way the author handled their relationship it was s l o w b u r n - it was believable, it was fast-paced and most importantly the author makes you root for them. Some one in the heavens must have been busy because damn the banter in this book is so witty and their were so many clever puns. There is so much sass my shipper heart felt so happy.Elian says. “When I marry, it won’t be about power.”“What will it be, then?”“Sacrifice.”“You’re right,” I tell him, trying to shake the melancholy from my voice. “Spending a lifetime with you would be a sacrifice.”“Oh?...What would you be losing?” he asks.“If I married you?” I stand to tower above him, pushing away the unraveling thing inside me. “I suppose it would be my mind.”This is true love guys. If that doesn't capture your attention here is another one:“How strange that instead of taking his heart, I'm hoping he takes mine.”...yeah.Anyways, I absolutely LOVED the world-building. gah! This book is action packed. It's fast paced. It's a standalone fantasy and it lives up to the hype! I am so happy i picked it up. And can we please have more pirate princes who wear eyeliners in YA fantasy?
