This was a weird one for me, being one of the few books in my life (barring exceptional circumstances) that took me over 4 months to finish. I re-checked it out from the library at least 6 times.The story itself was interesting enough that I wanted to see how it ended. And while I was actually doing the reading I did enjoy myself. But every time I put it down, picking it back up again just seemed like a huge burden. There is SO much description in this book. I think maybe 90% of it is told in passive voice by the narrator explaining how things are. Dialogue and action make up the other 10%. This is not necessarily bad; the world being described is quite fascinating, and all the tiny details that get relayed do add up to a magical place that I'd love to visit. And McKinley's writing is very nice. But it did make it feel as though I was listening to an educational lecture rather than an exciting fantasy adventure. As in her other books, McKinley here excels at depicting friendships between humans and animals. I love the personalities she writes for her dogs, cats, horses, and sundry woodland critters. I also like the relationships she writes between characters, particularly between female characters. For a fairy tale to centre the love of friends and family rather than romantic love is always so refreshing.Overall I'm glad I persevered, but I'm equally glad that it is over.
