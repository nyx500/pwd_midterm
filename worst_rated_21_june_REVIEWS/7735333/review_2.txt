that feeling when you enjoy a book, go and check out other reviews, see it has a friend average of 2.99, and then you silently question everything about your life. ðŸ˜‚i dont know what to say other then i liked this. i thought it was fresh, original, and entertaining. i thought the plot was cool, i found myself caring about the characters, and im looking forward to the next book. my entertainment standards must be pretty low. lol. â†  4 stars
