[This in no way is to offend the author, it's just a personal opinion and if I offended anybody please let me know!üç©]I- I didn't even finish it. Um...But I didn't like the 90 pages I read, so I'll be a judgmental witch and give it one star. And add a lot of tags. Because that's what a good, trusting, and loving individual does. When you find that person, hit me up if you will. Okay, so, I've given it a lot of thought and have decided NOT to reread this. Why? Because I poured all the acid I needed to cleanse my eyes with, down with the Stuck With You review. I shall not make myself suffer again. dang it, I want to read it so badly thoughFrom what I remember (which again, is not that much) there was a girl. And there was a guy. And both annoyed me so utterly much that I *clears throat* Well, I... I decided not to pursue this novel's path to self-destruction.Perhaps I'm being overly prejudiced and biased, but as I'm not willing I actually am, but I'm trying to contain myself from waltzing into a whole butt load of painful QuIRkInEsS to read this again, I'm afraid any and all rants must be confined to this space of mine. The space we call:~Why In The Bloody Heck Was I Thinking~See, I have a lot of books in that section of my brain. Books I should NOT be thinking of reading just to rant about them. So, *organizes flashcards*, I shall abstain myself from that certain decision. apart from the fact that this is a series and if I WERE to read this and not like it, I'll make myself read the rest of the series thus, creating a line straight to Book HadesI apologize to all those who loved it because surely, there was something good about the story. Something I didn't get to watch unfold. *takes off eyeglasses* That is all, fellow Jury.I shall take my leave now.
