I actually quite enjoyed this book.Not because it was a great book per say, but more because it was a very fast and easy read. I did reach page 167 in just a couple of hours.But even tho I enjoyed it, I don't know if I'm intrested enough to keep going with this series.I've heard that the second book is not worth reading since nothing really happens in it, so I did plan to skip it and just read some spoilery review for it but I also don't know feel like picking up the last book in the series.I just don't care enough about the characters and the situation to invest time in it. Even more so because I have a huge TBR that I do actually want to read.There wasn't anything that really bugged me about this book and I don't know why it get's so much hate, but personaly... I'm just not invested enough.Cassia lives in a society where everything is already chosen for her. From the food that she eats to the cloths she wears, everybody has a programm to follow and no one dares to disobey.People are led to belive that everything that happens is for the best.• The food they give them is personal picked for each and everyone of them to keep them strong and energized without them gaining any excess weight.• They are monitored when they exercise, so they don't over work themselves.• They all wear the same clothes and have to obey to the same rules which mostly are not to disturb other citizens.• They are all sorted into jobs from a young age based on their abilities.to name a few. But perhaps most importantly,• When they reach 17 they go to a banquet where they are "Matched" with another person of a different gender based on their statistics, whom they supposed to marry one day.
