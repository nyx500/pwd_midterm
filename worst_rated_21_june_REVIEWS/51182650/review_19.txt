This was fun! I didn't have super high expectations going in because YA fantasy isn't typically my favorite genre, but this was pretty fun to read. It wasn't a perfect story, and I do think that A LOT of the conflicts had very convenient and easy solutions, but overall this was a fun time and I'm happy that I spent the last few days in between these pages. I did end up listening to this one as an audiobook while reading along in the physical book and I think that added to the experience for me. I liked the narrator and listening to this really made it feel more like getting told a fairy tale and I am not mad about it. Definitely recommend if you want to read a fairy tale-esque queer fantasy!
