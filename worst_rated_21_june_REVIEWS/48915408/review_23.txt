2.5 stars I really need to pay closer attention to trigger warnings. And I read them, I did! But when everyone was saying this book was brutal I didn’t listen for some reason? And yeah, this book was too brutal/gory for my liking. Just a little bit too much where I’d put this book more under horror than fantasy but that might just be my feelings about it. The Wolf and the Woodsman is the story of Evike, a young woman with no magic who is betrayed by her village and sent off to be a sacrificial magic wolf girl for the king. While with a group of Woodsman, they are attacked by creatures in the forest and Evik finds herself one of the survivors along with Gaspar, a one eyed woodsman who turns out to be a disgraced prince. Together they must survive the creatures of the forest despite disliking each other. I thought this book dragged. I wasn’t a huge fan of the writing style and while I found some of the story to be interesting, the pacing was really off. I would get into one part of the story and then they were off doing something completely different or retelling a myth in the middle of the book. I’m not sure what to pin point, but I really didn’t connect with this book. I read it all the way to the end so I did have some enjoyment of it but probably wouldn’t read more by this author unless I knew the books were different.
