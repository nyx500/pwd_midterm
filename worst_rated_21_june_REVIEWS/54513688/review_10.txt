The magic of the Spindles is interesting, and this story is full of action and political intrigue. The writing is great, and the plot is full of twists and betrayal, on top of that we have knights, assassins, immortal beings, and monsters.“You are a realm breaker, Taristan. You would crack this world apart and build an empire from its ruins.”The prologue introduces us to Cortael of Cor who is on a mission with some knights from Galland and some immortal warriors (called the Elders) to stop his twin brother who seeks power. Taristan of Cor plans to tear open the Spindles, some kinds of portals that allow people and creatures to travel from one world to another, and if he succeeds, the realm might very well get destroyed. But what happens when the hero fails to stop the villain? “Today, we fight for tomorrow.”Corayne An-Amarat, daughter of Cortael of Cor and a renowned pirate, is dragged into a quest to save the world by the immortal Domacridhan and the assassin Sorasa Sash. Together, they have to find the Spindleblade and stop Taristan from destroying the world. Corayne does not want to get dragged into politics and fighting, but she's always longed for adventure, and this is the only way to get away from her lonely life that consists of watching her mother coming and going and being left behind. Along the way, they team up with Andry Trellant the squire, Charlie Armont the King of ink and expert in fake documents, Valtik the crazy witch/seer, and Sigil the ruthless and fierce bounty hunter. I like how none of them particularly cared for the others at first, or even about the fate of the world, but they ended up working together for the greater good, and also because deep down inside they started to like each other.“So the realm stands on the brink of destruction. It might have tipped already. And for some reason, you need me to join this . . .” He glanced down their line. This time his scrutiny felt like an insult. “Merry band of heroes?”The characters are brave, ruthless, snarky, and full of wits. They are all so different, that you are almost sure to love at least one of them. I enjoyed the different POVs, but sadly this book as a whole failed to really grab my attention. The world-building is expansive, and I admit that it took me a while to read the prologue and the first few chapters because I kept trying to find the cities and countries they were talking about on the (gorgeous) map. It also took me a while to sort out all of the names and new words and to understand the working of the Spindles, and because of that, I struggled to be fully invested in the story for the first 100 pages or so. It does make sense after a while, and it is kinda worth it if you can push through. On the positive side, this adventure takes us across different lands and cities, and we really get to explore this new world. The lands of Allward are inspired by medieval Europe, Middle East, and North Africa. The kingdoms are diverse and each one has different cultures, climates, beliefs, and people. Another thing that I liked about this book is the main villain. Taristan is complex, and I am sad that we didn’t get to see more of him. I won't say too much because I don't want to spoil anyone, but he and his "love-interest" are a nice duo. They're both sizing each other up, both doing whatever the hell they want to do, and they both know that the other is untrustworthy, and I am curious about how their relationship wll develop.“A king of ashes is still a king.”Overall, Realm Breaker is really more a high-fantasy than a YA fantasy. It is well written, with a good mix of action, politics, funny moments, and great diverse characters, but it was not exactly the right book for me. I know many people loved it, but I was disappointed, and overall I found the book long, and I struggled to really care about the characters of their quest. I do not think that I will read the next book, which is sad because I usually really enjoye Aveyard's books.Seven against two hundred soldiers of Galland, a Spindle at their backs. Impossible, but then so was everything else up to this moment. We’ve overcome impossible before, Corayne told herself, trying to believe it, trying to be brave. For her mother somewhere, for her father dead. For her friends around her, and the realm threatening to collapse on them all.Fanarts by Marcellamac_artFollow me on Instagram 🙂
