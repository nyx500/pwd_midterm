I enjoyed this book a lot.My problem with it is that is hard to read, it has excessive amounts of unnecessary information, but the story and the connection between the characters is so strong and unconventional that is worth pushing through it.  The tension that the writer creates between Sunshine and Con is incredible, I just wished there had been more about their relationship; I want more about Sunshine and Con together!I definitely wish there was a sequel, in fact I can't believe there isn't! it's like a cruel joke, not funny at all.
