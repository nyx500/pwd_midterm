Help! I have fallen off the bandwagon.Oh dear, I really have. I usually ride shot-gun on the bandwagon and I really don't mind, I mean just look at my read shelf. I see all the 4 & 5 stars from friends & reviewers I follow for Crimson Bound and I am disappointed why I didn't like this more, as this is a 2.5 stars read for me. Crimson Bound didn't give me any feels whatsoever, unless meh is a feel. The plot was quite promising but the execution, doh', felt flat. Right round 75% when I realized that forest borns could just infiltrate basically everywhere, I just couldn't recover my waning interest because the plan to give the Devourer a body seemed convoluted after that. Given 3,000 years, they could've done a lot to scheme for the eventual return of their god, they could even...Plus why in the fuckity fuck would Erec D'Anjou have Rachelle guard Armand, when she's the worse person for the job because she hates the Devourer and the forest born's credo. Why let her guard the future body suit of the Devourer? Also, how goddamn stupid is the king to strike that deal with the forest borns? Three thousand years of being told that forestborns can't be trusted...I can't even...I liked Rachelle, she's tough and is complex enough to be interesting. I'll forgive her horniness because she's eighteen and D'Anjou is presumably smokin' hot, who is also an asshole who makes her feel inadequate. That's a lethal combination for some women. As for Armand, I gotta hand it to Rosamund Hodge (badumtssshhhh...) for writing a love interest with no hands. I like the novelty of that but that's it. Let's not get into the love triangle and insufficient build up before the L word got thrown around.Did I like anything at all? Yes, I liked the mythology about Zisa and Tyr, Joyeuse and Durendal. I thought that was smoothly carried out, but as a whole, Crimson Bound fell short for me.
