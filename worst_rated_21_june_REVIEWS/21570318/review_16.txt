This was a bit up-and-down for me. Some parts I found myself really engaged in the story and at other parts I was dreading continuing on. This story takes its roots in the tale of Little Red Riding Hood. Very loosely, which I enjoyed.The strengths of this book are similar to my favorite aspect of Rosamund Hodge's debut novel, Cruel Beauty. The conversations and personalities of the female characters are very alive. They are humorous and snarky and wicked. She doesn't water them down. Her writing is also very vibrant. The main character in this is Rachelle, essentially a half-human, half-demon, enslaved by an evil forest. I loved her bluntness and bravery. I found her irritating at times though. She was very self-deprecating and impulsive, which led to both annoying internal monologues and some questionable decisions. The plot follows Rachelle's adventures/ misadventures destroying the evil forest that possesses her and terrorizes the whole kingdom. The main love interest is a dude named Armand, essentially a prince of the kingdom. Honestly his name kept reminding me of:Dr. Armond from the Kroll Show.It was distracting at first. Especially since he was described as an average looking guy with a small body. He also has no hands, which was an interesting complexity to his character.The other main dude/ semi-love interest is a half-demon guy named Erec, who kept making me think of Eric from Trueblood.So I didn't actually mind that.Aaaaanyways, I enjoyed this and look forward to her next book (which is coming out this year!) :D
