I just can't get into this. The backstory of the world and some of the terms are just too confusing to me. It definitely hasn't helped that I started this right before my son was born and had to put it down for quite a while. When I picked it back up I was so lost. I've put it down and picked it back up 3 times now and tried both the print and audio formats but was never able to get invested. I feel like the section I read was very slow and repetitive and I don't really see the point of the story. I'm just no longer interested.The audiobook narrator (Elizabeth Knowelden) reads in a very soothing, beautiful voice and I did enjoy listening to her but I don't think audio format helped the details stick.I think this is a story that would benefit from being able to read it one shot.
