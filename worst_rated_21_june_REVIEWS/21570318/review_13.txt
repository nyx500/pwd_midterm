I really wanted this book to be good.Plot: had potential Love triangle: *gags*Heroine: likableLove interest(s): unbelievable, insta-loveish, and I ended up liking the wrong guy Writing: saving grace.Me: disappointed Everything just boils down to my inability connect to the story. The world building needed some fleshing out (things just got waaaayyyyy too convenient at one point), the romance was half-assed and lacked that spark (also *continues dry-heaving* love triangle), and the plot had so much potential it hurt. However, I was able to finish it, thanks to writing and the characters (which, themselves, are not unlikable). Sorry for the super crappy review.
