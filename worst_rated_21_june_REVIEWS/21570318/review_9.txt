I wrote a review but somehow it wasn’t saved on my word doc and since I can’t remember what I said I’ll write down my thoughts now, a week after reading it. I originally gave it 3 stars but now when I'm posting this (aug) I noticed that this book didn't leave anything with me. So 2 stars it is.Crimson Bound wasn’t like Cruel Beauty at all. Nix and ignifex were great and their banter so fun. Rachelle and Armand’s relationship wasn’t as good. I didn’t feel much chemistry. The author tried to portray them and their relationship from enemies to lovers/hate to love but I didn’t see it that way. It was never hinted that Armand disliked Rachelle while I felt the latter was portraying herself as hateful towards him because she has no reason to. She was mostly mistrustful of him which is very different from hate. I applaud for Hodge for having a main character with a disability (Armand doesn’t have hands). The plot moved at an antagonizing pace. The only interesting thing happened at the end.The world didn’t fascinate me either, the concept was interesting but combined with a slow pace, I lost interest. I didn't hate the book nor hated anything about it, it was just forgettable and not special at all even though the story is kind of unique with its setting. Needless to say, I won’t be reading the third book of this trilogy especially since its ratings are lower than this one.
