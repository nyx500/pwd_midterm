A Natural History of Dragons: A Memoir by Lady Trent, by Marie Brennan, is a superb novel in every regard. It's a classic, first-person adventure full of travel, science, and of course, dragons. The writing is clean, concise, and well-assured. The characters are interestingâ€”especially the main one, Isabella. The plotting is clockwork-tight. And the worldbuilding is a masterpiece of sophisticated evocation. It's clear that Brennan has put an enormous amount of thought and research into her craft. From a professional standpoint, I was highly impressed by this book. From a reader's standpoint, I had an absolute blast, and I can't wait to dive into the sequels. Based on this book alone, I place Marie Brennan in the top flight of sci-fi/fantasy authors.
