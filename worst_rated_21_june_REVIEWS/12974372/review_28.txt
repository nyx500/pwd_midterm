If there was one word to describe this novel, and all it's characters really, it would be 'charming'.I didn't really know what I was getting from this book until I read the opening chapter. I was expecting our heroine to be riding into the sunset on a dragon, bound for grand adventures, but it's less about dragon hi-jinx, and more about a little girl wanting to study dragons in a male dominated time period. Cue the knocking down of gender walls, a sweet and drama free romance, and many hypothesis over dragon anatomy. Overall, a very charming and light read, told in an amusing memoir style about a girl taking on the men, and well....dragons. 3.5 stars
