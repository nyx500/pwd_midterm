After sitting and thinking about this I am going with this start rating because I do not think I was in the right head space for an Epic Fantasy like this. By that I mean, this first novel is devoid of any mythical creatures and action like non. This was a very political, character driven story and had I known that going in I think that would have helped a little bit. Now don't get me wrong this novel was written extremely well and executed just as well. Daniel Abraham has created a very unique world which is unlike any other fantasy stories I have read and I have read a lot. But with that all I said I am reading these books in the Long Price Quartet Bind Up but I want to count them all as books and not just one big book. I am really enjoying this series and I think the second book was a tad better.
