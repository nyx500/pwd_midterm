Remember being addicted to dark fairytales like Aesop’s & Grimm’s as a kid? Then at around ten figuring it’s time you grew up, setting them aside & heading over to the library teen section? Have you missed them all these years? Check out magical realism. Hey, the same twisted supernatural tales, riddled with conflict & hidden meanings –repackaged for grownups! Practical Magic was published long before another of this genre I just read - Garden Spells - they’re both good and pretty similar. Quirky - feature a couple of sisters with polar opposite personalities - share the same understated magical elements. Where ‘Garden Spells’ was nice it was pretty much sweetness & light. This is better, improved by a darker twist – it is about witches after all. Its theme the importance of sticking together as a family; doesn’t matter if they’re a bunch of weird misfits – still family. And as every good fairytale should its got a lesson: Be careful what you wish for…. For its genre of magical-realism 4 well deserved stars Con’s: With every female in it a flawless beauty the realism aspect kinda went out the window. My intro to reading Alice Hoffman, hopefully all her characters aren’t written this way – that would wear thin real fast. “A mist appears. It’s the color of regret; it’s the color of heartbreak, the gray of doves and early morning”
