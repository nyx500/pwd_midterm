You put de lime in de coconut...And that's really the scene that I remember from the movie. Which, I had no idea came from a book back in 1998.So, I thought I should remedy that during this Halloween season.I'm going to be honest, I'd heard this sucked in comparison to the movie, and maybe that made me go into it with lower expectations.But I really liked it. It's different, though, no doubt. But it was different in a way that I enjoyed. In fact, I liked the book better than I did the movie. For me, there was always an indefinable something missing. And I found it in the book.I love reading about some witchy women who have to deal with life a lot like the rest of us do. Except for the magic. Just on the off chance that you don't know the plot, the gist is that two sisters are orphaned and raised by their witchy aunts. Gillian is wild and eventually runs away to party all over the world. And Sally, who has always been the responsible one, gets married and has two daughters of her own. Tragedy strikes them both, and they find out how strong they are and what family actually means to women like themselves who are touched by magic.Unlike the movie, you not only read about Sally & Gillian but also about Sally's two daughters who are in their teens when the final leg of the story takes place. It's a very realistically magical story if that makes any sort of sense, and I thoroughly loved it.You know, this was a surprisingly short novel that clocked in at just over 3 hours in audiobook format. If you're afraid of some of these dense fantasyesque stories that have witches in them, but want something a bit spooky around October, this might be your solution.Edit: Apparently, I've listened to the abridged version. And in my humble opinion, if a book has an abridged version, it probably needed it. Most of the time, less is more. Recommended. <--the abridged version anyway.
