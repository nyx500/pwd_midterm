~ 2 stars ~I did not hate this book, but I certainly didn't like it. At all. It was boring if I'm being honest. I had to push myself to read it because I didn't care about anything that was going on or anyone. The plot was really lackluster and predictable for the most part. Nothing caught me off guard because it was so heavy handed with the foreshadowing. And while I did think there was so much potential with the concept and the magic system, it fell flat. I also did not connect with any of the characters. Some were annoying, others underdeveloped. I think the only character I liked was that one mermaid, whatever her name was. I forgot her name. If that doesn't tell you enough about my experience with this book, then I don't know what does. I will be reading the second book, just out of curiosity, but overall, this book was not for me. I was so excited for this, but was sadly, I was ultimately disappointed.
