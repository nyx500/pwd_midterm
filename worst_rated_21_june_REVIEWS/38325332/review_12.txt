I received this complimentary ARC from the publisher, in exchange for an honest review.I LOVED THIS! There was so much fun and adventure!I love anything that takes place at sea and this didn’t disappoint. It had such a unique magic system. There were pirates and mermaids and sea monsters and various islands and ... it was just FUN! Of course, there were the usual politics and drama that comes with characters being members of the royal family, but it’s been a while since I’ve read a book that was just simply a fun adventure. I also liked the snark and sass that came from the characters, especially the pirate hehehe. I HIGHLY recommend it and can’t wait for the sequel!
