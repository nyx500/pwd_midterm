December 5, 2020 UPDATE:Signed and personalized copies are available for order through Mysterious Galaxy Bookstore --CONTENT WARNINGS--Now that ARCs are beginning to circulate, I also wanted to hop on here and talk about some of the content warnings in this book. Skip now, if you don't want to read them:Violence and Death: There are 7 main forms of magic in this book. One of the most commonly used ones is violent in nature, requiring blood/skin/bones, or other parts of the body. The methods to obtain these are often violent and sometimes torturous in nature. There's a blanket statement on this book for on-page graphic violence, blood, and murder. There are several character deaths throughout the novel. One of these deaths is death by suicide.There is self injury (fingernails digging into the palms to the point of blood) in chapter 31There is a brief moment of animal abuse (no animal death) in chapter 29. Sexual Assault:A character mentions past attempted sexual assault in chapter 19. Abusive Relationship:There is a severely toxic relationship that portrays emotional and physical abuse (gripping too tightly/fingers digging into skin) in chapter 29.Drinking:There is on page drinking as well of mentions of alcohol throughout the novel. Please read only the material you're comfortable with <3----I wrote this, so I'm definitely going to go ahead and mark this as read for my goodreads challenge.I'm a little biased, but this book is pretty cool and I think you'll like it. More to come, soon!
