All the cover love here! While my rating is middle of the road, I'd ask you to take my thoughts with a grain of salt, as I am NOT the target audience, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with this book. I think it's more a case of right book, wrong reader, mainly due to my fickle mood lately and my having read so many pirate themed YA fantasy books in the past year. The writing was really well done and I have no doubt that the author is one we'll see many great things from in the years ahead. Definitely recommended to those searching for more of the nautical adventures that YA fantasy has to offer!*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.
