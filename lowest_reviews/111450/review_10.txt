DNF.. I'm not sure what I expect before reading this book, but I guess I didn't expect it to read like a boring history book. Though "Through the Ages" is a dead giveaway. I do like that there's humor. The book started out slow but got better at the Golden Snitch chapter. I like the illustrations, especially the quaffle balls and the scoring baskets. I like the different ways this story is written. It includes letters and newspaper clippings. It makes the read a bit more interesting. I got bored with the different teams and lost interest after.
