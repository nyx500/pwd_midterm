Game On!!!GO TEAM!I didn't know what to expect about this book written by the magical J.K. Rowling about the "history" of the magic sport of Quidditch.However, I was happily surprised that while some chapters explaining the rules of the "sport" are kinda tiresome, they were the few, since other chapters were really amusing and entertaining.You "learn" why the decission of using brooms to fly.Also, you "learn" about the official Quidditch teams on the British league, but even also you will learn about how popular or not is this sport in other countries and continents.It's a book written with the heart of Rowling allowing to appreciate an important element of the magical world of Harry Potter beyond of what you may knew about on the book series.You won't be dissapointed......and don't let go away that Golden Snitch!!!
