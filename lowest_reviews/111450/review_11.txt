Slightly better than FB, this one reads like a long a boring textbook on the history of a wizarding game.But that's probably because it's exactly that. :)Don't get me wrong. It's fascinating in its way, but I've never cared much for ANY kind of sports history. It bores me to tears. :) At least this has magic, no? It's written well. It still just happens to be a short history.
