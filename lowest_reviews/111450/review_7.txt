This was awesome! I can't believe I've never read it before! I gave this 5 out of 5 not because it was a phenomenal work of literary fiction, but because of the time and effort that J.K. Rowling put into creating this amazing sport, the history, the teams, the rules, everything is phenomenally done! I love Quidditch, and being a total sports nerd this was perfect for me. The coolest thing for me was when the book discussed Canadian teams and a team called the Moose Jaw Meteorites were mentioned. They are a team that after they win they fly around with fiery sparks coming from their broom ends in magical formations which is highly anticipated by the viewers. Moose Jaw is a town not far from where I live and they have planes called Snowbirds that fly together in the most amazing formations and people from all over come to watch. J.K. Rowling really put in her all with this by diving into the research. I definitely suggest this if you're interested in learning more about this magical sport, and just as a little extra Harry Potter read! 5 out of 5!
