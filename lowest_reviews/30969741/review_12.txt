After reading the reviews, it seems An Enchantment of Ravens is a divisive tale. People either really like it, or they don't.I am so happy to report that I am part of TEAM REALLY ENJOYED IT!!!Isobel, a human girl, is a highly skilled and renowned portraitist. Her number one clients, the fair folk, a race of immortal beings with sinister dispositions.Her first royal client, the Autumn Prince, Rook, proves to be a lesson in self-restraint for our sweet, Isobel. She finds him captivating and over the weeks of their sessions, she finds herself becoming more and more enamored with him.She sees something in Rook that she hasn't seen in any other fair folk she has previously painted. Emotion. A raw, uncensored 'human' emotion. More specifically, sorrow. She paints his portrait, displaying that feeling in his eyes.Upon seeing the portrait, Rook unexpectedly flies into a rage. How dare she paint him as such? Before Isobel realizes what is happening, he goes all Lord Grantham on her......and snatches her away to travel to the Autumnlands to stand trial for her insolence. However as their journey begins, they notice that something seems to be amiss in the world of the Fae. Soon the two find themselves being hunted and even worse, falling for one another.This was a beautifully written story of forbidden love. I was sold, hook, line and sinker. My one issue, it wasn't long enough. I was left wanting more! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a little whimsy in their love stories.
