I just read the most wonderful book! Oh, how fun it was to get my Fae on 😊Isobel lives in Whimsy with Emma and the two adopted little girls. Isobel is a most wonderful painter, this is her craft. She paints for the fae. Her most regular client over the years is Gadfly. ****Might be some spoilers ahead****So one day, Gadfly tells Isobel she is to be visited by the autumn prince the next day to paint his portrait. Well, of course this freaks Isobel out. She rushes around trying to buy up all the paint she might need. On her way home she is attacked by an evilness from the fae world. BUT, the lovely autumn prince saves her. This autumn prince is named Rook. I mean it's fitting because he can shapeshift but he mostly shifts into a raven. My heart, yes! I'm in love with him ❤️While Isobel is painting his portrait they start to enjoy each other's company but Rook is whisked away to fight in the great hunt. He sends someone for the painting and is mad at what she drew. So he decides to drag her to fae land to have a reckoning of sorts. They get into all kinds of trouble along the way and there are some funny moments with their banter. I loved it. Anyway, they make it to the spring court where Gadfly is and after a day, all hell breaks loose! Isobel and Rook are fighting for their lives! But let me just say, I got my happy ending 😊💕Happy Reading. Mel ❤️MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List
