4.5 ★ This book is charming and wonderful. I adore it, and it's now on my precious list of comfort books. Margaret Rogerson’s writing is beautiful and completely transported me into the world she created. Her characters are also layered and charming; They are the best parts of her books to me. I really enjoyed that Rogerson wrote the fair folk, or faeries, as a dangerous group of immortals. Rather than humanising them, she shows that they lack the ability to feel empathy and love. They also can’t do any craft—cooking, sewing, writing, painting—without risking their lives and are, therefore, dependent on the humans in the world for these goods and services. But the fae are still in power because they have incredible magic that humans covet and fear. I feel like I learned so much about quirky, powerful, and dangerous faeries in this book.The highlight of this book were the characters, especially Isobel and Rook. Their interactions were such treat to read. I giggled so much at their banter and was so entertained by their adventure together. I couldn’t get enough of them.“I was alive in a way I never had been before, in a world that no longer felt stale but instead crackled with breathless promise.”Isobel is honest, refreshing, and witty. I found her so relatable at times, and I appreciated her subtle humour. While most humans in this world are enamoured by faerie enchantments, our girl Isobel doesn’t buy into it. She’s all like: I just want to continue being a successful portrait artist, and make sure my sisters are protected and well fed; I don’t trust the fair folk or their trickery. Isobel's character growth is impressive. We get to see her allow herself to make mistakes and be a little reckless; to embrace and believe in herself. “Isobel, listen. The teapot is of no consequence. I can defeat anyone, at any time.”Rook is our smug, sometimes clueless, and very endearing prince. He can be blunt at times, yet so charming. He’s fae, so he doesn’t fully understand human emotions or needs but he means well and always apologises for his mistakes. I love that he protects Isobel and never breaks his promises to her. “I have never met anyone more frustrating, or brave, or beautiful. I love you.”Their romance was so fluffy, cute, and sweet. For a minute, I thought there might be some instalove. However, Isobel came through with some real self-awareness, and the romance went back to that awesome slow-burn, enemies-to-lovers that I was hoping for. The only reason I deducted half a star is because I wanted to see more of their romance. This author has written extremely lovable main characters, but only gave readers a couple of kiss moments between them. It was really sweet, but I’m left wanting a second book or novella all about Isobel and Rook's life together. We don’t need to talk about the plot. It’s there, it’s fun, but this book is very character driven and that worked perfectly for me. I’ve read a number of romances about humans and faeries, but this magical book is unlike anything I’ve read before and I cannot recommend it enough. It’s a perfectly sweet, fun, and cozy read. Even though I wanted a little more romance, the story is gorgeously told and wrapped up. I loved my time with this book and its characters. ..........✿ More Quotes ✿“But that was the problem with the old me, I was coming to realize. She'd accepted that behaving correctly meant not being happy, because that was the way the world worked. She hadn't asked enough - of life, or of herself.”“Isobel, I love you wholly. I love you eternally. I love you so dearly it frightens me. I fear I could not live without you. I could see your face every morning upon waking for a thousand years and still look forward to the next as though it were the first.”“Now stop making me feel things.”“The ability to feel is a strength, not a weakness.”“Frankly, I had no idea how anyone knew if they were in love in the first place. Was there ever a single thread a person could pick out from the knot and say ‘yes - I am in love - here's the proof!’ or was it always caught up in wretched tangle of ifs and buts and maybes?”..........Thank you so much to my lovely Lyra for recommending one of her favourite books to me. And thank you for reading my review. 💗
