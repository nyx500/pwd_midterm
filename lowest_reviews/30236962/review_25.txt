“Not everyone who reaches back into history can survive it.” I hope I will have time to write more about this book later, but one thing I need to mention is: what you hear about is true. The denouement is ridiculous and I honestly don't understand why it had to be this why, since it's more than apparent that Kostova's imagination is, to say the least, extraordinarily vivid. Dracula's motive is implausible and unconvincing, but I feel that it holds a symbolic meaning in Kostova's conception of the novel, and therefore, even though plot-wise it's nothing short of embarrassing, I can turn a blind eye on it. I can do that especially because the rest of the book, that is to say more than 620 out of a total of 700, is not only entertaining, but also both insanely instructive and insanely intriguing, and I loved it madly. More on the reasons later.Full RTC
