I don't even know what was the problem. Maybe I've just read so may ya fantasy that I can't enjoy them unless they are really unique or I deeply fall in love with the characters.With this one, based on the reviews I wasn't sure I'll like it, but it was a must because of the sapphics. And the sapphics were the only reason I didn't dnf it pretty early on, and they were the only thing I actually liked. I didn't care about this particular plot, but now that they went together into the sunrise (more like into the forest), I would totally read an adventure story with them in the focus.
