I'm also a book blogger: Vee_Bookish(ARC provided by NetGalley, my opinions are unbiased)This was one of two books I read at the same time, that I found difficult to finish because I was just so incredibly bored (the other one was Havenfall). Originally I thought that this may because we've just hit the Coronavirus epidemic, but after finishing the books I realised that they both have major issues that affected my reading.This book sounded so, so good with hella Medusa vibes. It's based around Persian mythology about a princess that cannot touch anyone cos they drop dead, presumably dramatically. It sounded cool as hell and I wanted to read it for a couple of months before it made an appearance on NetGalley.This just did not have the kick that I wanted. Like many readers, I'm tired of woe-is-me main characters that spend most of their books moping about how hard their lives are. I'm sorry, it just doesn't make for interesting reading. This character is supposed to be embracing her darker and lighter sides and she just came across as pathetic. And really, really annoying.The plot was both fairly easy to guess and overcomplicated, as well as all over the place. The various demons needed a full colour illustrated guide because I could not picture them in the slightest. The plot weirdly reminded me of Labyrinth in some places and it's really hard to discuss it's issues without giving major spoilers, as the second half is where everything happens and the first half is Soraya just mooching about the castle, moping about the one time she poked a butterfly and it died.Azad? Annoying and almost cartoonish. Soraya? Annoying. Parvaneh? Honestly kinda cool, the book would have been better from her perspective. The world building... honestly outside of Soraya's immediate area I have zero clue how that world functions and the harmony between the creatures and humans (or lack of it) is kinda glossed over. It was an interesting book with maybe a few too many things thrown at it.
