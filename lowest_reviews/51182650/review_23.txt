Star Rating: ‚Äî> 4.5 StarsWell, I have to say I was a bit nervous going into this, given the mixed reviews and total GR rating being just under 4 stars (which btw this confounds me‚Äî I truly believe this deserves AT LEAST 4 solid stars, but ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) ... I have to say, though, that this was absolutely magical, fantastic & everything my mythology/folklore loving heart could‚Äôve asked for! Such an awesome look into Persian mythology, which is one culture whose folklore tales I was not at all familiar with before this novel.It was very much told in a beautiful, atmospheric, & layered fairytale format and I loved every second of it‚Äî it was utterly transportive!The plot consistently keeps you on your toes, twist after twist, & deception after deception; you literally never know who you could actually trust‚Äî sometimes even the main character, Soraya, was suspect! Soraya is very much a morally grey character & I dig that SOMUCH. Give me a complex, morally grey character any day, any time, anywhere.Plus Soraya & Parvaneh... ahhh BE STILL MY HEART; so COMPLETELY in love with some queer romance in this wonderful fairytale. I know this brief, I but I do not want to spoil anything about this wonderful, wonderful myth-like fairytale. I truly loved this dark romp in Persian mythology from start to finish. I highly recommend this to any fantasy lover, world mythologies lover, fairytale lover, & well, anyone at all !10/ 10 Recommend!
