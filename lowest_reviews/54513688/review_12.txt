3.5/5  “A king of ashes is still a king.”   First things first, if you are just starting out in the fantasy genre,  this book is an excellent starting point.  It has everything a solid fantasy book should have, and it checks off lots of boxes on what makes an enjoyable book. That being said, behind a self proclaimed fantasy connoisseur, I have really specific tastes.This book has lots of good elements, but it’s let down by the amount of POV’s, slow plot, and overall lack of immersive world building.We have so many characters in this book and 5 POV’s that it’s almost too much. The thing is I like multiple POV books. But with this book, the way it was one POV per chapter specifically and had an uneven distribution of POV’s, made it less enjoyable. and towards the end I had to force myself to read I was so uninterested. Our MC is  Corayne  and she really wasn’t interesting. She was a typical fantasy heroine and didn’t really bring anything new to the table. Her POV was the most common and also the most boring. She just was pretty bland for me. she’s the chosen one and all that, but she doesn’t do anything. Most of the decisions made aren’t hers, and she really doesn’t have much personality. Andry  is another MC who has a POV. He’s likeable but, again, he doesn’t have a personality that you can really describe. He’s kind and sweet but beyond adjectives, he isn’t really anything. He’s just.... there.  Sorasa  was annoying. She’s the assassin and she just is..... there. She kind of is your typical assassin character I guess and she has a mysterious past and all that and that was that. She’s basically the trope of being super intelligent and powerful and not letting anyone in and also having a mysterious past that involves people wanting to kill her. How original. Domacridhan, or Dom  is the immortal MC. His POV’s are just okay. Like I think by now you can see a pattern. He isn’t that interesting, has no actual personality and overall doesn’t bring anything new to the book. He’s the immortal who refuses to feel anything trope , but made 10x more boring and uninteresting.Everyone is boring. That is, everyone but  Erida . She’s a villain, yes. But her POV is interesting. She has unique goals and her marriage of convenience with Taristan (the real true villain) is interesting and the possible villain romance between them? Yes. She actually has motives with the want to prove herself and to protect her kindgom’s legacy. Being Queen since she was fifteen I believe, she has lots of decisions to make and she is interesting. The only character I liked. She’s strategic, smart, and most of all, makes powerful decisions.  “If I must betray the kingdom to save her, I will do so.”  The plot is a solid fantasy plot. It’s easy to follow and really not complicated. That being said it’s boring. It’s  typical . There aren’t any plot twists, the one there was I guessed a mile away. It’s start of a book that is a lot of preparing and getting the group assembled to fight rather than fight. It has an approach where the characters are supposed to make you stay, not the plot. That being said I can see the plot becoming interesting. I just have higher expectations at this point for most books and for a high fantasy book inspired by LOTR I was expecting more from it.  “Sorrow is a mortal endeavour. I have no use for it.”  The setting is a typical fantasy setting. Nothing that makes it stand out in my mind, or that interesting. The magic of the world isn’t described nor are the creatures. Or even who What Waits is. Like ?? Is it a god? Idk. Also the lack of romance kind of made this book flat. Like the villain romance was right there but it’s not there yet. The other two romances that I have a feeling will develop in later books had the possibility to start with a crush or something. But that’s just my opinion. I like romance in my books 😌At the end of the day it’s a good book and really solid but it wasn’t for me.   “You are a realm breaker.”
