TRIGGER WARNING: Explicit scenes of animal hunting, murder and removal of their bones. Okay...So I'm debating whether to give it 3 stars or keep it at 4.I've just finished the book and I don't fully understand that it has already finished. I mean, I know it's the first part of a duology but I think I have been missing more information. I haven't finished believing the love story, which is bad, because it's the plot of the story. The only thing that makes me save the book enough is Sabine. Such a badass woman.Her growth in history is incredible and I loved it.She's definitely my favorite character without a doubt.Ailesse has been a fighter and I really liked her personality, her attitude, a very good main character.I loved the fight/action scenes, they are very well written. The story behind each mystery that arises is perfectly built. I also loved the construction of the fantastic/magical places and the peculiarities of these mythical beings, that are the Bone Criers.(About the warning: I don't think the scenes are very explicit, in fact I haven't had any problem reading it because I know in advance that it's fiction and my mind doesn't imagine these scenes in detail. I also prefer to warn you by exaggerating it a little more, than I really think it is, because there may be people who are more sensitive on certain topics. But in my opinion, if you situate yourself as fiction, you can read it with ease.)Review coming soon...
