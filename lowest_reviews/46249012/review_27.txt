What a great surprise I got with this book, I liked it so much, and that cover, WONDERFUL üíñ The concept of the plot impressed me and I didn't expect to like it as much as it did."Bone Crier's Moon", presents us with a story where women attract their love, his soulmate to sacrifice it, and thus fulfill their duty of ferrying good and bad souls of the kingdom between the living and the dead.Now, the beginning is slow, many details need to be read carefully because the plot can seem somewhat confusing if you get to read quickly, I will not lie, I even read some of the first chapters twice, but then when the time comes as in any story where the protagonists meet for the first time, I devoured him.The book is written in three POVs. Ailesse who is in charge of making the sacrifice and Bastien who arrived to make a mess by kidnapping her to get revenge on her and her species. On the other hand, we have Sabine, Ailesse's best friend who, after being present at the kidnapping, plans to rescue her.Romance is an enemy to lovers, and although I felt that it happened very quickly that they hated each other at the beginning and then loved each other, as it was not surprising, I am used to most books in less than two months already loving each other, enjoy your moments of connection and where they know each other more emocionally.Throughout more than 400 pages, there are several surprises and plot twists that I didn't expect at all, and I want to say that although it doesn't seem at first that Sabine's chapters are important and that maybe everything revolves around Ailesse and Bastien. Sabine also goes through a change in her character and there are some secrets she discovers about herself and although there are still things to be explained in more detail, I imagine and hope that the second book will clarify it.Overall, It was a fantasy with characters and a well constructed plot, I enjoyed so much, and I'm waiting for the second book because that ending leaves everything in suspense...‚≠ê4 STARS ‚≠ê
