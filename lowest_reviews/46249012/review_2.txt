3.75 stars This had some elements I really loved: fated lovers; death magic; characters with a connection to the moon; thieves; strong lady friendship.. however some elements were weaker than others. The mythology, while really cool, felt incomplete at times. Bone Criers guide the dead to the underworld, and are all ladies that get their power from both the moon and animals that they wear the bones of. But, there were some elements of this mythology that seemed too simple and weren't explained. We may get more in the second book though. I wasn't thrilled about the female relationships as well, outside of the best friendship between the two main female characters. There's some jealousy between Ailesse and Bastien's lady best friend which felt over the top, and Ailesse's mother is a cold figure motivated by some classic tropes that made her feel one dimensional. This definitely feels slightly on the younger end of YA, especially with the big focus on the love story, but I still find the mythology intriguing enough (and I do love star crossed lovers) that I'd be willing to continue with this series.
