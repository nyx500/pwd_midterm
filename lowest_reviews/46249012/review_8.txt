2021 F.A.B. Bookclub pick # I.❤️. F.A.B. I really want to enjoy the fantasy genre…. and I’ve been lucky to find a few gems (between the hundreds I’ve read) that I actually loved. 😉 But most of them end up in this… ehhh?! 🤷🏼‍♀️… categorization for me. This was just that (ehhh?! 🤷🏼‍♀️). I didn’t feel like I could totally “see” and “know” what was going on. My imagination sucks, but I’m gonna keep trying! ❤️📚
