TW: some blood magic/self harm This was an unexpected delight. The world is lush and well described, with a ocean vibe that could have been cheesy but I really enjoyed. There were a few tropes that I thought would be typical and predictable, but they actually got turned in their head in this story and felt new. Our main character is flawed while still being ultimately determined to be a good leader in a way that I don’t always find believable when it’s been done in other books. The romance is also banter-filled while developing into something very supportive and mature. I also enjoyed the found family aspects of the friend group. This is a duology I’m looking forward to continuing.
