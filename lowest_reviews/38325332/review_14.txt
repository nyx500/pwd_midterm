This was wildly entertaining. Magic and Pirates? I was already sold and sold even further by the writing, plot and characters which were all so gripping.The only thing I didn't buy into was the love interest, I didn't feel the chemistry and thought the plot would function just as well without it if I'm honest (which is saying a lot for me!)
