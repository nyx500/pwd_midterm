I've DNFed more books that I care to lately, but nowadays when I say I don't have time for boring books, I really mean it. Since I'm studying and attending college for up to 30 hours a week (ha! Get that education, bruh!), I genuinely have to ration my time, and that means not gritting my teeth through books like this, which are the literary equivalent of candy floss: partially corporeal, not something you go out looking for but tend to pick up as an impulse buy. I always see candy floss and buy it because it looks nice, but then as soon as it passes my lips, I remember how much I hate it. It's not food. It's not even food-adjacent. It's like the devil's armpit hair. What I'm trying to say is that this book is devoid of substance. It might be a fun little read if you're feeling blue and want to switch your brain off, but...well. Wattpad exists, and that shit's free.
