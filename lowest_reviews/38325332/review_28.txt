I read an ARC of this book.I know everyone is so excited to read this book (I thought it sounded very interesting), but I just could not get into it. The author spent quite a bit of time, especially at the beginning, describing scenery, locations, and people's wardrobes and make-up, and I kept waiting for the action to start. Then time was spent explaining the mythology, culture, and background of the world of the characters, but I still was waiting for the action to start.Once it finally did, I just could not get into the story. For me, the characters felt two-dimensional and didn't have much rooting value. I found myself not caring what happened to them, and not even liking them very much. When I put the book down, I really had no desire to pick it back up.I know this is a highly anticipated title, and probably many people who enjoy fantasy YA will like it. I did not, though.
