My initial thoughts were is this Red Queen in reverse?Included in my January Wrap Up video youtube.com/watch?v=NBn9SQpYUvQI could tell from the first chapter that I probably wasn't going to like this but the trooper I am I ploughed on. You can smell the love triangle from chapter 3.The protagonist Amora is a self-centred, privileged, entitled, spoilt brat. Huh ok then mayb- NO, THERE IS LITTLE TO NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.I thought there was a fairly good twist towards the end - but the ending felt kinda rushed. The book takes ages and ages to build everything up and then the climax is over in a couple of chapters.Not going to read the sequel.1.5 stars
