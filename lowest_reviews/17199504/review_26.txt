WOW. So happy I finally picked up this book! It's sat on my shelf for a couple of years and I wish I'd read it sooner!I read this in 2 days. If that doesn't show how much I enjoyed it...Being book one of a fantasy series (with lots of hard to pronounce names) it took me a little while to feel like I understood what was really happening. There were also a few parts where info was dumped pretty heavily, but it wasn't too bad. I'm really intrigued by this new world and I don't feel like I've ever read anything quite like this. I quickly loved it and can't wait to see where the series goes from here!For some reason Nashira gave me Amarantha vibes (From A Court of Thorns and Roses I hate both characters so it works haha Now that I think about it I'm seeing some similarities with Rysand and Arcturus as well... hmm.
