Read this back in 2009 (age 16) and I remember liking it a lot, and recommending it to my best friend (we had a Book Club of 2 xD - still do actually).I remember dissecting Laurel's interactions with David and Tamani and trying to figure out who she would choose.It was an ok book in 2009, but if I hadn't these nostalgic memories (not of the story itself, but of passing books back and forth with my best friend and our friendship), I don't think I would've tolerated it as well as I did now, 11 years later.Laurel is the Mary Suest Mary Sue to ever Mary Sue. David and Tamani are nothing to write home about. I'm glad the love triangles stayed (mostly) in the 2000s. There's no real character development or real plot to speak of really, but this is not the worst book I've read this year. That honor belongs to  Marked, and honestly, I don't think I'll be rating another book 1 star any time soon - not if in doing so I'm saying it's as bad as Marked. So 2 stars for the nostalgia factor. It's also not riddled with problematic stuff that was rampant for it's time. There were a few jarring comments that would not fly in a 2020 pub, but that was to be expected.I started the sequel right away, because I own the whole series. Let's see what happens.Just a quick trigger warning: Laurel's parent's are anti vaxxers - it's somewhat unclear if it's due to the overaching 'plot' (I'm using that word quite liberally here) but it still sets my blood boiling either way, 'cause you know. Science and kids not needlessly getting sick or dying are things I care about.
