TBR Reduction Challange #5 (Kirsten)Alright guys, I’m throwing in the towel. I just can’t get over the fact that the girl has a giant flower growing out of her back. Ew. I mean, eeeew. Yeah, and then there are some things that just plain annoy me. Dialogues like this one for example:...It took her a few seconds to find her voice."Who are you?"He paused and studied her with a strange, unflinching look in his eyes."Well?" Laurel prompted."You don’t know me, do you?" He asked.Um, I don’t know about you but I think the question "Who are you" kind of implies that she does not know him. *headdesk*What I have to admit, though, is that this book is quite funny. Unintentionally so, but still funny.Statements like "Don’t worry, I’ll keep my distance from your blossom." had me in tears because I was laughing so hard. (For more on that, check out Arlene’s awesome review)I’ve read 112 pages now and I’m still not hooked and I just don’t feel like finishing it. Furthermore the whole plant thing makes it incredibly hard, if not impossible for me to take any of this seriously. I’m bursting out laughing every other sentence.I don't know, maybe I would have gotten used to the plant thing if I had kept on reading but as I said, I don't feel like it so for now Wings is going to find its way back into the depths of my shelves where it has been hiding out for the past year. Thanks for the push anyway Kirsten!
