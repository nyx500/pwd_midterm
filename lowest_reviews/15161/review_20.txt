A snack in the guise of delicatessen. It is considerably more relaxed and whimsical than Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, to the point of being, at times, a bit silly. I found On Lickerish Hill, Mrs Mabb and John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner to be quite good. The one starring Mary Queen of Scots is fun too. But most are inane; a couple are boring and befuddling (the title story, for instance). In short, this is one for the fans of Clarke's magnum opus. Some might enjoy revisiting her world with its unique take on magic (at once lovecraftian and mischievous), others like myself will find it lacking.
