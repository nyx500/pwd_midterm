These short stories are set in the world of her first novel, "Jonathan Strange And Mr Norrell", and if you have some trouble reading the novel (because of its size, or its pace, etc.), this might be another way to start with - it doesn't really spoil the novel's plot, though at least two of the persons from that book appear here, too. The art accompanying the stories is beautiful (and familiar to those who have read Gaiman's "Sandman" comic series) and works well with the stories.From the start I found myself enjoying my reading, just from reading the clever introduction. The language used to tell the tales made the reading a delight, ending with a particularly funny one. The fairy world isn't the center place for these stories, remaning mostly on the edges of the story (or being very very subtly nodded towards, as in the Mary Queen Of Scots story. People in the stories deal with the fairies with varying levels of success and comfort, but at least two of the humans here manage to outwit the arrogantly confident faeries very well (to the point that the faeries make a point of avoiding further encounters with them).Stories:Title story: Jonathan Strange finds a trio of ladies quite unsettling.On Lickerish Hill: Another version to add to the story of Tom Tit Tot/Rumpelstiltskin.Mrs Mabb: How miss Venetia fought to get her lover back, no matter what obstacles.The Duke Of Wellington Misplaces His Horse: set in the world of Neil Gaiman's "Stardust"; where scissors and a needle are useful weapons.Mr Simonelli Or The Fairy Widower: in which he finds the truth about his own family in a Derbyshire village, told through diary entries of 1811.Tom Brightwind Or How The Fairy Bridge Was Built At Thoresby: a favor granted brings strange results, in 1780.Antickes And Frets: where Mary Queen Of Scots gets interested in embroidery while a prisoner of Queen Elizabeth.John Uskglass And The Cumbrian Charcoal Burner: how the latter got the former to repair damage done, and repair well.Waiting for her next book, one finds a mention of Piranesi already here, in the Tom Brightwind story, if one reads carefully. :)I think the first and the last story were my favorites, but every story had something awesome, and something to think about (like, what Mr Simonelli's character was really like, now that the reader knows his father was a faerie; or how Tom Brightwind's son dealt with his mother's home village until boredom made him leave), and left me with deeper appreciation of the JS & MN book - which I'm sure I'll reread again someday. So for those who have read the novel, or for those who would want to enter into the 'verse easily, or whatever, this book is a great read and much fun.
