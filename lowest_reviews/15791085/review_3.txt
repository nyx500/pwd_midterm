how dare this end on a cliffhanger. i had made it until the very end, positive i wasnt going to continue the series, and then it ends the way it does and now im forced to find out what happens next. i feel swindled. lol. i guess that means i was slightly more invested in this story that i originally thought i was, hence the rounding up. i just really wish it didnt take the ending to make me realise it - i wanted to be more engaged throughout. still, i can appreciate the unique world building. i think this is the first book ive read where fae are actually quite violent. its definitely a change of pace from the fae stories im familiar with. i also like the time period, although there are a few discrepancies and inconsistencies here and there. overall, not a horrible book, although i do wish some aspects were better. fingers crossed it improves with the next book. â†  3.5 stars
