Aileana is a upper class Scottish girl living in 1844, recently back out on the social scene a year after her mother's death. Though before she fit into it all seamlessly, after watching a faery murder her mother she has become changed. She has spent the past year training with another one of the fae, Kiaran, to kill the fae. I think with books a lot of times there's this trade off between the writing and the story telling and honestly I would much rather have good story telling than good writing. When I started reading the book I was a little annoyed at how immature the writing seemed, but it's ya so it's not really meant for someone as old as I am so I kept reading and I'm really glad I did. After about five pages I started to really get into the story. It was so good, the way it all flows and builds up to that final scene at the end was excellent. I also really liked all the characters, I can't think of one person who got on my nerves through out the book. Aileana is a sweetheart and I love Derrick. The steampunk thing was pretty cool too, I haven't read a lot of things incorporating that but I enjoyed it here and wouldn't mind reading more of it in the future. I can understand people may not have enjoyed it because it parallels others series they've read or because it seems like a typical YA book but I think when reading YA people should really be more realistic about their expectations. Things like this story have been done but I think this is a terrific execution of the story and that is worthwhile to read.
