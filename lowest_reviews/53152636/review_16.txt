well, wasnt this just a spooky little story?! i knew i should have saved this for next month.fans of gothic stories will swoon over this. its so atmospheric. the old mansion, the creepy family who lives there, the lush mexican countryside. i was honestly really, really enjoying myself up until the near end.the turn of events were a little too… unrealistic for me, i suppose. i wanted to gasp in shock but i ended up just rolling my eyes. i know the way things play out wont bother some readers, and it does fit the feel/vibe of the story, but something about it all was underwhelming for me. which is why im not rating this higher.but again, gothic fans will love and this and i have no problem recommending this to people wanting the spooky autumnal feel. ↠ 3.5 stars
