4.25ðŸŒŸIâ€™ve been longing for some magical experience from a book and i must say this book was just dazzlinggg!! Throughout the first half of the book i really thought that this would be a 5 star read but of course, when it comes to atmospheric typa books (beautifully written, i must add) they tend to drag a little. Nonetheless, world building & set up = BOMB. Suri is definitely up to par with Laini Taylor and S. A Chakraborty.Also, being a hopeless romantic reader i was OBV SHIPPING THESE TWO STUBBORN ASSES -THEY DONT WEAR THEIR HEARTS ON THEIR SLEEVES- SO HARD!! But unfortunately the author seems to only be able to tell how in love both of the main characters are instead of showing, nomsayin??? so that was a bit anticlimactic since it was slow burn AF
