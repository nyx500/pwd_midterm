I thought I'd just read for a hour or so before bed to make sure my bedtime snack had enough time to settle. Yeah, that didn't work. LOL Six hours after starting, and no sleep later, I finished.I couldn't put the book down! :) I cried, I laughed, I enjoyed this story. It's a fun read, but not in a 'fluffy' way. When I picked up this book at the library, the summary didn't sound too terribly interesting, but then I saw it said 'set in the land of Ella Enchanted.' (Or something like that.) I remember reading that years (way before the movie ;) ago after one of my sister's recommeded it, and I really liked it, so I thought I'd give this one a try. I'm really glad I did! :) I look forward to reading more of this author's work (and she may become one of my favorite authors!)I would definitely recommend this book! :)(The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there are some books I like more. I'd give it a 4.9 if I could.)
