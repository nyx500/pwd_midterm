{May 2023 Reread}Doesn't hold up quite as well as it did when I was younger, but is still fun as an occasional read. I love that a decent bit of it takes place in a cavern/gnomish kingdom, because that's a setting that's far too underused in fantasy.Sometimes Levine's simplistic writing style works and sometimes it doesn't. This book is toeing the line throughout, teetering towards either side by turns. I misplaced it as to reading level when I was younger; I'd definitely classify it as middle-grade instead of young adult, now. (Not a bad thing, of course -- just a note.) I got a lot of secondhand embarrassment, this time around, from the characters' habit of randomly singing a lot of their lines. Levine passes this off as a part of Ayorthian culture's love of song, but there are plenty of other nods to that throughout the book (mass Sings as social events, etc.). We don't need the spontaneous warbling.Still, again, a decently fun and quick read.
