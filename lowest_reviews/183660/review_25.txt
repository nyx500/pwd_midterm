Listened to this. The full Cast Audio production is AMAZING! They actually sng all the songs. I was humming them afterwards. It was like watching a musical.As for the story, fun but predictable as fairy tale retellings often are. I found this one, being in the same world as Ella Enchanted to be totally entertaining, though.Very heavy-handed with the whole beauty isn't everything etc. message. Overall, if you're going to read this book, listen to it instead!!
