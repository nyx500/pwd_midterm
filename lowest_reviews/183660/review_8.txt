I don't hate myself enough to continue to read this book. Going to find something else to fit the "A Grimm Tale" square. I just don't have the patience for the singing or Aza and others talking about how ugly she is every freaking five seconds. My biggest issue is that Aza's not interesting enough to read as a re-imagining of "Snow White." She's mean at times to her sister and family cause she's not beautiful, though it makes no sense why she's not besides the fact she doesn't look like others around her. She apparently has a fantastic singing voice she can throw and bah. I just don't care.Aza is a foundling in the kingdom of Ayortha. Apparently being beautiful and being able to sing are the only things people care about. Aza is tall, has dark hair, pale skin, and red lips and is therefore ugly (I am playing the world's smallest violin). Her family hides her away in the tavern (not really, she acts like a fool if anyone sees her and most people don't seem to care and or know her) until a Duchess needs Aza to accompany her to the royal wedding. So even though Aza is so ugly that she can make death die, she is still invited as companion (this made zero sense to me and I don't care enough to fixate on it). Aza goes to court and of course the new Queen has zeroed in on her.The writing is repetitive, and I loathed all the songs. Maybe I hate happiness? Who knows. I think the main thing is that there is barely any character development to Aza and zero to everyone else. I just didn't have the energy to completely finish a book I knew I was going to be lukewarm about.
