Fairest is a nice and entertaining retelling of Snow White, and I would have enjoyed it a lot more had I not believed it would be as good as Ella Enchanted. Yes, I know it is not fair, but I just couldn't help myself. Aza herself is a sweet character though rather bland in comparison to spunky Ella, and Ijori, nice though he is, turns out a little too generic. He felt like a slighlty watered down version of Prince Char, with a dog. I was dissapointed we did not get to see his relationship with Aza develop more before they admitted their feelings for each other, the way we did with Ella and Char. I must admit, nevertheless, that making Queen Ivi a rounded character instead of an archetypical Evil Queen was a nice touch. One thing that surprised me was that the mystery surrounding Aza's birth was never unveiled, when from the beginning I thought it would be used as an important plot point later on. I liked Aza's gift of illusing but I believed it could have been used in a much more interesting way than it was done.Another thing I noticed was that, in Ella Enchanted, Prince Char wrote a letter to Ella in which he commented Ayorthaian nobles hardly ever spoke, but in this book, the nobles seem quite talkative to me. Mhmm...Overall, Fairest was good, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.
