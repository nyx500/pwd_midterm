When I read a book, especially when I read fantasy, I find myself mentally putting myself in the place of the protagonist. Which is why my very favorite books of all time are the books that have strongly developed protagonists that I can identify with well in some way or another. I had a hard time enjoying this book at all to start with because the protagonist and I could not be more different. Superficially, Aza is tall, wide, has dark hair and white skin (I'm short, small, blond, and tan easily). Also she has an amazing singing voice (I can't sing to save my life). Small things like this could be overlooked if she had some mental or personality characteristic I could identify with or get to like. But she doesn't. She starts off by being socially awkward, lying to everyone, and allowing herself to be pushed around. I HATE it when main characters are this stupid! And the prince falling for her right away is totally not even believable. I'm sorry, but people don't fall in what is apparently love at first sight with people who are physically unattractive (and especially men do not do this). Maybe he could have come to be attracted to her with time and as he got to know her, but with the way this story is set up, I'm finding it very hard to suspend my disbelief for the entire length of it.Anyway, the idea of a country where everyone sings instead of speaks as often as possible and birds fly around in the halls and make messes on people seemed pretty ridiculous to me. And to sum it up, that was the impression this story left on me. If I had to choose one word to describe it, it would be just that: ridiculous. I generously gave it two stars because there are probably some young girls who would enjoy the fairy tale aspect despite all the cheesy and irritating elements.
