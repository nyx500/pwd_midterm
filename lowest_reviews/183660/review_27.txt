Yet another wonderfully intriguing and refreshing story from Gail Carson Levine. This story was set in the world of her older book "Ella Enchanted" and was about the older sister of Arreita.(I'm sure I didn't spell that right.) A spin off of the fairytale Snow white, this was a nice, new rendition of the old fable. I love how Levine intertwines the original stories of snow white and Ella Enchanted with interesting new characters, settings, and plotline. I often found myself forgetting I was even reading the story of snow white because I was swept up so much in the story itself. When a nip of the original came in, I was happily surprised and kept saying to myself... "Neat! Oh, now I see how this all links together!"As usual with Levine's writing, the characters draw you in and pull you right along with them as they go on their adventures. Her writings always make me feel as if I'm standing in the room, seeing everything pan out.I'm not one for fantasy books, but I don't mind dipping my toes in for a bit of Levine's Masterful writing. She always gets me by the first/second page.A few things you may want to know: There was a few kisses, and a section where the heroine climbs into a pool naked to wash herself. (That's basically the description Levine gave. It didn't go further than the use of the word "naked," though that in itself I felt wasn't needed.) To further inform for parents of younger readers, there was no peeping tom in that scene, thankfully. Also, as usual with Levine's writings and fantasy books in general, there were ogres, gnomes, a magic mirror, etc. So, there is magic and mystical creatures also.
