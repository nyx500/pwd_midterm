Snow White is a story that doesn't necessarily appeal to me. It's about beauty and jealousy and the cliche evil stepmother. That is not what this book is about. Fairest is an incredibly subvervise retelling. The main character is not beautiful, and the queen is not jealous of her beauty. Aza's most praised quality is her beautiful singing voice. She's not a flawless, saintly character either. I like the message sent here around beauty, that everyone is beautiful to someone. Snow White has such an emphasis on beauty, and it was nice to see that subverted. VERDICT: Gail Carson Levine's retellings are truly so amazing, and I'm so glad I read these as a kid. Definitely recommended to preteens, although maybe not quite as much as Ella Enchanted.
