Nice read! I loved this one when I finished it yesterday and I am so sorry I am tired and have a headache right now so I am not going to write even a decent review on this one.PARENT NOTE: This book does talk about how she feels she is "fat" and how she wants to get it gone, but it isn't that bad... but if you are worried in any way I suggest you read it and give others your opinion on this book and comment below to tell anyone else. AGE RECOMMENDATION: 13 and up for things mentioned in the "Parent note" above.LANGUAGE: A few words if any. READER NOTE: Amazing book! I loved this one and it is a must read!
