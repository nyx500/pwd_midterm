This book is very good. The story is very sweet. I love how it's based on Snow White, but the author went in-depth with the story, and the plot is much more complicated; Levine took Snow White and revised it, making it a better, more interesting story. She took the flat characters from Snow White and made them round and three-dimensional. For example, instead of making the queen completely evil and power-crazy, she made her insecure, foolish, weak, slightly barmy, and easy to manipulate. Everything horrible that the queen does, it's either out of stupidity, insecurity, or because someone else convinced her to do it. I could really sympathize with Queen Ivi, but at the same time I hated her guts; which is an interesting combination. I love those moments of realization when a lightbulb flashes over you and you go, "Whoa! Snow White moment!" The story idea is really creative, and it's very nice. The writing style has a nice, musical tone; when I was reading the book, it felt like a song. And I love how Levine chose to portray the dangers and hype of beauty. This was great! ;D
