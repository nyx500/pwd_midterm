An absolutely wonderful and engaging read! I couldn't put it down!And intriguing embroilment of jealousy and finding what you love in yourself set the stage for this great, easy read. The protagonist has a kind spirit and great depth that shows an emotion that especially young ladies can connect and even contrast with. The world, while I hope someday gets expanded (maybe it has?) is well spanned for the plot. A great read!!
