This story had such an amazing theme of struggling against vanity and discovering inner beauty. Ayortha's culture of singing and all things related to it was so beautiful. Makes me want to visit it and stay awhile (especially to play the hilarious composing song). ;) I loved the world building with the songbirds, the library, and the beautiful singing hall. It was delightful to experience a similar setting to Ella Enchanted (Areida was the main character's younger sister!) even though it was only a neighboring kingdom. I loved the dear, sweet king Oscaro; and Aza's parents were some of the best book parents I've read about in a while. The villain was very complicated, and it was easy to feel slightly sympathetic to them when you discovered who was really behind their evilness. Aza was such a realistic character! It was easy to feel sorry for her when she felt sorry for herself and learn to accept her looks when she had to. Although the romance wasn't as realistic as the one between Ella and Char, it was really sweet and I loved Prince Ijori even more when I discovered his very first opinions of Aza. Not recommended for younger readers because of romance including quite a bit of premarital kissing and thematic magic including "spells" and potions. Also there is one short scene at the gnome cavern when Aza is bathing with some other women that is slightly embarrassing.Best quote: I shook my head. "Voices and faces aren't manifestations of good or bad."Altogether, I found this to be a great read for anyone who enjoyed Ella Enchanted and doesn't mind the content issues.
