Want to see more bookish things from me? check out my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfer...3.5/5 Stars When Aza was just a baby, she was found wrapped in a blanket in a room of a local inn. The innkeeper and his wife decided to raise her as their own. Aza looks different from everyone around her and considers herself to be ugly. As Aza grows older, she develops a beautiful singing voice. One day a Duchess comes to the inn and quickly finds herself in need of a companion to accompany her to the King's wedding. She chooses Aza after spending some time with her. At court, Aza meets the new Queen Ivi and her life changes drastically when she is asked to be her Lady in Waiting.I listened to this on audio book, which had a full cast which I think made the experience better for me. There is a lot of singing done in the book so having the auditory component was a great addition! This is a retelling of Snow White, but loosely in my opinion. I enjoyed Aza for the most part but her preoccupation with beauty was a bit annoying at times... which is unfortunate since that was basically the whole point of the story. Prince Ijori's interest in and immediate love for Aza didn't make must sense considering she is apparently hideous... He also turns on her very quickly even though he is apparently so in love. I did like the overall message that beauty is more than just looks and I think it gets it across in a fun and entertaining way!
