“People shouldn't have to earn kindness. They should have to earn cruelty.”I think what kept me from reading  Forever  years ago, was my fear that something depressing would happen to Grace and Sam. But most of all I didn't want the series to end, because I loved it so much. Some books just make you feel happy from inside out, they give you the feeling of being home between their pages. That's what  The Wolves of Mercy Falls  is for me. And this last part of the series was as good as the first and second one.Find more of my books on Instagram
