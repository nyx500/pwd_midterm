So, I think it is only fair to state that I had average feelings on the first book in this series and also really disliked the second book, before beginning this third instalment. Going in to this I was less than enthusiastic, which may have hindered my enjoyment before I even began. Why begin a book I was so sure I wasn't going to enjoy, you ask? Because I'm clearly a glutton for punishment with minor OCD about finishing a book series.I did find this a vast improvement from the previous book, where literally NOTHING happened, but there was still far too much angst for me to immerse myself in the story. Sam and Grace are the most melodramatic protagonists, and I could not care less about their whiny and repetitive perspectives. The previous side characters, that continued to be given a larger role as the series progressed, were this book's saving grace. Isabel and Cole each had so much sass and seeing their burgeoning romance and growing character developments felt truly special, opposed to the instantaneous attraction and endless endearments uttered by Sam and Grace.The actual plot was accessible, if pretty predictable, but not completely horrible and, as before, Stiefvater's writing continued to shine. This story, as a whole, is just not for me, but I have not written myself off from trying more of Stiefvater's renowned book series.
