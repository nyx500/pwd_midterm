Short reviews of two of the standout stories in this anthology.The Lightning Tree is another delightfully Rothfussian tale of mellifluous whimsy.If like me, you are regularly tempted to reread a certain Rothfuss series but don't always have the time, then this novella is the perfect in-between measure. “No one taller than the stoneCome to blacktree, come aloneTell no adult what’s been said,Lest the lightning strike you dead”Art by Echo ChernikThe story of The Lightning Tree is a wonderful glimpse into what Bast gets up to in a single day. There is no traditional plot, but rather we follow him from morning to night as he engages in various… let’s call it shenanigans for lack of a better word. It’s ebullient and fun and mysterious and moving and everything you expect from this author in a tale of this sort. “Oh come now,” Bast said gently. “A little sweetness is all any of us have sometimes. It’s always worth it. Even if it takes some work.”So very Rothfussy and required reading for fans of the author and/or Bast._____________________________________________Tough Times All Over is pure Abercrombie.“I know not how to convince you, for I lack the sweet words. It is a long-standing deficiency. But it would be best for us all if you gave it to me willingly.”“I’ll give you something willingly,” said Fallow, to sniggers from the others.The woman didn’t snigger. “It is a parcel, wrapped in leather, about …” She held up one big hand, thumb and forefinger stretched out. “Five times the length of your cock.”Javre and Shev by Raymond SwanlandIt’s been a while since I read anything by Joe Abercrombie. It’s just one of those things where your TBR keeps on growing and you neglect to reread some of your favourites and even some new books by an author you enjoyed. And that’s the situation I found myself in when my fellow blogger, TS , mentioned how much she was enjoying reading The First Law trilogy. Coincidentally, I felt like reading some Rothfuss and picked up the Rogues anthology to read The Lightning Tree when I spotted an Abercrombie short story in the same book. I could not resist. Tough Times All Over immediately felt like an Abercrombie tale, with the story following the viewpoint of a courier named Carcolf during the course of a very important delivery. She is taking no chances with the job and has arranged a decoy courier to attract all the attention while she silently slips away with the slender, foot-long, leather-wrapped package, but a trap has been set, and the parcel is stolen.And SWITCH. We are now in the viewpoint of the thief. This passing off of the viewpoint to a new character, sort of like passing the baton in a relay race, is a literary device I have enjoyed immensely every time I have encountered it which has always been in Abercrombie books. Of course, it would not be half as fun if not for the colourful array of characters used to progress this type of storytelling and that is as ever, a major strength of the author. Before long the package is stolen once again as we switch to an entirely different character, and then again and again. Turns out, EVERYONE wants this particular item and they want it BADLY.The story’s pace is quite brisk and really draws you in, with the parcel changing a large number of hands before revealing its final destination, and Joe Abercrombie does not disappoint with a delightful finish.A final mention for two of the characters that were each briefly in possession of the package, Javre and Shev. I felt like I could have read a whole book with these two as the protagonists.“That was with one hand.” She held up the other big fist, and had produced from somewhere a sheathed sword, gold glittering on the hilt. “Next I draw this sword, forged in the Old Time from the metal of a fallen star. Only six living people have seen the blade. You would find it extremely beautiful. Then I would kill you with it.”Interior art for the Subterranean Press edition of Sharp ends by Raymond Swanland
