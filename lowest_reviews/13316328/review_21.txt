Yet another witty read by Jasper Fforde! Although aimed primarily at younger readers, this book is very enjoyable and very Fforde: lots of great characters (Jennifer did remind me of a young Thursday Next), puns, jokes and inventiveness. Who else but Fforde could mix an evil multinational, media circus, crooked politicians and dragons in the same book? Granted, the book is short and the plot is a bit thin but this is still a great read. A very good Fforde:)• Book 2: The Song of the Quarkbeast ★★★★• Book 3: The Eye of Zoltar ★★★★★• Book 4: Humans vs. Trolls - to be released.
