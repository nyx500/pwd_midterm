"Magic, as I said, has no intelligence. The choice to use it for good or bad lies with us. All of us."Jennifer Strange lives in the Uninited Kingdoms, that's right, the Ununited Kingdoms, where she runs Kazam Mystical Arts Management. Soon, the few remaining seers are struck by the same powerful vision: the world's last dragon, Maltcassion, will die in less than a week, at the hands of the Last Dragonslayer. I fell in love with this novel almost instantly because of how darn funny it was! Jennifer is one of my favourite characters I've read so far. She's super opinionated, strong, smart and funny. Her pet dog/shark/animal sidekick Quarkbeast, is the absolute cutest, hilarious and scariest thing around. And he's always there for his BFF Jennifer.I have to say though, that the beginning of the book was really tough. There were so many weird names, and so many random details that I had no clue what was going on for a long time. Look at some of these:"There are three types of shridloo: desert, desiree, and dessert.""A red setter is so stupid even the other dogs notice, and cats aren't really friendly; they're just cozying up to the dominant life form as a hedge against society."Some of this stuff was really hard to keep up with but that quickly relaxed and things got much easier to understand. I just can't believe how funny it was! I could barely go a page without laughing. It features a delightful mix of magic and everyday absurdity. You will get hours of pleasure visiting the Ununited Kingdoms, riding around in the Rolls-Royce Slayermobile with the Last Dragonslayer. I highly recommend this to readers both young and adult.
