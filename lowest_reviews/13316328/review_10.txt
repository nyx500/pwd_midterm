The Last Dragonslayer has something in common with Disney movies; no, not the racism thing... This is a book for younger readers, but that I, technically an adult, really quite enjoyed... I don't recall any racism, just to be clear!I laughed, I cried, I didn't put it down, and as is Jasper's way, there were jokes that some might not get, but that keep those of us who read a lot, and enjoy a good sense of humour, reading and laughing.With a sassy 15-year-old, female lead, and an assistant named Tiger Prawns, you can see it's going to be a good time!The Last Dragonslayer is a story of fantasy, complete with magic and dragons, taking place in the present day, with phones, plumbing, and cars.Instantly a classic, instantly one of my favourite books, and I can't wait for the rest!
