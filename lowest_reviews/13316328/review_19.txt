So very, very, very good!Excellent! The narration was wonderful as well!This story is the perfect mixture of cleverness, craft, cute whimsy, intelligence, social commentary, fantasy, and fulfillment of the hero's journey trope.I loved! This author has a new fan :-)Haven't been treated to this good a story in a while. And so funny!!I'm off to Audible for part 2.
