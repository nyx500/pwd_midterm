3.5  Full Review Buddy read with fake Alexander What I liked - I loved that the book became interesting from chapter 1, instead of having a slow start. It made me interested in the book immediately. - I liked the Fire VS Frost storyline: Basically, there is a war against the firebloods (people who can control fire) by the Frostblood king. He pretty much kills all the firebloods he and his soldiers could find. I loved that the history about where the two groups came from was explained and also, why they hated each other.- Arcus, the love interest, was not your typical "hottest guy" character and I actually liked him better for that.  What I didn't like - This book had some YA cliches; like the mysterious cold, distant, love interest  That turns out to be the supposedly dead former king , and the 'chosen one' trope. Overall, this book reminded me alot of other books I have read. Anyways, it was a good book in general and I was never bored.
