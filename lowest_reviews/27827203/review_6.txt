DNF @ 37%I don't usually rate books I DNF unless I make it to 50%, but this book has me bitter...even though it's pretty much my fault. Still. I got drawn into the hype and pretty cover and so, I bought not only this book in hardcover...but also books two and three...Because IDIOT. Regardless, you can imagine how much I wanted to love and persevere through this thing and its successors. But alas, as much as I loathe wasting money, I just can't force myself to pick this book up anymore. It basically reads like every other YA fantasy romance you've ever read before, except SHITTY. I have read (and rated highly) many a cliched YA in my time, but this one just isn't cutting the mustard. The writing is blah, the characters are wooden and one-dimensional, and the magic system is non-existent. The only silver lining here is that I get to pare down my physical tbr by three books, albeit not via the avenue I would prefer. Thankfully though, I have since trained myself to stop buying entire series at once without first reading and loving book one. I still have a few unread series on my shelves which were purchased before said training took place, but hopefully I have better luck with those. Onward.
