I didn’t love it, I didn’t hate it. Neither was there a thrill to the story necessarily. I don’t know whether that has to do with the fact that this is a middle grade story or that I didn’t feel the excitement and thrill I’ve come to expect of Schwab’s stories. Everything seemed dimmed down, but I guess it had to be because the audience that’s being catered to now has changed. But even then, a story can still be enjoyed regardless of the supposed target audience. I guess in this case, the story just didn’t work for me. It felt bland, I wasn’t connected to the characters or the intrigue of the plot. I’m assuming it would be developed in the sequel but at this rate, I’m wondering whether I am even bothered to pick up the sequel.———————————————UK COVER YOU HAD BETTER COME THROUGH! 😍
