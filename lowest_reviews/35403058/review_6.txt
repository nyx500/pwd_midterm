”We all need someone who sees us clearly.”This was a really nice middle grade book and I enjoyed reading it.Of course there are no horrible plot twists or especially complex characters but this isn’t what the book aimed for and if you’re aware of this you’ll not only be fine but also able to savour it properly. ”My camera was on the bedside table, the purple strap frayed and the viewfinder cracked. It was damaged but not ruined, changed but not destroyed. Kind of like me.A little special.A little strange.”Since this was my first Victoria Schwab book I can finally say that I’m intrigued by her writing style. I don’t know how her other YA and adult books are but after giving “City of Ghosts” a try I’m convinced that I’ll like her other series as well. Because even though there didn’t happen a lot in this rather short fantasy book the writing style still kept me going and caused me to read on. Actually I’m kinda afraid that I’ll fall head over heels for all of her other books. If they have fleshed out morally grey characters and an intriguing story line I’ll be a goner before I can say: “What?” XD”Fine, seven,” I say as we reach my street, “but I get final approval. And no Batman.”He looks aghast. “You heathen.”As for the plot in this book: It was okay and a little bit predictable, but we’re talking about a middle grade book here so that’s to be expected. This said I really liked Cassidy as a character and I adored and loved her close friendship with Jacob. Those two were a lot of fun to read about and I can’t help but wonder what will happen to them in the next instalment. There was a little bit of foreboding at the end of the book so we’ll see what’s going to happen next. ;-) She throws her arms around me. “Embrace your strange, dear daughter. Where’s the fun in being normal?”I didn’t get warm with Lara but she’s not really a cordial character so I guess I wasn’t supposed to like her all that much. Cassidy’s parents were pretty kick-ass though and I loved the fact that they spoke about ghosts and were experts but didn’t even have a clue that their own daughter could actually see and talk to them. *lol* It’s an almost iconic irony and I was so there for it. XDHe looks up at the word ghost and clears his throat. “I prefer the phrase ‘corporeally challenged.’”If there was one thing I truly loved about “City of Ghosts” it's the way Edinburgh was described. It made me curious about the city and I’ll make sure to visit it one day. "Mary King's Close" sounded too fascinating to pass on it and since I’m a little history geek Edinburgh sounds like the perfect place to be. =)All told I thoroughly enjoyed this and I’ll make sure to read the second book as well. Before that I’ll jump into Victoria Schwab’s other books, though. I’m curious now and this curiosity needs to be sated. *lol*__________________________________Soo I guess it’s confession time:I never read a Victoria Schwab book! There, I said it. XDAnd now that I admitted this I’m finally going to change it as well. *lol*I don’t know if her only middle grade book is the best way to start with her books, but I picked this from a shelf at my library and decided to go for it.As far as I can tell there will be ghosts, haunted places and graveyards and after finishing “Lockwood and Co.” recently, this sounds exactly like the kind of book I need right now. Let’s hope I’ll fall in love with Victoria Schwab’s books too! =)(Because judging from all the reviews I saw, she might actually be able to become one of my fave authors.)Wish me luck! ;-)
