4.5 Stars!! Really really loved this book! The world building of the eerie little town of Sparrow was so good! I also loveddd the romance plot line. And there was a plot twist towards the end that REALLY shocked me. Overall this is a spooky, eerie, magical book about a cursed town and 3 sisters presumed to be witches. Not something I would normally read but I'm SO glad I did :)
