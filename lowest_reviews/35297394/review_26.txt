First off, this has a GORGEOUS cover. I love the legend and mystery of it. Penny has grown up in a remote coastal town, which has a population of barely anyone, except during tourist season, when people come to see if the ghosts of the Swan sisters, three sisters drowned in the harbor 200 years ago, will resurface. The problem is, every year when they possess the bodies of local girls and lead teenage boys into the harbor, people drown. This is one of the best YA fantasy books I’ve read this year. The author has a great sense of pacing, and this story unfolds in wonderfully rich layers. Every little turn and development as we watch the mystery unfold of who the Swan sisters will possess this year, and what they want. I won’t say too much more because I don’t want to reveal spoilers, but this was SO well written. A delightful romance, as well. If you like paranormal, a must-read. Please excuse typos/name misspellings. Entered on screen reader.
