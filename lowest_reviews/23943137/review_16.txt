Set in a Regency style Britain. An enjoyable and farcical magic infused romp. The author uses the language of the Regency period very well (says I, who gets all her ideas about Regency phrases from Georgette Heyer novels - therefore an expert!). It has similarities in tone to Novak's Temeraire series.The main characters suffer from the racist attitudes and gender inequality of the times as well as setting the magical world to rights as open to all, not just the priviledged. Sorcerers, magicians, witches, vampires, fairies, familiars, dragons, unicorns, mermaids- they're all here. Enjoy!
