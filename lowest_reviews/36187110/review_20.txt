Another book that I went into feeling lukewarm, but was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it.Firstly, the prose is lovely. It has a crisp and fresh feel, making it hard to believe this is a debut novel. There is a certain maturity to the writing that makes it seem like the work of a more experienced novelist. Secondly, the story is tight and well paced. Things move along very steadily, with clues to the mystery being revealed and the characters being developed in a way that feels natural and unforced.The m/m romantic subplot is extremely well done. Honestly, it is hard to write romantic scenes that give enough to the reader so they don't feel cheated while at the same time not ruining the moments with cringey writing because the writer is obviously uncomfortable (and/or unskilled/unpracticed) writing that kind of scene. The romantic scenes here were lovely, and set at the right temperature considering the rest of the book and how the scenes fit within the larger story objectives.For all that the story has many dark elements (magical bonding, oppression, murder...and worse) it maintains a surprisingly feel good tone. I wasn't expecting that, but I found I did appreciate it.Notes on the audiobook: this book ticked all the boxes I look for in picking an audiobook - not overly long, not so complicated that I can't follow the story listened to in sometimes short increments, and, most importantly, a good narrator whose voice engages me. The narrator here was fabulous! I would definitely recommend this as an audiobook if your criteria are similar to mine.
