I’m so sad to have not liked this book. I’ve read so many amazing reviews of it and had such high hopes. But alas, this was not my cup of tea. Swords. Bees. Books. Keys. Painted doors. Sea of honey. Owl king. Fate. The moon. Fortune Tellers. Cats. Is it an alternate reality? Is it the inside of a book? Is it the inside of a crazed mind? Is it magic? Is it aliens? I. Don’t. Know. 🤦🏼‍♀️ I held out hope all the way through that something would finally click for me... that I’d have a mind blown moment of ‘ahhh-haaaaa!!’ I get it and it’s fantastic! Unfortunately that just didn’t happen for me. 🤷🏼‍♀️ I honestly couldn’t wait for it to be over. It’s not the worst thing I’ve read. It has some spots but of intrigue. Overall I guess I lack the imagination to appreciate the sporadic whimsy this book offers.
