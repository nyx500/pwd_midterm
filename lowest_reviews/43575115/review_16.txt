DNFed @ 56%THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE YEAR!The writing is so abstract that I couldn't take it anymore! And the problem is I expected that, I wanted that, but it was just SO MUCH!I'm so sad right now, I really wanted to love this ðŸ˜­I feel this was a cheap copy of The Shadow of the Wind, even The Ten Thousand Doors of January to me was similar and better than this.I'm gonna crawl into a hole and cry myself to sleep now!
