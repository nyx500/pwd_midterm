I did not enjoy this at all. Pretentious, confusing and jumping through time to make no sense whatsoever..I feel like I wasted a reading week. All my anticipated releases have been flops this year.Now what is this book about? Honestly your guess is as good as mine. There was a hint of some love stories but they were so muddled into everything else that was pointless and made no sense so who knows. The plot got lost, the writing style was so saturated in metaphors and description I got bored and there was a million tangents that didn’t add anything to the story except make you forget the story. Our main characters had potential but that soon faded with the character arcs they were given. There are lgbt characters but even that can’t convince me to like this book.And that ending? That is some open ended bullshit for a pointless sequel if this one sells well and you cannot convince me otherwise, so unnecessary.Arc received in exchange for review.
