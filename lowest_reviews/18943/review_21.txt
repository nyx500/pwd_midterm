This was an all right story. Part prequel, part Cinderella retelling told from the POV of the stepsister. Iris is a strange and cunning child. After fleeing from the UK to Holland in the dead of night, Iris must help her mother try and make a living. They end up in the home of a master painter, before Iris finds a job as a servant to a wealthy family with a beautiful young daughter named Clara. I don't have a lot to say about this book because for the most part it was very okay. I liked the complicated relationship between Iris and Clara and how they both cared and protected Ruth. The ending was really fun, but overall I didn't care about the characters much.
