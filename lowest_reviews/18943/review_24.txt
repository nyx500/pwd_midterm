4.0 stars I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but it was not quite what I expected. For about half the book, there are very few correlations between the narrative being told and the fairy tale Cinderella, on which this story is based. Maguire spends most of the time developing Iris (ugly step sister), and Clara (Cinderella). My first experience with Gregory Maguire was Wicked (I never read it, but watched the musical, I plan to remedy this), so I think I expected more shocking twists and reveals. I was not exactly surprised by anything that happened, but it was an enjoyable experience. The writing is colorful and whimsical, and makes you feel like everything is sunny and warm, despite being a slightly darker version of the classic fairy tale. I think as I have gotten older I have started to reject the narrative that heroines must be pretty and talented, which is why Iris is so refreshing. I feel (except for some subtle adult content), this is actually a much healthier version of Cinderella for young girls. It teaches us that beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder, and that you do not have to be aesthetically pleasing to accomplish great things and find love. That beauty itself can have consequences, and there are better things to do than spend our lives wishing to be prettier, or thinner, or more talented. Thank you Gregory Maguire for continuing to challenge our perspectives.
