This book was laaaaaaame. I listened to it on audio and considered DNF'ing at least 10 times. Major instalove. Flat writing. Flat characters. The resolution was way too convenient. I did like the concept of the siren world and the Ocean being personified. I think it would've been better if someone else wrote this book. I think I might be done with Kiera Cass.
