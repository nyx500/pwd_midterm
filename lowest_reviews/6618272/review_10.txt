“Books were a safe place, a world apart from my own. No matter what had happened that day, that year, there was always a story in which someone overcame their darkest hour. I wasn't alone.”Ugh... I could NOT bring myself to finish this book. I. Just. Couldn't. I got 35% and had enough! It's such a shame because I absolutely ADORED The Selection series. 'The Siren' couldn't even compete! Clearly, this is just not for me lol. It was way too slow and boring and really I didn't even like the plot! The whole book was just bland and incredibly predictive. It was also 100% Insta-Love rubbish. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ *Read at your own peril*
