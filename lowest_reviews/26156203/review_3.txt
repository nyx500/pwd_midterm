wow, what an enjoyable story! this has been presented as ‘the night circus’ meets ‘imperial russia’ and it totally delivers in that regard. i am such a fan of russian history, so i think that was the highlight of the book for me. although the history was slightly skewed (as mentioned in the authors notes at the end), the story was so alive with culture. i loved it! as for ‘the night circus’ part, the only thing in common was that both stories focus on two people who find themselves in the middle of a competition to prove who is the greatest enchanter/magician. which was really fun! i love ‘the night circus’ with all my heart, so i was relived that i didnt find myself comparing the two books at all. this book had enough character of its own for it to stand up for itself. what i wanted more from was the writing. for being a book centred around magic, the writing felt so heavy and dull. i wanted to be whisked away by enchantments, by light and whimsical words, but the writing wasnt that at all. it didnt keep me from liking the story, but i think it would have been much more enjoyable had the writing style been a bit different. overall, a really good read and i cant wait to dive into the next book! 4 stars
