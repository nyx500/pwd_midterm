For the winner of the game, there would be unimaginable power.For the defeated, desolate oblivion.The Crownâ€™s Game was not one to lose.Awesome. Great. That's an excellent thing to keep in mind. Do. Not. Lose. Except someone forgot to tell the main characters cause nobody seems to give a shit about winning the game the instant their nether regions start tingling in the presence of the opposite sex.Having a Russian setting and involving magic, one cannot help but compare this to Leigh Bardugo's Shadow and Bone trilogy. For me, there is no comparison. I admit, it was not the greatest series, but it was interesting and it was entertaining despite the angest and despite the painfulness of the love triangle. If you think you can escape the love triangle here, think again, and this book is even worse because it's just so bloody boring.I used to write really long reviews for books, ripping them apart, criticizing everything that is wrong, but it just seems to tiring to do so these days because I seem to have the same fucking criticism for every quasi-high-fantasy that comes out. Every book has the same problems, this book is no exception. Insta-love. Romance over ambition and rationality. A recycled, boring plot. Acceptable but plodding writing. These days, I can't even be fucked to actually hate a book such as this because I'm just so tired of it all.
