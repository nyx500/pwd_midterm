I loved this book so much! I put off reading it forever because of some not so great reviews, but I have learned my lesson once again! Vika & Nikolai ♥ Vika & Nikolai are pitted against each other as the only two enchanters in Russia. They are to fight to the death to be the next Imperial Enchanter to the tsar. Well I think that's rude. They could both live! Pasha is best friends with Nikolai and he has no idea what Nikolai is until later on. Pasha is the prince but doesn't act like one. Pasha and Nikolai see Vika in the forest one day using magic. Pasha wants to find out who she is because he ends up with a little crush. I loved the feelings between Nikolai and Vika though. ♥ But what are they to do when one has to die? You have to read the book and see. I really hope with the ending, the next book is going to be really good and go the way I want it to go. Lol Happy Reading! Mel ♥MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List
