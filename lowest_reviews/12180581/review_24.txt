Buddyread with Melissa(re-read for me)Melissa's review here She couldn't get into it but its all good:)-----2.5 to three starsDidn't love it as much this time around but it was a nice trip down memory lane, so to speak.Some things that didn't annoy me the first time did in this re-read and in some instances the world building had me shaking my head.Don't regret reading it again but I think I'll be giving my copies of the series away now.
