Review also posted on my blog.I finished this awhile ago and am quite glad I decided to do so. There are plenty of suspenseful moments in this book which is why I kept reading bu there are also things lacking. One thing that got on my nerves was the lack of character building. I mean nearly all the characters felt like cardboard cutouts with no depth or personality. I found them hard to emphasise with. And another hing is I would have liked to know a bit more about the trolls themselves and what I is exactly that makes them more special than humans? I mean yeah they have magical powers that have been diluted over time and they "commune with the earth" don't like to wear shoes and sometimes have a greenish tinge but that's about all that's described oh and they leave their babies as changelings in rich families so that the rest of the trylle can have the money for medical care and a comfortable life when the channelling returns to the community.Another thing that bothered me was than Wendy HARDLY EVER stood up for herself when her mother treated her like shit and everyone else around her just expected her to know everything about trylle culture and forget about her home life. I was so frustrated at times I wanted to reach into the book and shake some sense into her. I just hope she becomes stronger in later books.I also would have liked to learn more about he vittra and why they are a violent sect of trolls and exactly what they want as this was unclear. But overall a good even read and a series I will continue in time.
