I never finished this book, actually I never finished the first chapter. I couldn't read this book it was like the author grabbed a thesaurus and picked out vocabulary that would have even made Jerome Shostak have to look it up!It made me hate the author...it felt arrogant, high handed and pissed me off.*shivers*
