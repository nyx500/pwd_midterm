Another rereading. Every time it feels even better. An impressive debut. This time I paid attention to Bakker's writing style. It is so detailed. So profound. So many proverbs, metaphors, parables giving so much insight and depth to scenes and characters. He has such a great grasp of the moment's distilled feeling. The way we experience and process what we perceive. So satisfying every time!First REVIEW:Grim, dark, bitter and humorless and yet one of the best first books I have ever read. The premise founded here is enormous. I cannot even imagine how epic Second Apocalypse might turn to be. The world building is incredible. Unparalleled. So dense and realistic and at the same time weaved in lore and history that can be compared to the likes of Silmarillion. The world materializes in front of you. Its ruins. Its landmarks. Architecture, costumes, scents, flavors, accents, people. Everything.The plot is based in the Crusades and feels historical but there is much more that comes from the background. Along with the characterization it reminded me of ASOIAF and Dune. The story is a study in human drama. Vanity, insecurity, fears, ambition, religion, tragedy, triumph, manipulation and so on written in dense prose full of gravity, introspection and at times philosophy. I understand why many people do not like these books. Much violence, injustice, sexism etc. Nothing silly or cheesy. Very realistic portrayal of pseudomedieval times. Not many likable characters and certainly none flawless. If you tolerate such context and want to experience a dark grandscope epic these books are a must!
