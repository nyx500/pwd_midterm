This trilogy is really crazy interesting. My friends and I have a category of literature that I enjoy, basically calling it "Lit grad student masturbation" (e.g. Cloud Atlas, Infinte Jest). Although it's mainly used in the perjorative, it also describes incredibly accurately the writing style, very heady, involved, and vocab intense. This is the first time I've encountered Philosophy grad student automanipulation, and it's enthralling, especially in the fantasy genre, where various philisophical schools manifest as types of magic, religion, and rulers. This is also an intense read. There is a ton of information unleashed on you, it's better to just set aside some real time to read it in depth and try to assimilate all of the aspects of the world, political factions, and characters involved.
