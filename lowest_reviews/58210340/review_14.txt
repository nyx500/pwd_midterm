dnf @71% I simply do not care.The magic system makes NO sense.Why are they universally known as 'monsters'? That's the only species label you could come up with?They steal time from people. Okay. But they can also time travel? ..Okay. But they absolutely cannot under any circumstances change the future no matter how hard they try .. Okay. But bringing technology from the future is prohibited because it could cause trouble in the past? ....Wait. Now I'm confused cause you already said it wasn't possible to disrupt the timeline. Now you're telling me technology is dangerous cause it could disrupt the timeline. Hmmmmmmm, I'm seeing conflicting stories in your narrative here, Vanessa. I'm confused.I dnf-ed cause I knew the ending wasn't going to raise the rating and I didn't want to waste time I could be spending reading a better book.
