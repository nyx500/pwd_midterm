I'm finding this review very difficult to write without spoilers so I will keep it vague. This book is squarely YA and starts with all the familiar YA tropes - cute boy, star-crossed lovers, etc. But then it takes all of those expectations the reader brings to the text and smashes them. Sorry, reader. Or, rather, lucky reader! This isn't the story you thought it was. It's better. Every time I thought I could predict what came next, Len used it against me to take the story in a different direction with a different outcome. I did think the prose was a bit clunky, particularly at the beginning, but the author did eventually find her footing. And there's time travel which I am sure could probably be scrutinized but I'm ok with authors playing fast and loose generally with time travel. (I'm not there for the physics; I'm there for the feels.) And that ending was, well, a real banger. Could have gone soft. Definitely did not. Kudos to Len on an excellent YA debut.
