5ðŸŒŸ this book was amazing and i loved every second of itif you loved the feeling of aaron warner in ignite me, the arrogant love interest in shadowhunters, and also forbidden love, bloodlines, family hierarchy of dramione fanfics, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. THE WAY WE HAVE FORBIDDEN LOVE FOR BOTH LOVE INTERESTS??"A Hunt and an Oliver together? How very Romeo and Juliette."HAD ME SCREAMINGi always feel stressed reading/watching time travel but this was done so well !! it was refreshing to see our MC on the morally grey side for once! we have one love interest that's morally grey and one love interest who is the hero, and the hero obviously has to get rid of the bad guys right?i was so intrigued by Vanessa Len's post about enemy soulmates AND NOW I UNDERSTAND."We believe that if people belonged together...then our timeline tries to repair itself by bringing them together. Over and over and over.""Like soul mates?"if that's not the most romantic line i've ever read...the magic system is amazing, the characters are so well developed, has great twists and turns, the pacing of the storyline kept me intrigued the whole time! it reminded me of Tahereh Mafi in her Shatter Me series, so you know it's amazing. i know it might be early to say this but i just know this is one of the best novel releases of 2022 !!
