I was really hoping I would love this book but I just didn't and I feel kind of bad posting this review üò£ The premise was interesting and unique, but there were a lot of things that I'm normally not a big fan of... which added up to me not really enjoying it‚ùå THE ROMANCE WAS kind of one of the big things advertised about this book but I personally did not enjoy the romance. Star crossed lovers is one of my least favorite tropes, there was barely any flirty banter or sexual tension, and it's always harder for me to care about a romance if the couple gets together early. The romance was also rated G... so generally not my jam lol‚úÖ I ENJOYED THE TIME TRAVEL and the different eras we were thrown into, which is rare because normally time travel plots are a complete shit show. But it definitely won me over hereüÜó THE CONCEPT OF MONSTERS being the main protagonists was also interesting, but I felt like the monsters were a little too *nice* and generally lame to truly be monsters. The only person that seemed more evil was Aaron, but honestly, that just made me like him more‚ùå MY MAIN PROBLEM WAS that this book seemed very juvenile and almost middle grade. The characters were sixteen-ish, which is already pretty young for me, but it kind of read even younger than that. I think that's partly why the romance and the "monsters" were so tameOverall, I think this book had a good concept but it just wasn't for me. It's definitely on the younger side of YA so if that's your jam then I would recommend it. But if you normally look for the more mature YA, NA or even adult books, then this probably won't be for you.‚ö†Ô∏èSidenote, potential spoilers** -- So I've been binge-watching Legacies on Netflix lately and this book definitely is giving me some Legacies vibes haha. Definitely interested to see how it ends up for Joan but I still probably won't read the sequel‚ö†Ô∏è
