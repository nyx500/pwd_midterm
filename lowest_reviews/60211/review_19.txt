Did I understand a lot of what happens in this book ? Not really Do I care ? Also not reallyReading this book was an unique experience which I enjoyed immensely.The prose of Gene Wolfe is amazing and I have come to the conclusion that I just love stories told by the protagonist reflecting on his life.The world is unique and I'm sure on a re-read I will pick up so much more. Now I'm just going with it and I'm enjoying it so much !
