My expectations were low given the author herself proclaimed it to be a “Slytherin Romance”, barf.(The speed at which I finished this book is irrelevant, leave me alone.)The main character was so infuriating I wanted to stab myself in the eye reading this. Also, the casual queer rep made no sense. If you’re going to do the whole oppressive society, at least commit to it. And why were the only gay people men? Strange.Alessandra managed to make leaps in logic, but at the same time made stupid nonsensical mistakes for the sake of moving the plot? If you have to double back on your characterization just to keep the story moving, it’s telling of poor writing skills. Yeah, this book was entertaining, but it was entertaining in the same way that watching a dog chase it’s own tail is. Should you maybe stop it? Probably, but letting it continue is far more interesting.
