this was so bad lmfaoooo i feel like the main character was a walmart jude duarte, she was very much a try hard badass. for example in the very first chapter it is explained that she killed her ex boyfriend, i was very much unamused because we didn’t actually get to see her do it so it’s just like okay cool? idk i just didn’t care.. very sad because the cover is so beautiful:(
