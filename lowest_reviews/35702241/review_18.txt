I received this complimentary ARC from the publisher, in exchange for an honest review.1) Woo the Shadow King.2) Marry him.3) Kill him and take his kingdom for herself.This gave me all the Cruel Beauty-vibes I've been craving and my favourite 2020 release thus far. I nearly read this WHOLE THING in one sitting with a grin on my face. It was SO GOOD. Morally grey characters who are so unapologetically bad...and I loved it. Do yourselves a favour and pick it up when it releases in February. This is my first book by Tricia Levenseller and it most certainly shanâ€™t be my last!
