The City of Ember is an engaging children's fiction novel that introduces young readers to courageous characters who take steps to make change happen. The author Jeanne DuPrau writes age-appropriate fantasy/dystopia with mystery, action, adventure, and an exciting cliffhanger that keeps kids interested in the series. My son absolutely LOVES this book! Loves it so much he doesn't want to watch the film adaption for fear of ruining his reading experience (he has learned this lesson early in life LOL). As soon as he finished reading his library copy, he took his allowance money to buy the book so he can own it (I'm SOOOOO proud!). I read this book along with him and I have to say it was pretty good! If you have a young person in your care that needs some reading recommendations, offer this title for them to consider! It is the first of four books so it should keep readers busy for a while.#1:The City of Ember#2:The People of Sparks#3:The Prophet of Yonwood#4:The Diamond of DarkholdThe City of Ember: The Graphic NovelInterest LevelGrades 6 - 8Reading LevelGrade level Equivalent: 5.1LexileÂ® Measure: 680LDRA: 60Guided Reading: WType of BookChapter BookGenreMystery and SuspenseFantasyTheme/SubjectFamily LifeCourage, Bravery, HeroismLeadership and ResponsibilityFriends and Friendship03/10/2015What do you do when your fifth grader tells you he's reading the greatest book ever and he wants you to try it?
