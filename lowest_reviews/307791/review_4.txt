Before The Hunger Games (2008) there was The City of Ember (2003).Well, that’s not exactly true because, to be completely honest about it, before HG there were the Japanese novel (1999) and then movie (2000) Battle Royale from which only the blind would say that HG isn’t based upon or at least heavily inspired by. Which, don’t get me wrong, is totally fine; inspiration comes in every shape and form, and if a great book/movie inspired HG author Suzanne Collins to write a great series, then more power to her and more fun to us readers. So all is good;-)Back to CE, the reason why I compare it to HG is because when it came out it was to my knowledge the first post-apocalyptic YA to ever hit the market. In that, DuPrau can only be praised for her originality and avant-gardism. But there the comparison ends. Because if you’re looking for poor kids fighting for survival in a beat-up world, look somewhere else. CE is not about that. At all. Rather, it is more about discovery (both self- and world-), about not taking the truth that’s given to us unquestioningly and instead go and look for another one despite all the obstacles along the way. So again, if you're looking for point-blank survival, full-frontal fights and gruesome deaths, you're not going to get it in this book. In this sense it is a very clean and very-young-reader oriented story, which, however, doesn’t fail to catch the fancy of older readers as well, and thus transcends all age groups. The two main characters, Lina and Doon, are very real, very relatable and very likable; the story is very satisfactory, if somewhat a little slow-paced at times; the writing is very easy-reading and will never make you scratch your head in confusion; finally, the ending is great and will make you want to pick up book 2 right away.Long story short, it’s a winner to me!OLIVIER DELAYEAuthor of the SEBASTEN OF ATLANTIS series
