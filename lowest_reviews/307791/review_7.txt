Very interesting and exciting. The City of Ember is a dramatic book and the three main characters, Lina, Doon, and Poppy find a dark tunnel where they find a box of matches. But they don't know what they are because they haven't discovered movable light yet! And I think it is very creative and if you want to know more, read The City of Ember!!!The mayor is actually behind some of the problems of Ember. Looper, Lina's friend's boyfriend, and the mayor are hiding rare things such as light bulbs, food like peaches, and lots of long gone things. Lina and Doon find out and tell a guard but instead get hunted down for spreading vicious rumors. But, they go through the dark tunnel and find a way out of Ember and tell their parents, and the three run away from Ember leaving one message.
