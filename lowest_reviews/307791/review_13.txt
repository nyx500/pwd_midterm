Overall Rating : B-"Ours is the only light in a dark world."This book got me out of a horrific reading slump so that counts as an extra star right?Definitely made for a younger audience but it still holds up on it's own merit. When all you know of your world is the city you live in and the dark unknown just beyond, two kids discover that there might be a way to save everyone when the lights start to fail. And in less than 300 pages, it gives you all of that and just a little bit more.Read this in elementary school and had to pick it up again when I saw it at the library. I might watch the movie as well, but you know how well they hold up to their counterparts so....A great book when you want to feel lucky you live out in an open world!
