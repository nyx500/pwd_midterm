FINALLY finished this one! Definitely amazing!Absolutely LOVED following Lina and Doon through Ember and their escape. Plotting, worldbuilding, characters were really excellent! Will most likely not be reading the prequel to this, but perhaps People Of The Sparks and the one after that! Note: WATCH THE MOVIE! It's wonderful and actually pretty close to the book as in terms of following the plot!
