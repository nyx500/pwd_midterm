It was unusual, a bit crazy, nut not my cup of tea, therefore 2 starts only. Although it doesn't mean that the book is bad - it's just very specific. Author created a fascinated urban legend with a bunch of hilarious parodies on cults and apocalypses. So I can understand why his novels are so popular, but it's not for me.
