In the city of _______, the end of the world is quickly approaching, instigated when a/an _______ gets stolen. Genero, the undistinguished protagonist, all of a sudden discovers a new world when he's ________ by a ________ and then rescued by a ________. It then turns out he is a hero sort, a necessary element of the battle between a ______ and a/an ___________.Jeff Vandermeer: Alright, Mieville, the name of a city. China Mieville: This will be a London sometin'. JV: Alright *writes it in* Now, we need a noun.CM: Ah. . . squid? JV: Sure. Why not. *Writes it in* Verb?CM: Kidnap.JV: Past tense?CM: Kidnapped.JV: *taps forehead with pen* You know, Mieville, I kind of like the idea of basing our next books off of Mad Libs, but I can't help but feeling like this particular storyline is just unavoidably plain. I mean, you could use this framework to generate The Dark Is Rising, or Un Lun Dun, or-CM: I AM CHINA MIEVILLE. I WILL MAKE IT WORK. JV: Profession?CM: Uh. . . gangster.JV: *Writes it in* The Lord of The Rings, even. I mean, this looks kind of Tolkeinish in its framework-CM: I'M CHINA MIEVILLE, BITCH. (1 year later. . . )JV: Hey, China, congratulations on Kraken!CM: Did you like it, Jeffy?JV: It was quite funny! Collingsworth was a terrific secondary character. And when you brought in that guy who figured out how to teleport, man, that was vintage. And so was the Tattoo. CM: Cheers, Jeff!JV: The idea of competing armageddons is a fun one. And you have the detectives over here, the friend over there, the protagonist here, and they all meet up at the end . . . it's a terrific way--CM: Yeah, thanks--JV: Of getting around a fair-to-middling plot. CM: . . . . .JV: And a dull, flat main character.(Mieville turns, looking out of the review at the reviewer.)CM: Where do you get off judging my book and giving it a star rating? Not to mention impersonating me, and claiming I said inane things.Michael: *Leaps back from his computer, startled* Uhh. . .hi. I'm a big fan.CM: Fuck you, a big fan! "Big fans" appreciate the elements that work in a book, they don't spend time nitpicking because it didn't reinvent the genre. You're docking me two bloody stars because it's a hero's journey?M: . . . First off, I don't give five stars to anything that didn't stun me with its brilliance. So, that's kind of like an "extra credit" number of stars. So, really, I'm docking you ONE for the hero's journey thing. CM: But you gave five stars to "The Monster at the End of This Book."M: So I did. Did you read Keely's review of Kraken? Did you pick on him?CM: He didn't call himself a big fan.Michael: Touche.Jeff Vandermeer: Do you still need me? Can I go home now?M & CM: Shut up, Jeff!M: It's just that I expect a lot from you. . . That's all. The Bas Lag books were technically speculative fiction, but they surpassed that, and I think qualified as literary fiction. Kraken is pulp fantasy, isn't it?CM: You say "pulp" like it's a bad word. I wanted to have some fun with the genre of fantasy, and write a humorous book, and I did both.M: Good job! Doing that gets you three stars from me.CM: WTF! Not that I care about how many stars you give me on your social networking site. What have you written?M: . . . . CM: Exactly. M: You don't have to shit on my self esteem just because I gave you three stars. We can still be friends.CM: Feast on my dung. I'M CHINA MIEVILLE, BITCH. I REST MY CASE. *Returns to his blog.*JV: *Shrugs* I don't know what to tell you. M: Somebody's having a bad hair day. I mean, you can't fill your book with stock characters who never develop, follow a traditional pulp storyline, and expect to write something that moves your readers deeply. He HAD some good ideas in the book that made it a very entertaining read. But I can't give him extra credit for being China Mieville, right? You see what I mean?JV: Last time you wrote a review with me in it, you had me murdered. Don't expect sympathy here. M: Yeah? Well, my reviews are sometimes violent. It wasn't personal.JV: *Shakes his head and goes back to Ambergris* M: I guess there's a downside to being a meanspirited cynic who disses books all the time. I mean, really, books are my closest friends. Because real people are such assholes.Harold Bloom: Maybe you're just using book reviews as a way to avoid working on your real writing project. Perhaps you're afraid this novel will turn out to be less edgy than you hope for, and that fear is making you find ways to avoid working on it. Perhaps your rough treatment of China Mieville is really the result of your own insecurities.M: Goddamn you, Bloom. If this is going to become a review of ME, I'm fucking leaving.
