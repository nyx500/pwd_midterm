This book is crazy.Now, either China Miéville writes your kind of crazy or he doesn't. If you read this book and think "This is crazy...but it kind of makes sense," then you're good to go. However, if you have to ditch it after 100 pages because all you can think is "WTF?", then this book is not for you.What makes it difficult is that Miéville tends to plunge you into his crazy world and hopes you'll hold on long enough to start to enjoy the ride. He's not big on info-dumping or exposition. Reading one of his books is like being slammed into by a blowback from an explosion. My best advice is to just "roll with it" the first time you read it, kind of glossing over anything that you don't understand, and then re-reading it to really let everything fall back into place and coalesce in your mind.Billy Harrow is a 30-year-old scientist who works at a museum. One day the giant squid specimen disappears. Who stole it? Why?This book gets heavy into cults, religion, and evil. There's magic. There are gods. Like Stephen King, Miéville writes a dark world but includes hope, goodness and even a touch of humor to it. He's not depriving you of all hope.This takes place and London and is heavy with British slang. Not only is it dripping with slang, but also with Miéville's special crazy language that he uses in his books. And a ton of difficult, reach-for-your-dictionary vocabulary. So it is not an easy, breezy read. This is a PROJECT. But it's a book worth reading, in my opinion, as long as hard-core, take no prisoners Science-Fiction/Fantasy appeals to you.I liked CITY AND THE CITY better than KRAKEN, but they both deserve 5 stars, in my opinion.P.S. I would just like to note that coincidentally the main character's name is Billy, and he does turn into a Billy Badass by the end of the novel. Which I found a wee bit of a stretch, seeing as he starts out as a mild-mannered scientist, but I went with it.
