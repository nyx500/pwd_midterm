A Chinese Folklore tale, told using such dreamy words!My second by this author ( I loved The Night Tiger). I really enjoy her writing style. I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre, but in her hands it was a success. The ghostly, creepy and strange worlds she wrote about created the most atmospheric journey. I found myself captivated and wanting to keep listening to one more chapter.The four parts include Malaya in 1893, Afterworld, The Plains of the Dead, and MalaccaA marriage trying to be arranged between a dead person and a living person so a spirit might be placated. There is also plenty of suspense, shrieking, ghosts (and hungry ghosts)!, shadowy forms, demons, fairies and ox-headed creatures, YIKES!I listened mostly, read a bit too. Narration was by the author and was amazing! Around 12 hours long.I recommend, but ONLY if you enjoy fantasy, imaginative world-building, supernatural and a tad of romance.
