This was really good!! 🤩🤩 It definitely had its issues, but I could mostly ignore them bc I just had such a good time reading it 💜“We are not defined by the things we do in order to survive. We do not apologize for them,” she says quietly, eyes never leaving mine. “Maybe they have broken you, but you are a sharper weapon because of it. And it is time to strike.” Ash Princess follows Theodosia, who is the princess of a magical kingdom- but then the Kalovaxions invaded, murdered her mother and took her captive. Theo now lives as a captive, ridiculed and abused by the Kaiser and his court. But after 10 years, Theo is tired of taking it lying down- she is finally ready to stand up and fight, save her people, and reclaim her crown.“I was a princess made of ashes; there is nothing left of me to burn.Now it's time for a queen to rise.”Tbh I have seen quite a few negative reviews for this, so i wasn't sure if I would like it or not- but I actually ended up enjoying in!! It's a very enjoyable YA fantasy ✨Starting with the characters!! I really liked Theodosia as our protagonist- she is the classic 'strong female' YA protagonist, but it honestly never gets old. Loved seeing her finally stand up and fight back and I was rooting for her 🙌 Otherwise, tho, the characters were kinda bland... They were all a bit underdeveloped tbh 😬😬 But I did find Crescentia, Theodosia's friend at court, to be a very interesting character with complicated motivations. She definitely had lots of layers.I really like Laura Sebastian's writing- it was very easy to read and a nice balance between simple and descriptive. It was just very enjoyable and tho it wasn't anything particularly new, I liked it a lot 💜💜The plot was pretty good, even if it did have a few problems. I really liked the main storyline and it was executed well. Always love a good rebellion story and I was a big fan of all the plotting going on in here ✨ I just love it when characters do lots of scheming- definitely my Kaz Brekker side coming out 😂😂 The climax was always very entertaining and the ending was pretty well done 😁However, I do think it could be a bit slow at times and there was a lot of sitting around and just talking about what they were gonna do, which did lose my interest at times. Also, I wish the romance was more of a subplot 🙁Now, onto the romance. There will be definite spoilers in this section, so don't read on if you haven't read this book. Just keep reading after the 'spoilers have ended' sign.🚨SPOILERS🚨There were 2 primary romances in here and a little bit of a love triangle going on- and I still don't know how I feel about these romances. I'm still processing tbh. But anyway, starting with the romance between Søren and Theo. At the beginning of the book, when this romance first started developing, I was a fan. Love a forbidden love moment 😍 But then it went downhill... I thought Theo having to kill him would be a great way to build tension and get that Jurdan 'hate and feeling' vibe, but then it started feeling like Theo was just manipulating Søren and that didn't sit right with me 😬😬 I dunno how they as a couple would get redeemed, but they do have chemistry, i gotta admit. Then there was also that romance with Blaise- I'm honestly not a big fan of this one. It just seems honestly veryy bland to me 🙈 There was no tension and Blaise himself felt like quite a boring character. I think they do have potential as a couple, but right now the tension isn't there for me to be shipping them 😒😒🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨I also listened to a playlist for this series on Spotify and that really enhanced my reading experience!! So here are a couple of those songs for anyone who's interested.🎧 Songs 🎧Human- Rag 'n' Bone ManDark Side- Bishop BriggsGlitter & Gold- Barns CourtneyThe Other Side- RuelleWalk Through the Fire- Zayde Wølf (feat.

The red stain I used on my lips looks like fresh blood. Underneath, I see bits and pieces of my mother staring back at me, but twisted with hate and fury my mother never needed to know.I'm not sorry for it.I am angry.I am hungry.And I promise myself that one day I will watch them all burn.”Overall, I had a lot of fun with this! 🤩🤩 I would recommend if you want:✔ Fun YA fantasy✔ Rebellion✔ Love triangle✔ Fierce female mcNot sure yet if I'm gonna continue the series, but this was definitely entertaining 💜~ 3.5 stars ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I really enjoyed this!! 🤩🤩 It wasn't incredible or anything, but I still had a lot of fun reading it ❤❤
