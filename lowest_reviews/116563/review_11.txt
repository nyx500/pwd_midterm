Having reread Deep Wizardry and just read Games Wizards Play, I'm absolutely fascinated by how she has managed to keep all the threads running from this very first book, which is . . . what, forty years old now? This is the first face off with the Lone Power, the repercussions of it are still coming. My kids (I read it aloud to them) loved the living helicopters and cars (the youngest) and the science based magic (the oldest). Such a treat (for me) to revisit it again after I don't know how many years!
