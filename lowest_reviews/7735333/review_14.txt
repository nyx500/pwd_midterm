WHAT MADE ME READ THE BOOK?It's a trailer I watched on Youtube, and I was intrigued about it.Matched TrailerAt first, I thought it was just another best friend-loves-best friend-loves-new guy thing. I was right, but not what I expected. It got better and better as I read more.(Note: If you think like a writer, you'll know something that might happen.)The plot reminded me a little of Hunger Games (perfect/imperfect Society, rebellion) but it's still great.In the middle of the book, I just then noticed that blue eyes, blonde hair = Peeta, black hair, dark blue eyes = Gale. And then I dismissed the thought. How can I like something if I keep comparing it to others?The characters:Cassia, the protagonist, is not annoying, thank goodness! She's not a damsel in distress. As the story progress, so does her character. She changed into a strong person which made the story more interesting.KY. What can I say about him? A mysterious guy who keeps everything to himself, but when he and Cassia get to know each other, we learned about his story. It's not a lot to take in because he gave it piece by piece.Xander, the best friend. First, I really really liked him. I thought he was perfect for Cassia, for the Matched. They don't need the microcard because they already know each other. I still liked him until the end, but I prefer the main guy.A lot of talking; less action.I like the writing style; it's beautiful . The words blend together perfectly.KY and Cassia have a perfect chemistry. The way their love story blossom, oh so sweet â™¥I don't want to live inside this book. Creepy. They don't have a choice in whatever they do.Ms. Ally Condie did a great job with this book!The ending is quite fast. I can't wait to read Crossed!
