Bitch, puhlEAz! This book is just a crappier, romance-oriented, version of the Giver, and I didn’t even like that one! It has the whole, "We are a perfect Utopian society, with order, and control. Yeah, we don’t tell you much about who we are and what we do, like ever, but none of y’all have turned into Tin-foil Hats, so just continue on with life, and do as we say. Cheerio!” At 16 (I think it's 16, I’m too lazy to go check), there is this Matching ceremony, where teenagers are paired by the government to become... mates? Thanks Sarah J Mass. You’ve taken over my vocabulary. What next? My life decisions?? Anyways, home girl Cassia, gets matched with her best friend Xander and is all like, "Yippy! I am gonna have a great life, and live happily ever after!" But when when the idea of a different guy being an option comes into play, things turn into, "Oh dang, sorry Xander, but I'm droppin' yo' ass! Even though I don't know much about this new guy, other than the fact that he likes drawing in the dirt, like a 3 year old."I actually only read like maybe 70 pages of the Giver, but I got enough of the gist to recognize that this book is just an unoriginal copy cat. *insert Billie Eilish’s Copycat* Such a badass-bitch-song! ....Could totally be my theme;)
