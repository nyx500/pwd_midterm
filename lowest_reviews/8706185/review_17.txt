Among Others is a wonderful character study, a coming-of-age tale about a girl with an unusual and tragic past and unusual beliefs who is thrust into a foreign and somewhat hostile situation, the decisions she makes, and the friends and family she finds along the way. There are a lot of references to fantasy and science fiction literature and fandom, which I enjoyed very much. (I agreed with the assessment of most of the works mentioned, very intelligent assessments of Zelazny and Heinlein and Silverberg, and I have to find a copy of the Ace double that has Delany's Empire Star to see if the B side is as bad as Mori thinks.) The reader is left wondering through much of the book if there is really anything supernatural happening at all or if it's just her interpretation, but by the end we realize that the important part of the story is Mori's journey. The story is set from September of 1979 through February of 1980 at an English girls' school, but the comfortable writing style pulls you in almost immediately. It's a very thought-provoking book with a somewhat abrupt ending that can be interpreted in a number of ways, but it seemed to me to fit quite well. As she would say, Among Others turns out to be really brill.
