"I'll take Heinlein over a headmistress any day."Jo Walton's Among Others is a very entertaining book that follows Morwenna's coming of age (through iconic science fiction and fantasy) with her diary entries from 1979-1980. While it was enjoyable, I often felt there was a lack of plot moving things forward. Morwenna's love of books and her reviews of so many classic scifi/fantasy titles wasn't always enough to keep things going (as much as I loved that aspect of the book as it prodded me to read more classic scifi--yes, that is Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers in the list of books I'm currently reading). This seemed autobiographical and I am totally good with that. I also liked Morwenna's connection with the fairies. I would just liked to have seen more of the story line and especially for the ending (which I think worked) more context. However, the story getting us to that point was not as developed as her love for scifi. Overall, though, I really enjoyed and am glad I read Among Others! 4.25 stars“If you love books enough, books will love you back.”
