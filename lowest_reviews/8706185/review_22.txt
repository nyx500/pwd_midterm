WOW! This really was something. It is the daily journal of a young teenage girl, surviving twin daughter of a Welsh witch, a girl living in 1979 Britain with the father she did not know and about to be sent off to a boarding school "among others".This young 15 year old is both younger and older than her classmates and is above all a reader, a passionate book lover....especially works of science fiction and fantasy. These books keep her soul alive when life is too hard and come to bind her to others.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys those areas of reading. This is also a very different take on developing responsibility, individuality and maturity (if that doesn't sound too stuffy, for this is anything but a stuffy book).I'm going to have to read it again to make note of all the books it references. Of course there are Tolkein and Asimov, Heinlein, Dick, C.S.Lewis, etc. But there's also Plato! and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And Mori speaks such tributes to libraries and librarians!! They should be published in newspapers. I guess I'm in love with this book right now. Thank you, Jo Walton.
