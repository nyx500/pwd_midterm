I loved this book to pieces! Simply because it made me feel so good inside while reading it - it hit my heart spot on. I love that this is what I would call "light" fantasy mixed with magical realism that contains fairies. I also absolutely adored the main character, Mor, and the way she feels excluded from everyone and also has a limp. Mor was amazing in so many ways: Her reading habits were phenomenal and made me want to read a lot as well. She also made me want to visit my local library a lot more than I already do. I absolutely adored the setting of the boarding school she attends even though it's portrayed as a cold, desolate and lonesome place. However, that only made her trips to the town library and the caf√© so much better. Every time Mor had to go home to her father I wanted for her to go back to this magical town of books, coffee and intertextuality :) This book comes with a lot of references to other books which I found interesting. Only once was I partly spoiled for a book that I might want to read later on in life, but it didn't matter because actually it only made me want to read that book even more. Mor has an amazing hunger for books and I could identify a lot with her. I do see why some people would be disappointed in this story if they were expecting a magnificent fantasy story. I wasn't expecting anything and maybe that's why I ended up loving it so much. During the last pages I was dreading the end because I didn't want to leave Mor, and that's a sign that this is a great story worth reading!
