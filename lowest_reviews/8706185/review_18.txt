There are few problems I had with the book. First, as far as fantasy goes, I'm not really a big fan of the magical realism type of fantasy like this book is, I like to be transported into a new world with great world building. Second, I'm also not a big fan of geek nostalgia like this or Ready Player One. Third, I thought there could have been more to the book than basically about discovering the genre.The book is about a fifteen year old girl who gets send to boarding school after the death of her twin by her father. It is basically seen though her diary as so goes to school from 1979-1980, and finds herself discovering all the classic science fiction/fantasy, but mostly science fiction since fantasy was still growing though the inter-library loan at her local library then discussing it at the library with the science fiction book club on Tuesdays, which is in part autobiographical. This book is partly autobiographic of the author, and to many fantasy/science fiction lovers of the genre including me, which what makes up most of the book. The discovering/introduction to the genre when one is a teenagers, then trying to read all the genre has to offer in one sitting. I did that when I got out of high school, discovering all the new books by using the inter-library loan at my university to get all the books I found. Also this is the story of how one can be awkward during the teenage years in the process of discovering what is the real reality of life/world.I read this book because there are many discussions about how great this book was by many in the science fiction/fantasy community, and it even won this year's Nebula, and its nominated for the Hugo. I don't see/understand the hype in the book.After all this what one positive thing I have to say about the book is that it is a great way for people to introduced to the genre because there are many titles of books within, even though its out of date, and mostly science fiction because of the time.
