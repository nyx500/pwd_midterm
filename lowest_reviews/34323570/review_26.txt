Mini review: I received this E-Arc via Netgalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review. My ‘Wish’ was granted. DNFI was highly anticipating this book! A friend of mine had given it a positive review and it sounded so good! Unfortunately it wasn’t good. The prologue was fantastic! There was murder and general excitement. While yes pretty much everything was spoiled I didn’t mind it. It gave me a reason to continue. It went downhill from there. Both women annoyed me. I felt that the point of view shifts weren’t really done that well. It came to a point where I was just skimming to see what would happen next. That only lasted so lasted for awhile, then I just lost interest. Eliana read just like Aelin from Throne of Glass. I only liked Remy, Eliana’s mother, and Harkan. While Rielle was more bearable to read about, she also became boring. Overall this was an utter disappointment. I do not recommend.
