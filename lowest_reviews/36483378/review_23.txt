From my first review I saw that I wasn’t mind blown with the book, so why I decided to reread it is besides me.The magic of the world Owen created and the castes were the only interesting thing in this book for me. The story was good, however I didn’t connect to the characters, and that made me feel indifferent about all of it.read december 2019↠3.5buddy read with Laura Interesting. That’s the word that followed me through the whole book. I found The Merciful Crow interesting, but it never passed into me really enjoying it.The writing was good and the world was phenomenal. I really liked the different castes and the magic system, that’s the only thing that really stood out for me. The characters were well developed. Fie was a memorable character and a badass, even though I didn’t connect to any of the characters I was really impressed with her. Tavin was great, he came from the higher castes but also he understood the Crows very well and the fact that he’s funny one always is a plus. Jasimir…oh, boy… His character went through a lot of growing; from being an ignorant lordling whom I wanted Fie to punch to someone who may even be a friend to her and fight for Crow’s rights.
