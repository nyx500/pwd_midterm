Full Review I was drawn to this book by it's cover but I'm glad it was an enjoyable book too! What i liked - The plot/magic system: I found some aspects of the storyline to be unique. For instance, the MC belongs to a group of people called 'Crows'. When someone dies of a plague, they are the only ones that can get rid of the body, but the people in the town that the person dies in has to pay the Crows to prevent the plague from spreading and killing everyone. Also, the MC doesn't have powers on her own, but she can borrow the powers of others using their teeth. - The writing: I enjoyed how this was written. There were some recurring themes which made the book easy to follow.- The friendship: I enjoyed the bromance between the Prince and his bodyguard, and how protective they were of each other.  What i didn't like - So the people in this are divided by groups named after birds. You have the royalty, called Phoenix , Then the royal bodyguards who are called Hawks . The Crows  are the least important group. The were other bird groups too and the problem was that sometimes, I kept thinking the author was talking about an actual bird until i continue reading and realize that the bird was actually a metaphor. I wish there were less bird metaphors- The middle part kinda got repetitive after awhile. The same action plot kept happening over and over again, with the same groups of people.Overall, I enjoyed this and I think it's a good debut book from an author.
