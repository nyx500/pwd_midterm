A bit silly but a lot of fun! I have already enjoyed several books in this author's Parasol Protectorate series and found this one to be nearly but not quite so good. However I see that the next three books in this Finishing School series all score over 4 for their Goodreads average rating. That cannot be bad so I guess I have good things to look forward to.I like steampunk and I usually like Young Adult books so Etiquette & Espionage worked for me. The main character, Sophronia, is fourteen but acts much older and for most of the book I forgot that the characters were children. Special praise goes to Bumbersnoot, the mechanimal. Everyone should have one. Especially with a name like that.Altogether an entertaining book which did not take long to read but which passed the time in a very enjoyable way.
