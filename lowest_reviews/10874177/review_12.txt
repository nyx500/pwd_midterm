Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êGenre: Fantasy + Young AdultEtiquette & Espionage is the first book in the Finishing School series. The story is set in 1851 and is about this fourteen-year-old brat, Sophronia. This teenage girl is giving trouble to her mother with her mischievous acts. Her mother wants her to become and behave like a proper lady. The mother enrolls her brat daughter in the Finishing School of a French lady called Mademoiselle Geraldine in order to be the lady she wants her to be. It turns out that this school has some other purposes besides teaching the students the arts of dancing, dressing, and etiquette. Sophronia will make some friends there and finds out that after all, it is not too bad to learn the other unexpected skills that this school specializes in. I have no idea who recommended this series to me. Although this is a young adult book, it felt more like a middle grade. I have some mixed feelings about it. I feel the pace of the story was not steady. Sometimes it was fun to read and other times it was just boring and snoozefest. Maybe the presence of the occults will make the next book better. That‚Äôs only a maybe. One aspect I liked about it is the machineanimals. These are mechanical pets that are present in the plot and have some major presence. The book is a mixture of fantasy, steampunk, and historical fiction so it is supposed to have more rich content. But being a young adult that tends to be more a middle-grade story made even the characters lack the depth that I was hoping for. I didn‚Äôt feel connected to any one of them. If I didn‚Äôt own all the four books in the series, I might‚Äôve stopped here. But since I have the books I will still read the whole thing because I promised myself not to unhaul books unless I read them. At least this will be a kind of punishment for me not to buy a whole series without reading the first book! üò´. I am still hoping that the other books will be better. We‚Äôll see.
