I found this first book to be extremely entertaining. Filled with mythological and folkloric motifs, mixed with plenty of steampunk settings, and stirred with non-stop action, I devoured this novel in (almost) one sitting. Arthur (the asthmatic, unlikely hero) was well-developed and loyal as was his equally heroic sidekick, Suzy Turquoise Blue (she’s my favorite). Everyone else was dubiously trustworthy for various reasons and I can’t wait to journey to Tuesday to find out. There were also numerous religious overtones within but I didn’t find them to be stifling or overdone. I would recommend this series to teens or older middle-graders as there was some pretty deep philosophy here as well relating to being and nothingness. Overall, this was a stellar, exciting journey.
