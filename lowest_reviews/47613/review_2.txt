The one where dangerously asthmatic Arthur gains possession of a clock hand that embroils him in a conflict with supernatural agents -- one that takes the form of a strange journey in one realm, and a deadly plague in another.This was wildly original and yet also boring, which takes some doing. Part of the trouble was the writing, which was often clunky and weighed down with unnecessary details. Part of it was the plotting; sometimes the rules and complications were just right, but other times they seemed arbitrary, put into place just to create some suspense. ("The dinosaurs couldn't get in, but now they can, because he's changed the boundaries!" "Can't use it until midnight! What if I don't wake up in time?") Arthur gets involved in the supernatural doings in a way that's even more accidental than it usually is in these kinds of books -- the object is quite literally put in his hand by someone he doesn't know, and after that happens, he lets us know that he's often gotten in trouble in the past for his curiosity, something that we saw no sign of until a motivation was needed. I realize that the rules of POV are a lot stricter in slash than they are in regular fiction, but the POV shifts here really bugged me; 95% of the book is told in Arthur's POV, and so it's really jarring when we go out of it for three paragraphs just so we can learn something that Arthur doesn't know. Maybe they get better as the series goes along, but I don't think I'll be bothering. (2007 Locus poll: Sir Thursday #5 YA SFF)
