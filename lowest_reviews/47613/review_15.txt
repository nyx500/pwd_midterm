Yeah, this one did not live up to my expectations. Maybe if I was like 10 years old this would have been a fun and interesting read, but for me, it was just boring, and this coming from someone who generally enjoys YA. I won't be continuing the series. To be honest, the only reason I even tried to finish it was because I needed it for a challenge.
