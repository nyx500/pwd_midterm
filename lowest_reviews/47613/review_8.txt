4 stars!This is one of the books which I thought to be boring at first and set it down to read some other time. And months later when I picked it up again I was up all night! So I guess it basically depends upon mood. I definitely want to continue with the series.The world the Garth Nix has created is eccentric , peculiar and full of surprises. It will surely take your imagination to next level... I loved the concept, which was definitely unique and highly creative and the characters were great too! Especially Suzy! And Will!Until it took a human form I always thought of it as "he". Lol!Some might say that the series is for children but I enjoyed is nonetheless.(My favorite genre currently is YA though.)I'd definitely recommend it. At least give it a try.
