If Harry Potter had been raised as a fundamentalist Christian, and someone gave him LSD, a story like ‘Mister Monday’ by Garth Nix might result. Especially so if he studied the myths surrounding King Arthur (originally an English Christian myth).Even though I thought the fantasy elements were whimsically fun and interesting, most of the characters are disguised heroes and villains from the Bible. Although apologists try to make the case the author was using tropes from Joseph Campbell's world mythology books, which I have read from cover to cover - twice - I felt as if I was reading a more intense Nardia adventure with more overt and complex biblical imagery. All Christian beliefs came from older religions. The Bible is a collection of stolen stories from older cultures around the Mediterranean Sea. It seemed to me 'Mister Monday' includes only those religious tropes which were stolen by Christianity from the older religions. The book is aimed at 9-12 year olds. Christian kids probably adore the book. But I do not believe this is a general world myth introduction for kids.
