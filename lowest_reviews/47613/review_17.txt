This was a decent book, but it didn't really capture my attention. I think listening to the audio didn't help in this case as I kept getting distracted by a million other things. Arthur was a decent narrator and I liked him a bit since he reminded me of my younger brother with his asthma problems. I also haven't read many books with a main character having asthma so that was different and unique. The world that Arthur falls into, was weird and strange. I liked it but I didn't really understand how it worked. Again I think this is because I had a hard time paying attention. I liked Leaf and I was happy she tried to help Arthur when he collapsed from asthma. I wanted her to be more involved than she was. At least Arthur makes allies in the other world. I was glad that Arthur wasn't a push over, the villains kept trying to steal the key back from him, but he didn't give in. In fact, he got help and came up with a half plan to make things right.
