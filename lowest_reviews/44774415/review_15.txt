➖This book will be published 15th October 2019➖〰️My very first graphic novel and I adored it〰️This book is so up to date with life. It has queer witch who is very hard of hearing. Which makes it great to read as it’s a disability that prevails many (even if they aren’t a witch!)And a Chinese/America werewolf. How awesome is this to introduce nonbinary characters.Nova also has two Grandmothers who are in a relationship with each other.I felt this layout around Nova was absolutely great. In today’s society we need more acceptance of people’s life choices that are personal to them.And the Invisible parents just knocked my socks off, I was in awe of the imaginary with the help of powerful illustrations in this book.These are good witches. It’s all around nature too which impacted on me.Who could have foreseen I’d love this book.This has opened a doorway to me to look into graphic novels more.Loved reading this on my iPad however I feel I’d have enjoyed it even more so in physical book format.It has a young love story running through this which I thoroughly enjoyed.Suitable for Young adults to teens.But Adults May love this just as much.
