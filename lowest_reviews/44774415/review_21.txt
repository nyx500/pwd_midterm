Ok, things I liked:The art style was really beautiful, and might I add, quite original. Plus, I did enjoy the supernatural elements of the story, style wise.Things I did not like:The characters were bland and boring, not well realized at all, and I didn't care for them (I don't think we actually know anything substantial about Nova and Tam, besides that the former wears a hearing aid and the latter is non-binary). Although Nova's grandmothers have potential, as they are delightfully quirky, they are merely side characters and we mostly focus on the romance between Nova and Tam (boring). The plot was muddled at best, oddly paced and at most times didn't make any sense. Generally, I found it to be quite a superficial read, without any real depth, which is precisely what prevented me from giving it a higher rating. I'm just sad, because I love witches and I expected to love this story too -well, I at least hoped it would be entertaining.
