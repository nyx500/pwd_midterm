The Unbroken is an unflinching look at the brutality of empire, and the insidious ways that it colonizes people's minds as well as bodies. Touraine and Luca are both terrific characters, and their relationship has as many twists and turns as the political machinations of this book. The portrayal of internalized oppression in this book is super powerful and intense, as Touraine returns to the country she was stolen from as a child, only to discover that her people are not the savages she's been taught they were. What I loved about this book is Clark's ruthless dissection of the notion of loyalty, and whom we choose to give it to. Touraine is somewhat loyal to the empire, but her real loyalty is to her fellow native conscripts, and this ends up getting her into all kinds of trouble. Meanwhile, the reader is constantly rooting for Luca and Touraine to be together, and Clark uses this to make us realize how both characters are part of oppressive systems. This book is brutal and unstinting and upsetting, and so worth it.
