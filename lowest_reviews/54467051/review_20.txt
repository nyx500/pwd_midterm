Video Review (Spoiler Free):  https://youtu.be/R1p5iGqUevI Re-read thoughts:  I Still love this book so much and jumped right into my arc of the sequel after completing this. Touraine is just everything, I love her <3Alright I was not expecting to love this one as much as I did. On paper I was really apprehensive because this is a low magic, military fantasy that focuses on an occupied territory going through rebellion and none of those are my buzz words BUT I loved it. I was extremely impressed with how all the themes were handled and woven into the story. I love the messiness in everything, especially the main characters of Touraine and Luca. It was a book I could not put down. For me this was an action packed roller coaster form beginning to end (although be warned that some people found the beginning slow so take my experience with a grain of salt). Although the ending wraps up the story well I am very excited to read the next installment whenever it comes out!
