I finished The Wolf and the Woodsman just over a week ago and I haven’t been able to think about anything else since. I genuinely have severe brainrot from how much I loved this book. This is an atmospheric slow moving fantasy that’s Hungarian inspired and full to the brim with Jewish folklore. I loved how magical reading this book felt, how it wrapped me in its folds and didn’t let go of me. How eventhough it is slow paced, it is never boring. Full with tales and magic at every word. It’s also stunningly written. Ava Reid is a master wordsmith. I adored the way multiple belief systems were able to coexist. And how every single one of them was intrinsicately linked to magic. And how it inevitably shaped the way said magic materialized.All of that is great and would have made me love the book regardless. But. But the main reason this book gave me such a severe case of brainrot is the romance. It’s enemies to lovers, full of relunctance and angst, and messy complicated feelings. The scenes between the two main characters made me go feral, truly feel unhinged. Which is a feeling I completely forgot about when it comes to ships in books. No one is doing it like Évike and Gáspár. This book set a zhole new standard for me and what I want my romance to look like in Fantasy.
