I thought Kaye, the main character of the first book, Tithe, had a difficult childhood, but it was nothing compared to this. I wonder if Holly Black had a difficult childhood too. Most of the book follows Val and her friends Lolli, Dave, and Luis who live in a disgusting, abandoned subway station, while they are high on faerie drugs all day. Val even starts acting like Alex DeLarge at one point when she breaks into a family's home. Lolli kills a cat at one point because she is just tired of taking care of it. There is also cutting and casual sex among friends. So just be warned it might not be for the very young.The best part is Ravus, the troll Val falls in love with. Ravus is extremely sympathetic. It was hard to get an image of him in my mind but I gathered he looked basically human, except with slightly green skin and large teeth. Val's narrative never described him as handsome, but she did say he was tall and lean, with gorgeous yellow eyes and long, silky black hair. I really enjoyed his character, although he was way too good for Val. Roiben was actually in this one for a bit near the end, and Kaye was mentioned to be in the room, but we don't see her. I know the next book, Ironside, is about Roiben and Kaye again, but I don't know how important the events in Valiant will be to that story.
