6/13/19 update:*weary sigh* This is still by far my least favorite Holly Black book. This was by far my least favorite Holly Black book. Too much drugs and not enough faeries for my tastes. But I’m going to read book 3 because it’s about the same characters from book 1, whom I adored. Why we had this second book about completely different characters is beyond me, but I basically hated this.
