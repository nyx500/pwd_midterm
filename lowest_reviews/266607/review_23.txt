4★ |“I would remain nearer you for what time there is.”“Gone in one faerie sigh,” she quoted.“I can hold my breath.”Loved how Holly ended this story. I'm noticing the insta-love pattern of the fairytales in all her old books, but it's not bad? I love it, tho I might be biased. Remember how in fairytales, the prince and the princess met and just knew they were meant for eachother, or how in Barbie movies, love at first sight seemed beautiful and not something too unrealistic?Well, idk if you got my point but I loved all that as a kid and I'm loving all these stories by Holly as a grown-up too.As for the "not-so-insta-lovey" books by her, she did the slow-burn thing so well in The Folk of The Air. (an all time favourite ❤️)Tithe 3.5★Ironside 3.5★
