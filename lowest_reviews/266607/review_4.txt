It was a bit of a shock when I opened this book and the story wasn't about Kaye?? I assumed the whole series was about her and Roiben. Anyway.... this book follows a girl called Val. Certain things happen in her life and she runs away from home to the city. There she meets other lonely souls (homeless kids) and ends up staying with them in the subway. Through these new friends of hers she finds out about the faerie realm and ends up becoming a delivery girl of sorts for a faery and helps him discover who was poisoning the other faeries in the city. I really liked the mystery element of this book and I was curious about who the murderer could be. I just think the story took a very long time to pick up.
