This was painful to read, I'm not even sure how I got through it. Usually I quite like Black's writing, but this one I just couldn't get around. While I liked Tithe, although I didn't love it, Valiant follows a completely different set of characters. None of the characters seemed particularly likeable or developed, and things really seemed to just spiral from one thing to the next without much explanation, skimming the surface. Even characters' relationships just seemed to constantly flip flop from one chapter to the next..
