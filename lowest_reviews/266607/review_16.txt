It's like a dark fairytale for adults.After running away to New York City. Val finds herself with a bunch of other homeless runaways. She soon discovers the existence of Faeries and a troll called Ravus. Now Faeries are being poisoned and the prime suspect is Ravus. It will be up to Val to find the truth and save him.So I did like this book. It kept my attention and I was curious about what happened next. I love the Fae lore and how they make it tie in with a modern setting. I'm really hoping her next book takes us deeper into the actually Fae territory though. I'm not a fan of the characters though. I like Ravus. That's about it. I didn't dislike Val, but I didn't like her either. I don't know if I've just reached that age where I can no longer relate to teens, or if it's just this particular character. I honestly didn't like any of the side characters that much either. I would not recommend this for any one under 18.*Content Warnings*Runaways, severe drug use, sexual content, swearing, violence.
