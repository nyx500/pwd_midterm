I think my main problem with this book is it offered up too many questions but provided me with very few answers. And the answers I did get felt lackluster and somehow too easy. Instead of the intriguing, magical tale, I was promised I got a lukewarm story that never seemed to settle with me properly.  Sad to say, because I am a fan of Ms. White's other works. But this was just not for me. Guinevere's relationship with Arthur was also a mixed point for me. They clearly value and respect each other a lot. But it was not the romance I thought it would be. She had more chemistry with Mordred than she did with Arthur. And the so-called betrayal felt inevitable from the start. Basically, the book was just a big bag of a disappointment for me. I received a free ARC copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Big thank you Delacorte Press for providing me with a copy!
