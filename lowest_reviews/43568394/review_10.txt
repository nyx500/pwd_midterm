2 StarsSigh.I love the Arthurian Legend and snagged this immediately when I saw it as a Book if the Month YA choice. I was really excited at the thought of Guinevere having magical powers and being sent to protect Arthur for once instead of simply being the damsel in a distressful love triangle. And while I do appreciate the effort made here to make female characters strong and with agency...I felt the Feminist underpinnings and what seems to be the constant need for “representation” in every book these days (while appreciated) overwhelmed everything else. And the story suffered for it.The characters are all quite bland, especially Arthur. And, we are kept in the dark regarding many details for far too long. I became bored waiting for something to happen. We spend the vast majority of the book watching Guinevere flail aimlessly about, seemingly without any true purpose. When something finally does happen, I found myself not really caring.  I was also kind of disappointed in the magical elements of the story. I guess I just expected...more.
