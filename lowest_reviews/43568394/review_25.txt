I was sad to give this one a low rating, because it's not particularly bad. It was a nice enough read, with lovely descriptions of Camelot and a fun take on Arthurian legend. But I have to admit, I was expecting something more. Based on legend full with knights, magic, and more, this book felt like it should've been a fast-paced, action-packed, whirlwind of a story but ultimately went by quite slowly. It takes until almost exactly halfway for any real event to happen, and when things do happen, they rattled through almost too quickly in comparison. I also just couldn't help but feel like the plot was largely oversimplified, much more so than needed. The beginning seemed disordered, with information being revealed -or not - at whim, and I had the strangest realisation that I almost had to rearrange the information I had just read in order to understand it properly. It did even itself out as the book progressed, though the rest proved a simple story. Everything you needed to know was laid out to you on a plate. There was barely any nuance with characters. Nothing was really open to interpretation. It made it an easy read - definitely not a bad thing - but I would've like it to be a little more, considering the epic scope legends usually bring.Add in the simplification of relationships - i.e. Guinevere deciding she loves/mistrusts people two seconds after meeting them - and I just didn't really feel much for this book. As I said, it was a nice enough read and I wouldn't say its outright awful. It builds the world of Camelot pretty well and lays out some interesting tweaks to the original legend. But sadly that just wasn't enough.
