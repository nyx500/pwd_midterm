Where’d my socks go, Kiersten? You knocked them the hell off!Have you ever seen Merlin the British tv series with Colin Morgan? It’s from 2008 to 2012, an older show but I found it in 2015 on Netflix and all five seasons became my life! I’ve always been intrigued by Arthurian legend, ever since childhood with Excalibur. But that level of intrigue went to new depths when I discovered Merlin. Before this, I had only read one other of Kiersten White’s amazing works: The Dark Descent of Elizabeth Frankenstein which I was instantly obsessed with. So when I caught wind that she had a freaking MERLIN retelling up her sleeve I was beyond stoked! AND EVEN BETTER, I WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN THE FREAK AWAY Kiersten White, I could kiss you! But if we ever meet, I’ll ask first, and most likely I just opt for an awkward side-hug, but you get me! New favorite author here!! This lady right here! I could not put this down! It was pouring rain for days in California which is soooooo rare that it was truly GLORIOUS, and I had a nasty cold, which meant bundles of blankets, heaps of steaming mugs of lemon tea and me in my bed with The Guinevere Deception for an entire day and despite being so ill, I was in heaven with this book! Kiersten White writes incredible characters. I’ve only read two of her works so far but I’ve come to the same conclusion with both. Her characters are what I want in YA. Her storytelling is what I want in Ya. Layered and deep and unique and not everyone’s cup of tea. BUT IT’S MY CUP OF TEA. I must admit, that while this retelling was fantastic, she did my boi Merlin some wrong. Hahahaha. But, it’s not a deal breaker. I just can’t not see Merlin as the precious cinnamon-roll boi, Colin Morgan as Merlin in the tv series! Honestly I couldn’t help but picture Colin Morgan and Bradley James and Angel Coulby as Merlin, Arthur and Gwen. Ugh and I literally squealed when Lancelot graced the pages! Come and stan with me when you read it. I’m shook, yaaaas Kiersten, yaaaasss. Which reminds me, okay so Merlin was done wrong (only to those who stan the tv series 😆), but holy freaking Excalibur, my new boi, MORDRED got a freaking spotlight. I’m in love with Mordred. With Kiersten White’s Mordred. I knew it upon his initial introduction in the book I was like ooooooo, Imma be all over you, I know it. *gasp* Omg is he my Cardan rebound?! I’m such a book slut. I need help. I don’t go over plot. I’m more of hype-style reviewer because I like to go in blind when I read and choose a book over other people’s incoherent reviews full of squeeee’s and *gasps but I must warn that this is a slow moving plot. But it was done just so well, the world building and the character building, while it was slower, it was still unputdownable!What kind of sorcery is that? The power of a damn good writer that’s what!Another fair mention is that there may be a bit of a love-triangle thing going on here. But it’s NOT like your typical YA trope love-triangle. It’s not like sappy-pining, the main character doesn’t swoon over handsomeness, features aren’t even brought up, and it’s not insta-love. And it’s NOT a romance-driven plot. I’d say it’s more like....there’s two potential “love” interests, and the main character—naturally—chooses to explore those options, getting to know the persons and, maybe or maybe not, making a decision to start a relationship or not. Sounds about real life to me. I had a library copy. But I am high-key going to run out or click my way to procuring my very own copy because I want to personally support Kiersten White by doing so. I think that says a lot. Update! I got a signed exclusive Owlcrate edition!! Woohoo! August 2019:Omg omg omg!!!! One of my all time favorites is Arthurian Legend ever since childhood! And I’ve been soooo empty since the ending of my precious Merlin tv series 😭😱. And Kiersten White?!! *faints*
