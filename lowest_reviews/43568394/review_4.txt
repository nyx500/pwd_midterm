i am the kind of person where, once i find something i really enjoy, i practically obsess over it. and i think my newest obsession is arthurian mythology because, oh my gosh, this story is everything i never knew was missing from my life. im pretty sure i saw disneys ‘the sword in the stone’ when i was a kid but, beyond that, i know absolutely nothing about merlin, king arthur, camelot, or the knights of the round table. but this story is making me want to drop everything and read anything about them that i can get my hands on. even though i dont know much about the mythology this story is based on, i can tell that KW truly made this story her own. these characters and their personalities feel original to her/this story and i could really empathise with them and their development throughout. i am very excited to continue this series and i cant wait to see where it goes! in the meantime, please send all of your king arthur recommendations my way! :P↠ 4.5 stars
