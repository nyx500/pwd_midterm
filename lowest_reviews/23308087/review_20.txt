Ren√©e is an auto buy for me, so after screaming, I immediately downloaded this and started it.I love Mariko right from the beginning. She's so smart and so strong, but she's unaware of her abilities. It was delightful to see her figure out her potential and place in the world. The members of the Black Clan are interesting and quite the enigma. I loved seeing their truths revealed.I did struggle with the names and that is my main complaint. Each character seemed to have several nicknames, official names and titles and they were all thrown around. Often in the same paragraph. Eventually I sort of gave up trying to keep people straight.The plot is a bit of a slow burn, but it's captivating. I was sucked in right from the start. The ending is enraging and satisfying and I can't even wait to see what happens next.**Huge thanks to GP Putnam's Sons and Edelweiss for providing the arc free of charge**
