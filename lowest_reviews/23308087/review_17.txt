EDIT : I reread this book and I still enjoyed it but not as much as the first time I read it. I used to give it 5 stars but I changed my mind and gave it 4 stars instead. "If I am marching to my death, then I will march to it as a girl. Without fear." This book is about a girl named Hattori Mariko, whose convoy is attacked by the Black Clan, when she is on her way to the palace to meet her future husband, the future husband she does not choose and love. She is supposed to be dead but she survives and now, she wants revenge. She dresses as a boy and then she wants to find out who sent the Black Clan to kill her and why this person wants her dead.My OpinionOH MY GOD. I didn't expect this. I didn't expect I would love it this much. I didn't expect the pain that I would suffer when I finished reading it. I swear, I thought about this book a whole night, last night, because I just couldn't forget how amazing it was and how it caused me a great pain. I shed tears several times over the beautiful and powerful quotes in this book. The quotes are both beautiful, powerful and great at the same time and I found myself nodding and agreeing to these quotes. There are so many quotes that I love in this book and my copy is full of sticky notes. These are one of the quotes that I love : "There is such strength in being a woman. But it is a strengthyou must choose for yourself. No one can choose it for you. We can bend the wind to our ear if we would only try." Fear kept her alert. She would always let it feed her. Neverlet it consume her. and there are still so many more quotes that I love so much that I won't put them here, because you need to read the book to see these quotes. But believe me, the quotes are so beautiful and powerful. The PlotI LOVED THE PLOT. Honestly, I can't decide whether it's slow-paced or fast-paced. I mean, there are many things that happen in the book but when I finished the book, I felt it was so fast. But I also think it's slow-paced because I got the chance to know the secondary characters and the MC. Sorry if I'm being confusing hahahaha because I honestly can't decide about the pace of the book. for me, it felt both fast and slow paced. AND THIS BOOK MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD. THAT RARELY HAPPENS. I cannot tell you the story because it might be spoiler and I don't want to spoil anyone, But I laughed several times while reading it. Most of the time, it's the banter between Mariko and Ōkami. They're just so funny and I can't help but laughing or grinning, when they bicker.The Romance"My heart knows your heart. A heart doesn't care about good or bad, right or wrong. A heart is always true."I TOTALLY LOVED THE ROMANCE. THIS IS THE KIND OF ROMANCE THAT I LOVE TO READ. It is enemy-to-lover and for me, it didn't feel rushed or forced to happen. It was sweet and romantic and IT WAS SLOW BURN AND NO LOVE TRIANGLES. THIS IS THE KIND OF ROMANCE THAT I ALWAYS LOOK FOR IN BOOKS. The MC and the love interest took time to know each other and they eventually developed feelings for each other and it happened slowly, not instantly and by the time I finished this book, I got these feelings that one day, I want to have a man that look at me and think about me the way the love interest look and think about Mariko. I just don't know what else I have to say about the romance, other than I loved it and I SHIP IT. I hope to see more of the love interest in the second book. I CANNOT WAIT TO READ IT. I HOPE THE SECOND BOOK WILL DESTROY ME. I love to be destroyed by books. The Characters*inhales* *exhales* I COULD RELATE SO MUCH TO MARIKO. I swear, when I read this book and I felt like I was looking in the mirror, because I could relate to Mariko so much and Mariko was an amazing character. She was brave, fierce, strong, clever and determined. Look, even though I could relate to her very much. I wouldn't be as strong as she was. Maybe I would weep. Everything she had been through was beyond what I could bear and she was strong and fierce to deal with these problems. Honestly, I want to be just like her. AND OH MY GOD. THE BROMANCE AND THEIR LOYALTY TO EACH OTHER. OH MY GOD. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF IT. I NEED MORE. THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS LOOKED FOR IN BOOKS. Basically everything that I have always looked for are all in this book and I am so glad that I read it. This book is beautiful and the quotes in this book are purely beautiful and powerful. I love them so much. "I believethe stars align so that souls can find one another. Whether theyare meant to be souls in love or souls in life remains to be seen." ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨Review to come today! All I can say now is, my heart is utterly severely broken.---------------------------------------------- I've been feeling sad and bitter for a few days because everything that I have read so far disappointed me. So I hope, it won't happen with this book. I REALLY NEED a book that leaves me in awe.
