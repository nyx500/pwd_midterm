So good. So precious. So beautiful.If you are wondering, yes, it is like Six of Crows with The Da Vinci Code and National Treasure sprinkled on top ( I bet you were wondering exactly that) I loved this. A lot. Here is a brief description of the characters:Severin: The only similarity between him and Kaz is that they're both thieves and well the "leader" of the group. Severin is very VERY caring and he also laughs a lot(?) but he isn't as smart as Kaz. I still love him though.Laila She dances a lot. Tristan Oh do not get me started on this gem. He is the youngest and most precious of all the people and I just adore him so friking much!Zofia I don't know what she does exacty but she's always in a laboratory. She doesn't talk much but when she does, it's just long intellectual sentences so kind of like Ferb from Phineas and Ferb ( I know, awful comparison. Forgive me)Enrique Witty and charming. Good guy.Hypnos Just a guy in desperate need of friends.This book is just brilliant. If you haven't read it already, you are missing out big time.
