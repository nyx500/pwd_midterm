I am very impressed. The thing that stands out to me the most is that the writing was both beautiful and engaging. I enjoyed the main character's arc, the f/f romance, the rebellion aspect, and the class politics. The ending and epilogue were great! Felt like a movie.Audiobook: Above average, highly recommend!tw: I would especially caution readers about the focus on sexual assault. The main character is forced into life as a courtesan that she wants no part of. To the best of my knowledge, here are the specific chapters to be cautious of...Chapter 7 - forced nudity and an implied invasive medical examChapter 14 - Forced nudity and sensualityChapter 15 - attempted rapeChapter 16 - beating/violenceChapter 29 - rape (not described but led up to)Chapter 35 - beating, violence, drowning, eye trauma
