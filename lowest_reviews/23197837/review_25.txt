I loved the synopsis of this book and couldn’t wait to get into it. I really liked Camellia. She’s smart and loving and inquisitive. I loved that she made her own decisions and didn’t just trust blindly. The relationship between the sister Belles was sweet and I wish we could have gotten just a bit more of that. There are a lot of characters in this book, but everyone was fairly easy to keep track of. Plot wise, it was captivating. We’re thrust into this jewel and candy colored world and even though there were some repetitive scenes, I was never bored. At times I was remind of THG with some of the titles and fashion aspects, but it was quite unique. My only complaint is that I went into this book thinking it was a stand alone, only to find out when I finished that it’s a series. The ending is mildly infuriating, but there’s a great set up for the next story.Overall, the characters and world building intrigued me and I’m eager to see what’s happens next. **Huge thanks to Freeform Books for providing the arc free of charge**
