Content warning: minor fat shaming, negative LGBTQIA+ tropes, torture of humans and animals, unhealthy beauty standards.This wasn't bad and I will probably read the sequel, but this isn't the type of fantasy I prefer. It has an underexplained magic system and extremely narrow world building. It didn't really live up to what I wanted as far as commentary on beauty standards either.Audiobook review: I really enjoyed listening to this but honestly that's probably due to my audio addiction because the narrator read every character besides the main character with either syrupy sweet childish voices or voices that sounded like she had her mouth stuffed with marshmallows.
