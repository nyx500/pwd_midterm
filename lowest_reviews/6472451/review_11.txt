Lesbian Cinderella!!!!! This was a great and simple and a lovely twist on a classic fairy tale! Sidhean is a creeper and the hundreds are a great twist. I really really enjoyed this book it does an excellent job melding the feeling of a classic fairytale with a more modern style. And i would love too read more by Malinda Lo.
