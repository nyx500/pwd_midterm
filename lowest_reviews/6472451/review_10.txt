4.2 out of 5 stars.❝It’s smart to be afraid of things that smell of death.❞Ash is a queer f/f retelling of Cinderella set in a fantasy world where homophobia doesn't exist.What the Book Is Really AboutThe author, Malinda Lo, described it best herself:❝Whenever I’m asked what Ash is about, I say that it’s not about being gay. It’s about grief and love, and these are emotions we all experience, regardless of sexual orientation.❞The author’s portrayal of grief doesn't feel like fiction, it feels real. It truly tugged at my heartstrings—I really enjoyed her writing.The romance in this book is nice, but I do wish the characters' romantic relationship would have been explored more. If the romance aspect had been done slightly better, this might have been a 5* read.Also, the book's pacing is quite slow. Personally, I don't see that as a bad thing because I don't mind books that are very slow-paced. But I know a lot of people prefer fast-paced books so beware.One thing I really loved about Ash is the ending. The last two pages and the last sentence of the book, in particular, were fantastic. I loved the ending! I would have loved the ending even more if there was an epilogue though :') Honestly, I just want to see more scenes of the main character being happy and in love. Is that too much to ask for?OVERALLAsh is a really good book—it just fell short of the mark. If the romance and the ending had been a bit more elaborate, it would have been a really great book. But, alas, no book is perfect.As it is, Ash is still a groundbreaking book, especially for its time. It was released in 2009, and back then it was one of the few queer books published by one of the "big five" publishers. This was truly a mould-breaking book, and that's exactly why I picked it up!
