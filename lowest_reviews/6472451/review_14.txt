Ash by Malinda Lo is definitely a beautiful retelling of the classic Cinderella story - writing-wise. Lo creates an eerie yet fascinating atmosphere with her lyrical prose and the setting is described in rich details. She interweaves fairy tales and traditions of her own into the story and creates a world the reader can immerse himself in.Additionally, Ash is clearly more than a simple retelling; it adds aspects to the original tale and has quite some twists readers probably won't suspect in the beginning.Nevertheless, the â€“ in my opinion - most important aspects, the characters and their relationships, lack depth and I never grew particularly fond of Ash nor did I really understand the motives behind her decisions. The reason for this is clearly the fairytale character of this book: the writing seems distant - it tells a story from far away: long spans of time are covered in short passages and a lot of scenes lack dialogue and - simply put - feelings. All these aspects made it impossible for me to really connect with Ash, the huntress or the fairy prince.Ash definitely is a great book in terms of writing and setting, but for me it's still the characters that make a story what it is. With this one, I missed the certain something that would have made it an unforgettable read.
