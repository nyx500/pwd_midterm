my goodness, but this was fun.by the time I started worrying that the twisty subterfuge would drain the story of momentum I looked up and realized I'd practically inhaled this badboy to the 70 percent mark. and then some shit went down and my heart was pounding in my throat.meanwhile, this edition has a trio of follow-up stories at the end, so 70 percent turned out to be 90 percent. bravo!a lush, layered, ingeniously taut melange of gripping skullduggery, sword fights, bisexual escapades, and even a perilous courtroom drama for shits and giggles. my only complaint would be the fate of Michael, whose arc does not receive a satisfying conclusion.other than that, tho?booyakasha!
