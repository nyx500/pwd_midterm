People keep talking this up as "a fantasy of manners", but for that to work, you have to have actual wit and snappy dialog and someone to root for. I only made it about half-way through but to that point, Swordspoint is devoid of anything or anyone likable and the conversations are, at best, desultory. The only byplay you get is laboriously highlighted by the narrative voice, all subtlety wiped out by neon-like description and color commentary/analysis.And the characters are all mean, in a completely venal kind of way. And I'm pretty sure every male character is gayâ€”or at least bisexual. I mean, it's one thing to give us gay-perspective main characters as a kind of affirmative-action, hey, isn't it great how tolerant we are kind of gesture. But when some of the worst people in the novel are abusively homosexual and even the hero is, at best, graciously negligent, you have to wonder if you aren't rather harming your own cause. If gay were a pepper you'd add for flavor in a story, then Kushner has unscrewed the cap and dumped the whole canister over the meal.I can't see how this novel received the praise it has. Unless everyone is so busy showing how tolerant they are that they forgot to look for actual wit and character development.
