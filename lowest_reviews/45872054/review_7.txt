This Review ✍️ Blog 📖 Twitter 🐦 Instagram 📷“I am going to tell you a story you already know. But listen carefully, because within it is one you have never heard before.”When I started reading this book, I remembered why I used to enjoy Marie’s books so much! The writing at the beginning of this book is just superb! Marie is an awesome author who is one of the few unproblematic authors and that’s why I like reading her works!There are many things that I am to blame for: The fact that this is YA which I am not interested in as much as before now! The fact that it is historical fiction which I am not a big fan of! The characters were good and prodigies (I read all Marie’s books and all her MC are prodigies) but this time I can understand that because it was not far from the truth!I really enjoyed the feminist side of the book and ended up learning a few new facts about the Mozarts and I was really surprised by the fact that there were 2 musical prodigies!The book is not as action-packed or dark as Marie’s other books are but if you are a fan of the genre or music in general then I think it is worth giving a chance!You can get more books from Book Depository
