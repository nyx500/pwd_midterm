I really enjoyed this multiple POV low fantasy story. This was the first Daniel Abraham I've read, although I've enjoyed his work in the writing duo James S.A. Corey. The characters are diverse and although it's seldom the case in multiple POV books, I found myself invested in all of them. I usually have favourites and not-this-one-again's fairly early in a series of this sort, but that didn't happen this time. I found each of the main characters engaging and interesting enough that I was always happy enough to read their chapters when I got to them.I thought that the growth and change in some of the characters was very well executed and I look forward to seeing what trouble they get into next. I particularly like the idea of seeing into the truth of things and found this an interesting part of the tale. (Vague so as not to spoiler). I'm looking forward to reading on in the series soon!
