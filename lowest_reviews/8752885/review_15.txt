Probably the best new fantasy epic in 2011. I already read and liked The Long Price quartet, but Abraham has upped his game in this ambitious project. The influence of George R R Martin I think is clear in the grand scale of the world, the low but powerful magic that is more a dark threat than an active presence, and most of all in the careful development of the main characters and in the unexpected / brutal twist in the storyline. In the interview at the end of the book Abraham also mentions another favorite series of mine as an influence : The House of Nicollo by Dorothy Dunnett.Indeed the focus of the Dagger and Coin series will be the relation between the military mindset (destruction) and the mercantile attitude (the builders of civilization).The writing is self-assured and unobtrusive, pointing to a mature writer capable of keeping all the balls (POV's) in the air, and while I have my favorite in Cythrin, there wasn't any main character to turn me off the narrative. One slight peeve is that everytime magic is actually used I am strongly reminded of Obi Wan Kenobi and I expect the wielder to say " These are not the droids you're looking for!".I would have liked to know more about the history of the world and about the 12 humanoid races, but the first volume was already long enough. I only hope these will be revealed in the next book and not left obscure as in Malazan. I also hope the next book will be out soon, preferably next month.
