I absolutely loved Daniel Abraham's fantastic Long Price Quartet when I read it a few years ago, so I'm quite surprised it's taken me so long to start his other major fantasy series, The Dagger and the Coin, of which this is the first volume.I'm happy to say I enjoyed this every bit as much as I did the LPQ books... perhaps even a little more!The world-building is superb; you really get a sense that this is a fully realised world and that there's so much more going on outside the parameters of the story you're currently reading. History is one of the main themes of the book and, appropriately, you can feel the history of this world lying just beneath the surface of the current events.Another thing that makes this world feel real is the economics... no, wait, it's not as boring as it sounds! As you can probably infer from the title of the series, money is another of the main themes of the series and the author actually makes the economics of this fantasy world absolutely fascinating and key to the central plot. It made me realise how most fantasy novels don't deal with money much other than to have it as the treasure at the end of the quest. In this world, it makes things seem a lot more plausible to see how the more day-to-day financial affairs are run.That's not to say it's devoid of action and adventure; far from it! There's plenty of the old stabby-stabby and quite a few 'OMG' moments that had my jaw hitting the floor.I also fell in love with virtually all of the characters. I spent most of the book thinking to myself 'Geder's definitely my favourite character... no, wait, it's Cithrin... no, no; it's definitely Wester...' and so on. I'm SO happy there are four more books in this series and I don't have to say goodbye to these characters just yet!Overall, I absolutely loved this book and would highly recommend it to any fan of the fantasy genre. Now, on to the next one...
