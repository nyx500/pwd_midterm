So all throughout my life, society, the media, and my peers have indoctrinated me with the opinion that PASSENGER SUCKS !!And honestly I was  SOOOOOOOOOO  hesitant to start this book bc everyone knows I can‚Äôt handle another slump in my tragic life and slow pacing is not my best friend HOWEVER comma its was actually pretty decent. (s) Pros-	TIME !!-	TRAVEL !!-	Historic fiction owns my soul and it was bloody gorgeous -	Nicholas Carter -	The world buildings is üòç üòç-	I LOVED TRAVELING TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN DIFFERNET TIMES-	we could have used it more often tho-	while the first 60% dragged a bit the rest was engaging -	the cover is so pretty I want to dieCons-	don‚Äôt we all just LOVE an extra bought of insta-love in our lives??-	Too much kissing for being relatively foreign to each other I mean STRANGER DANGER KIDS-	Like she literally knows this guy for 2 days and shes willing to GIVE HER LIFE FOR HIM-	the pacing is slowwwwwwww-	THE CHAPTERS ARE SO BLOODY LONG WHO ALLOWED THIS-	too much descriptions involved, makes it difficult for attention to be held-	the ending made like 0 sense ???-	her mom pisses me the hell off-	also I wish the whole time travel thing was explained better -	had LOADS of potential but it just came off as v confusion  rather than well developed-	THE BOOK IS HEAVY man, like my arms were crying while I was holding it-	Guess who‚Äôs skipping her workout today?I‚Äôve heard that book 2 is MUCH more entertaining and so this is why I pushed through and binged this book bc I need the cover of book 2 in my lifeAlso all my buddy reading partners ditched me and im forever hurt by their betrayal (s) ‚ÄúIt's our choices that matter in the end. Not wishes, not words, not promises.‚Äù3.5 stars!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Buddy read with the valley girl, my enemy, the enemy's accomplice, &the pure one
