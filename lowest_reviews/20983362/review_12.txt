Getting back on the goodreads train for 2016! This was an excellent first book, however it did not meet my expectations. I was wishing for a more epic adventure tale, the events leading up to the end of the book were lacking excitement. Although I have no doubt the second book is going to be amazing with the cliffhanger Alex left us with. More or my thought here: https://youtu.be/hkt26OBYv2A
