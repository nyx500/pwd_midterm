A Lovely book and great summer read, but oh how I wish things had turned out differently...Not sure I'd want to continue the series now that Jacob is gone. I hadn't intended to become attached to Isabella and Jacob's relationship--it just happened--and now that he's gone, it feels as though much of the strength and spirit of the story are gone along with him.
