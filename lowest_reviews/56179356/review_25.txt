“Well, Harold,” I say, “they’re lesbians.”Creative but weird is the best way to describe this book.This book was interesting and I bet the pop culture references are going to be so difficult to understand in a decade— luckily I understand all of them now.It was a bit too short, and a touch too weird. I do love the fairytale history. The different iterations of Sleeping Beauty were so interesting— I hadn’t heard of half of them. Zinnia was an okay character, but not my favorite.
