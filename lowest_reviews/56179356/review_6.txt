I really like the parallel between the main character’s chronic illness and Sleeping Beauty’s curse to sleep forever. There’s clear themes in this short story: the idea that their lives are fragile and limited as they’re both “cursed” by passivity with mortality, and deciding to fight against their fate and take charge of their own stories. The writing in this novella was a bit too simplistic and juvenile for my tastes though, which made it difficult to take the messages seriously. I’ve read the author’s other work before and thought the quality of writing was better, so I wonder if she decided to just experiment with different styles in this novella. Tonally, the book actually reminds me of Shrek, where it constantly references pop culture, breaking the fourth wall, fairy tales, and subverting tropes. Much of the messaging is very on-the-nose and might be too meta in a way that’s more cheesy than clever (i.e. lines like “I hope you find your happily ever after”, “I’m just looking for a better once upon a time”, etc) It’s not my thing, but I could see a reader vibing with this if they’re looking for a light read with tongue-in-cheek writing.
