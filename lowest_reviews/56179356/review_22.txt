There is actually a Goodreads list called Myth and Folktale retellings. Over 500 books where the author has had some fun with a folk story, books like American Gods, Wicked, Grendel, The Outlaws of Sherwood, etc.Writer Alix E. Harrow has taken mainly the Sleeping Beauty story and made some changes, revisions, amendments, what haves you. And it’s fun. We can also see some other fables mixed in, and the protagonist is a folklore expert, so she knows a thing or two about old spooky tales.Here we have another story about the multiverse where a dying girl – the same folklorist and … BTW, what a cool title. I’m getting some business cards that says I’m Lyn the attorney, and also I’m a folklorist. Sounds like we’ll also need a tambourine.Anyway.Dying folklorist gets drawn into the multiverse where she finds Sleeping Beauty and things in Fantasia have gone a little off the rails. Actually we learn that Disney’s script was never all that accurate.So a good, modern retelling, not much meat on the bones, but enjoyable and it leaves me with the question – who provides her wireless coverage???? Because this chick had service in fantasyland and I get spotty phone coverage in Bedford County!
