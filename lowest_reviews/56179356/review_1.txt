ooof. this has about twenty pop culture references too many for me to personally enjoy this.i think i will stick to AHs full length novels because this was too short for me to appreciate the story. it honestly felt like it was trying too hard, cramming in so much into such a limited space. and also, i know this is fiction, and a fairytale inspired story on top of that, but not a single character acted realistically and the world-building made no sense.so between the pop culture references, rushed narrative, and weird characterisation, this just felt like a bunch of nonsense.â†  2 stars
