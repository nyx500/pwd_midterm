I received this book through Bookish.comIt breaks my heart to not give this book 5 stars. If I had to describe The Beautiful using one word that word would be....Fine.The Beautiful was just fine. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I just expected so much more out of this book. The Beautiful was probably my most anticipated book of 2019 and in the end it just left me feeling meh. The characters were bland.There were barely any cool vampires The romance was meh.The Beautiful's only saving grace was the last 30-40 pages. The way the end of this book was written is how the entire book should have been written. I already know my opinion about this book will be in the minority. I know this book will be one of the biggest books of Fall and everyone will be raving about it but I just thought it was Fine. I will probably be reading book 2 but unlike with The Beautiful, I will be going into it with lower expectations. No rec.
