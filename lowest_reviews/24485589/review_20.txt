Spontaneous buddy read with my fav, Maraaammmm“To the girlwho reads by flashlightwho sees dragons in the cloudswho feels most alive in worlds that never werewho knows magic is realwho dreamsThis is for you”Hunted is a beautiful retelling of the famous Beauty and the Beast but offers different twists to the original story. One of those twists were that we got a point of view from the Beast himself. So like, this book was GREAT but it always was MEH and that’s why I’m so  CONFLICTED  because yes it was magical and gripping but it was also DRAWN OUT. Yeva is our main character. She is a #bawse because she loves books and stories but also can hunt you down in minutes. Beast is a tortured soul and has so many layers to his personality. Yeva’s relationship with her sisters and her father are GOALS worthy like theyre all supportive and encouraging and genuinely care about each other so much. It’s beautiful. The plot was mysterious and attention grabbing, the problem is that 70% through the book and it feels like the plot is STILL building. I mean I enjoyed the world building, I enjoyed that familiar and welcome sentiment of winter that the book created, but I felt like I was ALWAYS waiting for more.And then the last few chapters were great, they were fast paced and action packed but they ended too abruptly and left me kind of disappointed.So yes, I enjoyed the retelling but I feel like it missed the mark a LITTLE too much. :p “She wept because she did not know what she wanted, and because she wanted everything.”  3.5 stars!!
