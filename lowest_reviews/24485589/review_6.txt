ive read so many ‘beauty and the beast’ retellings that ive lost count. its safe to say its my favourite story/trope to retell and i honestly never get tired of it. and this is one of the better retellings i have read. im actually surprised at how much i liked this one.i love the russian folklore influence to this. it reminded me so much of ‘the bear and the nightingale.’ its atmospheric, its mysterious, and its magical. i really enjoyed how the specific russian faery tale ties-in so effortlessly and perfectly into the overall ‘beauty and the beast’ narrative. also, i think this is the first retelling ive read where the beast character is an actual hybrid beast. its very reminiscent of disneys ‘beauty and the beast’ and, being a 90s child, my nostalgic heart loved that. overall, im super pleased with this. its true to the original story, but has its own unique vibes. which is everything i could ask for a retelling.↠ 4.5 stars
