"Gumiho," Jihoon whispered.The girl's head whipped around, her eyes bright as fire.Jihoon knew he should fear her, but instead he felt a strange fascination.When I heard about this book I knew I had to read it as soon as possible. It was one of my most anticipated releases of 2019. I love books that delve into mythology, especially when it belongs to a different culture. In Wicked Fox we get to follow the adventures of Miyoung, a Gumiho (nine tailed fox) in modern day Seoul after she saves Jihoon (a human boy) from being attacked be a Goblin. Kat Cho's writing was amazing! I loved every page, and the excitement just seemed to build up the more into the story I got.The book was like a Kdrama in book form and it just made the overall vibe so much better than it already was. There were also some 1 page chapters explaining the story of the Gumiho which I found really really interesting. I feel like it helped me connect more to the overall story. I also loved that we got to see the characters open up more. Miyoung was closed off for a while throughout the book which was understandable considering that she grew up with a strict and fierce mother. But I enjoyed seeing her connect with Jihoon and for her to finally trust someone. Jihoon was a complete sweetheart and seeing him deal with all that was uncovered just made me love him even more. The characters overall were wonderful, and enjoyed ever minute of this.I honestly love this book so much! I loved the vibes I got while reading, and I can't wait for the next book to come out and reveal more of the hidden lies and plot twists. Would definitely recommend!
