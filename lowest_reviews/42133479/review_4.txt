where in the world have i been to not know that fantasy kdrama is the genre of the year?! the korean myth of gumihos is not one i was previously familiar with, but this story is making me want to book a one way ticket to seoul to sneak a peek at the little fox fiends. for a debut, this has all the makings of a great story. its creative, it represents a culture that isnt as mainstream, it has likeable/relatable characters, and the writing is easy to read. i feel that kat cho has brought a lot to this story in terms of her culture and portrays it in a really exciting way. and oh my gosh. the food! the food sounds amazing!! every time a meal was mentioned, my mouth watered. however, i do think this was drawn out a bit too long. i feel like it could have been condensed a little without comprising the story, although the few moments of slowness werent a deal breaker for me. this a pretty solid debut and great representation of korean folklore set in a modern setting. cant wait for the sequel!â†  3.5 stars
