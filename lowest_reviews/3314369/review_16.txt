A book that I wanted to read since it first came out. I was a big fan of Altered Carbon so I was excited with Morgan's turn to fantasy. Somehow, I never read it.I have no idea what I would have thought back then but reading it now left me very unimpressed.There are some nice ideas in the story and worldbuilding and I think the action scenes are well written. Also the fact that the book was not big made it well paced. But I never felt that I read something special or fascinating.As far as I am concerned, Morgan's writing suffers from some aspects I dont like in the modern grimdark authors. I am tired of the constant witty, sarcastic bantering. It always breaks my immersion. I think it is way overused.I also feel that most of the characters are similar. Not much voice distinction. Gritty, sarcastic characters, that even though they are always ready for the worst violence and thoughts, they are all capable for much compassion and virtuous behaviour if its necessary for the story's turn.Its a cliche I find too often in the grimdark subgenre. Its like they all fill a big all-encompassing subgenre template.To conclude, I think this book might appeal to readers who enjoy anything resembling the post-Abercrombie grimdark writing, but in my opinion it lacked the prose and the little details that made the few of these recent titles that stand out for me. Namely, The Broken Empire by Lawrence, Beyond Redemption by Fletcher, Vagrant by Newman and Blackwing by McDonald
