If I rate a book five stars, its usually because I love the book so much that I reread the book at least once a year. This is one of those books, that you could pick up at a grocery store (exactly what I did) and are so shocked that you've found a favorite author. I've read all of the novels in this series and reccomend them to anyone.Michelle Sagara takes you to another world full of magic and darkness. There are two types of people that live here: immortals and mortals. Immortals are races such as Barrani(A basic description would be perfect. Tall, flawless ivory skin, long dark hair, and tend to only smile when they're killing something), or dragons (they more or less rule the world, or at least believe they control the majority of it.). Mortals are races such as Arians (Winged people. They do not like their wings touched.), leotines (In order to imagine these people, invision a lion on two feet. Their language is a series of growls and hisses), humans, and possibly a few others. Each race more or less has their own 'Cast', except humans, that is their type of government. My favorite thing about alot of the races is that they express their emotions through thier eyes; each color means something different for each race, such as red in a dragon basically means your going to die a horrible firey death. The author describes these races very well throughout the novel, and although I've tried, I can't do them justice.What really makes the books, though, is the main character Kaylin Neya; a former street urchin from the wrong side of the tracks (in reality a bridge) that tries to make something of herself working in the law system. It kinda helps that she is constantly late for work, always underdressed, takes bets she almost never wins, learns curse words in any language whenever possible, and does her upmost to 'accidently' enrage everyone around her. She truely cracks me up.
