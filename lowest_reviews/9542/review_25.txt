So I reread this, in preparation to trying to continue the series. I still didn't love it. I still didn't feel like I knew what was going on, or have any idea of the world, so I am just moving on to Book #2 hoping that it will go smoother. And that this will be like the First Kate Daniels book, which I still don't think is very good, even though I love the series as a whole.Original Review:This book took me FOREVER to read, and just as long to get into. I finally hit my stride about halfway through, where I felt like I finally had some clue about what was going on, and cared enough to find out what happened next. I admit that I would have given up if this series wasn't so popular among some of my GR friends.
