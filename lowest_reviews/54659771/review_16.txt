I fucking loved this book. Its smutty and simple and made my 🐱 clench. So what else can I ask for? I couldn’t put it down. The sex scenes were chef’s kiss and the characters??? I usually ignore personalities in most smutty books because we’re not here for that. But in this book? Absolutely nicely done. The plot was intriguing but I still have questions which I guess will be answered in the future. The modern day Hades is exactly what I needed. Can’t wait for book 2. I’m on my knees.
