This was fun, but I don't think that it quite delivered what I was looking for in a Hades/Persephone retelling. I REALLY loved the dynamic between Hades and Persephone when it was just the two of them together, but I struggled to care about the story as a whole? I never felt truly compelled to believe the stakes of the story so I never really connected to the characters beyond the surface level. With that being said, this book was still HOT AS HECK and a very fun audiobook listen, but I'm not sure if I will carry on with the series beyond this point. We shall see!
