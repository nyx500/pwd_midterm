the pitch that this is ‘a touch of darkness’ meets ‘50 shades’ is 100% accurate. as with most retellings, im always curious as to how an author is going to make the story their own, and i really appreciate KRs version of hades and persephone. i enjoyed how olympus and the underworld are portrayed as different sides of a city, with a feud between two mobs kind of storyline mixed in with high society. and dont get me started on the steam. holy cow, this book will have you fanning yourself. but its definitely more than just the physical attraction. i loved reading about hades’ growing feelings and how he copes with them. hes too precious. overall, a very solid retelling and i cant wait to continue the series!thank you so much sourcebooks casablanca for the ARC!↠ 4 stars
