This was Labyrinth by way of Angela Carter, and I think my soul has been aching for a book like WINTERSONG for the last decade. Deliciously romantic with a nuanced Goblin King figure (fancast: Tom Hiddleston) and a strong heroine, this story was rife with fairytales and music and enchantment. It's also more than a little sexy. No complaints here.
