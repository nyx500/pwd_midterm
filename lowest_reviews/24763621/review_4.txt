You know what, waving a red flag in front of a bull, getting slammed to the wall by the bull and dying would hurt less than reading the words in this book. Writers like S Jae-Jones need to be illegal because thEY ARE SO EVIL AKDHSF. Wintersong is a painfully beautifully written book about nineteen year old Elisabeth (Liesl) who has always been a responsible and caring older to sister to her siblings Joseph and Kathe, sacrificing her future and dreams for her brother Joseph. She's always lived in the shadow of her brother's music and no matter how much she wants, she can't reveal her musical talents for the sake of her family. When Liesl and Kathe decide to visit the market, something happens that causes Kathe to disappear to the Underground and she is suddenly forgotten by everyone. Liesl has to journey into the Underworld and rescue her sister,,,, but sacrifices must be made because nothing is eVER FAIR. Honestly, I can understand why some people wouldn't like the second half. While the first half is catchy and interesting, the second half reads very slow. In order to enjoy the second half of this book, you need to really like Liesl's character because it's all about her. *get ready because this is so shocking* I LOVED everything in this book. I loved the pacing, plot, characters and the gorgeous writing. The writing is so hauntingly beautiful. It's like quick sand. It pulls you in and your just unable to get out of it. Liesl is a character I really loved. Many people might find her annoying as fuck and I get it, but??? in a way she's so selfless and brave and beautiful in her plainness and I love her?? She's talented in her music and sacrifices so much for the people she loves, it makes me cry.but you know who makes me cry the most??THE GOBLIN KING.I volunteer to grow big, white, fluffy wings to protect this beautiful creature from all the evil things in the world and vow to give him warm, soft hugs and chocolate chip cookies with cotton candy and EVERYTHING PURE AND NICE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE ALL MY LOVE AND EVERYTHING NICE. He's brokenTM, The Lord of Mischief, Mein Heir, the monster i claim (fuck i'm crying ded bye), cruel, cold, but he's got a soft heart underneath all that muscle aND he let liesl go because he lOVED HER. he didn't want to hurt her by keeping her so he let her go so she will live with that fire and passsion, FUCK.Their relationship was so beautiful and y'all I cried more than I've ever cried in my life while reading this book, like goodbye and goodnight.
