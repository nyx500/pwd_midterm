++::(MINOR) SPOILERS AHEAD::++Lengthy not-exactly-a-review parody.======================================Snowchild & Blue*: Telepathic Conversations*a.k.a. the ones (in my imagination) roped in to act out the roles of Yukiko and Buruu respectively in Stormdancer. ::SESSION ONE:: Blue on Buruu, hai.Snowchild (S): Greetings, Blue-san.Blue (B): Hello again. What a book that had been.--S: You don't say, sama.B: Just stop with that sama/-hai?/hai, sama blasphemy already. --S: Apologies, Blue-san. I can't quite yet shrug the habit after being a character in that book for too long. B: Do not assault my ears, please. Is it not enough that I was portrayed as some creature that allows itself to be named by humans? You know, there was this phrase where you were intentionally downplaying our 'connection' by describing me to the enemy as 'no smarter than a dog'. --S: Oh, what of it?B: Well that was exactly how I felt I was treated, like some pet or 'friend' that humans can control! PAH. It seems K-san does not quite grasp that we, heavenly creatures, do not operate by the codes of Lassie, as they call it in the West. I can see the fantasy here, humans taming some divine beasts by virtue of some special powers. The pet culture is something foreign to one such as myself, if you pardon the pun. Befriending a special, chosen human being, maybe, but then again I stress, we come with our own names, given by our creators, or elders. Contrary to what others might think, something like Raijin's sons would not be nameless creatures waiting to be named by humans. And after their old pet at that. Seeing that K-san likes manga, let me show you some reference from Naruto on how a mythical beast thinks:Another thing. The notion that 'monkey-child' is an insult is absurd if you see it from my point of view. Because you see, our kind would naturally regard both human beings and mere beasts beneath us, the offsprings of Raijin. In the context of the story human beings are even more despicable because of their behaviour with all those lotus fumes. If I were to insult you, I would use human over monkey. Unless, of course, you are taking the point of view of a human being who regards 'monkeys' a species beneath.--S: I know; do forgive these gaijin authors. Some though might argue that it's okay to tinker around with Japanese culture in these ways because this (Japan-inspired) book is fantasy.B: LOOK. I am not an uptight guardian of Japanese culture (in any case, a griffin is not something out of Asian mythology; surprise, I am a foreigner too! If anything, it is admirable for foreigners to take up other cultures, I think). Some things you can 'tweak', as you say. Some things, you give respect where it belongs. Although, I do admit, respect can be subjective, and that is where it gets murky. Which leads us back to the hai/sama issue. Say, if sama used singularly can be interpreted as a title instead of an honorific in the story, then consider those who even have a slight inkling of its real-world usage (and this is an existing term in the real world, not something made up; so it does impact people) - whichever character uses it the way you did would come across to such readers as caricaturish, if not ridiculous. If not for us characters, nor the culture, at least give some respect for these readers; just my two kouka.--::SESSION TWO:: Snowchild (and Blue, again) on Yukiko, and descriptionsS: Speaking of respect...I think I've just about blown it as Yukiko.B: AH. SPEAK NO MORE. A fighting protagonist who cannot do a decent fighting scene without a man or me helping her? A 'strong heroine' who runs to bed with her 'crush' to 'make her forget all the pain'? But you know, for all that, I still like you. You played Yukiko in a way that she is not as annoying as most other YA heroines. Even though it was still, in essence, how I think most modern teens would behave; admittedly, the setting was 'feudal steampunk Japan(-inspired)'. This Yukiko, she was in the wrong setting and era ahead of her time and no one raised an eyebrow. So, take heart.--S: It's her, not me. And the male gaze present every time a female character comes into the picture? It makes it a little harder for me to be anything other than a beautiful, alluring vixen (Yukiko's surname is Fox, too. Like Megan Fox, but Japanese). Right, that Hiro. Let me defend myself. Again that's just Yukiko, not me. If it were me, my first instinct on seeing those eyes would've been, 'Huh, a gaijin Iron Samurai?' or 'What weird eyes, he a youkai-kin?' It's not like I've never seen green eyes before, right? The gaijin slaves were all over Kigen City.B: For the record. SEA-GREEN, LIKE JADE.--S: How could I forget? My gratitudes for reminding me. Oh THE DESCRIPTIONS! I was barely keeping my eyelids open during the early scenes from all the excessive description. I thought it might be necessary for good world building, but the style of the writing was not helping the cause, I'd say. A pity, because I really like Kigen's overall oriental-ish steampunk look and feel. It might've been better if more perspectives, or plot-linked events, were used to describe Shima rather than just turning into words what seemed like the handycam recordings of a ninja stalker. Wait, ninjas would've recorded more interesting stuff like how to spot hiding ninjas instead of how people's eyes look like polished steel or a gazillion ways in which sea-green eyes could be described visually. In short, the visual concept is worthy of praise, we just need to train the cameraman and the storyboard director well.--::SESSION THREE:: Snowchild & Blue discuss Plot and CharactersB: A tighter storyboard would do much good. Had already memorised all my lines while counting the pages before my first appearance. In my mind: GET ON WITH THE PLOT. GET TO THE STORY! (I was in fact dozing when the ship crew spotted me, which was why they managed to hit me with the tranquilizers and caught me)S: I'd say though, the plot itself, although largely predictable, was quite engaging when trimmed of the superfluous documentary. The characters, too, although a tad cliche and simplified, weren't irritating once you get past their 'Aiya' and 'Hai, sama'; their personalities had distinct, if underdeveloped, flavours (Yoritomo in particular, could've been a villain with a purpose instead of a villain with a goal). The Lotus War itself was mostly brushed over, but perhaps for YA, this would suffice.--B: I see. To be frank, I am fond of the character Masaru, even taking into account what he did to me (a scene that was written well, in my opinion). He was always there during the important events (me too, but I cannot pick myself) and the scenes, if a little too melodramatic (HUMANS, TYPICAL), always revealed a little something about the man and his personality. His parts at least did not come across as cumbersome, in that sense.S: Thank you, Blue-san. You're always acting mean, but aren't you the softie.--B: I AM AS I ALWAYS AM. YOU MERELY THOUGHT I WAS MEAN BEFORE YOU REALISED I AM NOT.S: In a way, isn't it so with this book? I'd thought it's Japanese steampunk before I realised it's not quite so. The author must've thought he'd done his best before we realised he could do better.That is why, even though I don't find the seeming lack of due respect from the author OK, there is also the chance that he is merely unaware of people's opinions, and expectations. But if he is to earn respect, from detractors or not, I am of the opinion that he'd do well to learn from his own characters. From Yoritomo:, not to live in one's own world and not consider the dissent of the masses. From Aisha: expose yourself to the realities of the world, and be able to discern the good from the bad of the world you create; and have her courage, even if it meant going against your most dear, to say 'no' to what is not alright. And from Masaru, learn that, sacrifices have to be made, so that it will all be worth it 'FOR SOMETHING GREATER'.B: AS SAID FROM MY VERY BEAK.======================================OMAKE ++EXTRAS++ You-know-what-I-mean (Images from Naruto)*Sharingan Punishments fit for Stormdancer*For the benefit of those who don't have an idea of what Sharingan is and don't want to be bombarded with images, I've hidden them.
