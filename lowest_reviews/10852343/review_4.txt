I need to take a moment to do some­thing before begin­ning this review.Stor­m­dancer is a fan­tasy nerdgasm, writ­ten by a fan­tasy nerd, for the fan­tasy nerds – and if it sounds like I just pil­fered some of the Get­tys­burg address then that’s because Abra­ham Lin­coln rid­ing a griz­zly bear was just about the only damn thing miss­ing from this book.Image by RandoSub­se­quently my life is now complete.Stor­m­dancer is a world one step removed from our own. Imag­ined as a Japan with Steam­punk tech­nol­ogy and alter­nate his­tory, chok­ing the life out of itself by grow­ing and har­vest­ing the Blood Lotus – which fuels all their mechan­i­cal mar­vels. And then there’s Yukiko. Daugh­ter of the Hunt Mas­ter, sub­ject of the ter­ri­fy­ing and cruel Shogun, impure yokai-kin sent on an impos­si­ble mis­sion to find the myth­i­cal grif­fin and cap­ture it for the Shogun.Things I liked about Stormdancer:BuruuThe Writ­ingYukikoWorld-BuildingBuruuMichiiKasumiBuruuBuruuandBuruuObvi­ously the scene stealer of this novel is Buruu. Proud, funny, vicious, blood-thirsty and beau­ti­ful. But char­ac­ters aren’t enough to breath life into a novel. What Stor­m­dan­ver has is the near-perfectly con­structed prose which trans­form this beau­ti­ful nar­ra­tive into a sprawl­ing epic. Kristoff’s style is rich, whim­si­cal and near lyri­cal in his form and struc­ture. Novice’s to fan­tasy may either get swept away or drown if it’s too deep for their skill level.Clearly a great deal of ten­der lov­ing care has gone into Kristoff’s stun­ning debut, as vis­i­ble from every sin­gle page labored with meaty lore, obses­sive detail and great imag­i­na­tion. Some may enjoy the sub­tle, or not so sub­tle, nods to other fan­tasy and sci­ence fic­tion that lit­ter this book. The plot and pac­ing keep up a steady stream of inter­est and enthu­si­asm, I felt. Mak­ing this book excep­tion­ally read­able and enjoyable.And now that I have got­ten all the oblig­a­tory seri­ous dis­cus­sion and annoy­ing stuff that I have to do to be taken seri­ously as book blog­ger out of the way, may I just men­tion one, juve­nile thing that I rather enjoyed:Orig­i­nal pic­ture by Cory Doc­torow – alter­ation based on DarkstarzAll the jizz­wor­thy toys. Yes! Great char­ac­ters, writ­ing, world-building, plot, pac­ing, blah-blah-blah… GIVE ME MY CHAINSAW KATANA, KRISTOFF!The mech­a­nized armor and sky ships and CHAINSAW FUCKING KATANAS and tat­toos and the hun­dred other lit­tle Steampunk-y ideas that filled this novel up and made it stand out above the rest! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!Ah… erm, that is all…Buy this book. Buy it and read it and love it. Then make me a chain­saw Katana. This review also appears on my blog, Cuddlebuggery Book Blog
