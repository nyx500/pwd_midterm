So for months I've seen this book alongside Rhapsodic, and idiot that I am, it took me all the way until now to be like, "Hey, maybe I should read this one!" ðŸ˜‚Well, I read it. And I freaking LOVED IT!!! The world is so unique, and while it's a "retelling" it's more like all the ancient Olympians living amongst mortals in a modern day world with lots of classical Greek influence. The whole thing was just magical and Hades is freaking HOT as SIN. I mean, the god of the underworld can entrap my @ss ANY day. ðŸ˜‚So, thank you to all you wonderful readers who led me to this book! So damn good!
