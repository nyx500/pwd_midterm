I’m incapable of writing this review without a few minor spoilers. Not a lot, just enough to (hopefully) make you not want to read this book. Also big thanks to Aliyahfor reading this with me. This book was terrible, but our collective rants made it worth it 😩 Subjective grade- 30%Plot - 15%Writing & dialogue- 60%Worldbuilding - 40%Character development - 20%Character relationships - 5%🌶🌶🌶 /5Ahh, don't we love books that step outside the norms with their characters?➻ The I don’t go to parties because they’re beneath me main character, so unique!➻ Unnecessary female rivalry. I’ve never seen this trope before!➻ The sassy best friend with more personality than the protagonist and love interest combined! Woahhh, mind-blowing! 😩Ok, no, seriously. Let’s elaborate on the plainness of these characters. The personality distribution between Lexa and Persephone was absolutely jarring. “she was a fashionista with a sleeve of tattoos. she was also a witch and a gamer” Miss girl, what? Yep, just make up for having the most boring main character in NA history by stereotyping the shit out of her best friend, that'll do!Relationships (or lack thereof) I’m sorry but the relationship between Hades and Persephone is so one-note. What, so they play one game of Rock Paper Scissors, 5 explicit sex scenes and now all of a sudden we’re supposed to ship the shit out of them? NO MAAM, NO WE DO NOT! “I’m not yours and I’m not your darling.”“We’ve been through this, haven’t we? You are mine. I think you know that just as well as I do.”Ah yes, Persephone being border-line objectified. Love that! Such a cute couple, Hades & his handbag Persephone 🥰“Tell me you have never been naked with a man,” he said. “Tell me I am the only one.”She cupped his face, searching his eyes, and answered, “You are.” I bet 10 bucks that if Persephone said “hmm well my body count is 10…” Hades would’ve left right then & there. Which is weird because Hades can do whatever he wants with anyone right?? I call sexism! Also, why is that smutty romance books, read predominantly by women, always have female main characters that gasp at the concept of sex? The math is definitely not mathing...  What was okay about this book (since saying ‘what was good’ is an overstatement).➻ Persephone and her mother’s dynamic. It was actually relatable and the only genuine thing I could find about this book. But since it isn’t a large part of this book, their relationship didn’t make up for all the nonsense going on. ➻ the smut.... Don’t look at me okay. I’m human!!Overall, A Touch of Darkness was just not it. Not worth it & definitely not continuing with the series. 11 hours of my life wasted listening to this book <\31.5 stars 😕~~~I’ve read a lot of good books in the past year and let me tell you, this was definitely not one of them. 🚫~~~{Pre reading thoughts} I’ve got no expectations for this book lol. Head completely empty.
