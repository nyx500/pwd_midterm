Review in one sentence:ahahahaha they’re so horny bruh that’s literally the entire plot 💀💀🖐Full review2.5/5⭐️I would just like to say, first and foremost, that this is not a good book. If you’re looking for a well-written, romantic, meaningful story, this is not the book for you. But.... if you want a smutty trash book? Yes. A thousand times, yes. This is pretty much the equivalent to reading a modern au fanfic. Which, let’s be honest, we’ve all been in the mood to read at one point or another. The plot: 3.5/5⭐️This is a retelling of Hades and Persephone. There’s not much to say other than that. The plot of this book is very clear. It’s a modern take on a Greek myth, filled with plenty of clubs and journalism. I wouldn’t say that it is executed in the best way possible, but Hades & Persephone is a story that we all love (and if you’re like me) will never get tired of. I will say that the pacing was a little weird at some points, but overall the plot pulled through and I found it very enjoyable. Definitely one of the stronger parts of this book.The characters: 2/5⭐️I’m sad. Do you know why I’m sad? It’s because my characters are very important to me. They are arguably one of the most important parts of a book. If they don’t have depth, if they’re not interesting, I have a very hard time loving the book. Sadly.... this book did not pass when it came to the characters. Not even close. They are all cardboard cutouts. Every single one of them. (Except maybe Aphrodite, but she was only there for like 3 pages.) Even Hades, who is supposed to be the interesting, mysterious god of the underworld, was bland. He was like every other bad boy in romance novels and shit, but somehow even less interesting than that. He is the exact same from page 1 to page 275. Do you know what that means? It means no character development. None. And he wasn’t even the worst character. He was actually probably the best. The Worst Character Award goes to.... Persephone!! This bitch, y’all. I can’t with her. She’s whiny and delicate, the epitome of a damsel in distress. She has no depth to her character, and she’s always at war with herself. “Omgggg 😍, Hades is soooo hawt🤤. But wait! 😱No, he’s not! 😔I hAtE HiM! 😤 He’s eViL! 😡” Those are her exact thoughts for the majority of the book. If I could give her one character trait, it would be Annoying. And as for the side characters... Lexa is the standard best friend in books like these. She’s no different. No better, no worse. A big pile of meh. The other side characters are also big flat stereotypes as well. Adonis, the annoying male jackass. Hermes, the teasing, snarky friend of the Hero. And last but not least, Minthe, The Other Woman, who Persephone hates for being attractive. Yeah, let’s just say that the characters are not the best part of this book. The romance: 3/5⭐️This had potential. It did. The tension was great, the banter was solid, and t he smut was just outright fabulous. (Besides how it kept saying “impaled”, cuz that was weird af.) The thing it was missing? The love. There was lust, sure, but not love. The author admitted it was only lust for about 75% of the book, and then suddenly, Persephone was all “Omg😱, I LoVe HiM!😍!” They did have some sweet moments, but not enough to claim that they love each other. The only thing they pretty much ever did was have sex. There was no confiding in each other, no honesty, no trust, no moments of beautiful, pure love. For what it was, though, the lust and the tension and the smut was done great. So 3/5 stars because it was more good than bad. The writing: 1.5/5⭐️Did I say the characters were this book’s lowest point? Well, I must’ve forgotten about the writing. Y I K E S. The writing is a mess. It really reads like fanfic. And not the well-written kind of fanfic. The kind of fanfic where you cringe after every other sentence because the writing is so unbearably bad. I have read Wattpads and fanfic better written than this. That’s not a good sign. Like I said before, yikes. So where, you ask, is the extra 0.5 stars coming from? Oh yeah, it’s coming from some quotes that were thrown in there that I appreciated. That’s it, that’s all. The ending: 3.5/5⭐️And here I was expecting the ending to go on for way too long. NOPE! It was great. Close to perfect. No, i take that back. Not close to perfect. But still great. I love it when endings reference things that have happened earlier in the book or series, and that’s what happened here. Also, it was funny, so points for that. I don’t really have much else to say, so let’s end on the high note that is the ending of A Touch Of Darkness. Happy reading!
