After having a Touch of Darkness on my TBR for a while and hearing not great things, I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it!A Touch of Darkness was a very immersive read for me with good pacing and an enigmatic love interest in the form of Hades. I think if you're a fan of Lore Olympus by Rachel Smythe, you may find the setting and atmosphere of Hades x Persephone familiar, as to me, it read a little bit like a Lore Olympus novelisation (in a good way!) albeit, a smidge darker and spicier.While I really enjoyed this, it's definitely flawed - my biggest problem being plot points that were constantly introduced and then fizzled out into nothing, making the book feel like it was twice as long and massive chunks had been hacked out of it.Definitely a good time though and will continue with the series
