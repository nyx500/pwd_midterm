5 Happy Heart STAR'S“If I was given the choice between having the world back and having you, I wouldn't be able to give you up. Not to save five billion lives.”'The Host' is a hit or miss for readers, you either LOVE it or HATE it. I think it's got a bad rep because of Twilight, and that's a bummer. As for me, I FREAKING LOVEEE ITTT!!! I'd pick The Host 100 times over the Twilight series any day! Growing up I was a very shy kid and I didn't like reading out loud in class. I was slower at reading and didn't always know the right words. So in turn, I hated reading. I despised it really. Witch it crazy because reading is such a big part of my life now. I was in my early 20's when I found my love for books and It's all because of this book right here!!! The Host was instrumental in finding that part of me. The Host will always...always have a special place in my heart. It will always be one of my all-time favorites! I have read this book 5 times if that's any indication. I was hooked from the very first page. I love the characters, the plot, the writing style, everything...I love everything about it! All the relationships are strong, the love is electric, and you feel everything they feel. This book has all the feels and it was such an emotional read for me. I cried a LOT, but I also smiled and laughed. The ending was done in such an incredible way. It left me feeling complete and I'm a sucker for HEA's♥. The host was so unique, I haven't read anything like it since.
