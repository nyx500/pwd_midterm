Listen, I can handle confusion —I mean, I did like Gideon the Ninth a lot, didn't I? I can overcome slow beginnings if the payout is worth it. I love romantic fantasy. But I can't do this. I don't have it in me to withstand pages and pages and pages and pages of character withholding crucial information because of reasons, not when it makes the whole story so damn boring. I love slow-burns, I really do love them, but it's all a bit idiotic at this point? The world-building is messy, and why Red would rather bleed herself than learning how to use her magic is truly beyond me—and I mean TRULY, wtf girl??? I just don't care enough about any other character to get going, not when I've been struggling since page one. So at this point, I really couldn't care less if the end is worth it, because it's so damn long to get there. I'm out.DNF on page 136.
