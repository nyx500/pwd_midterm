I received an ARC from Netgalley in exchange for a honest reviewWhat a disappointment.I had high expectations for this book and it didn't live up to them.The first 80/90 pages were interesting and I was loving the atmosphere, but after that the story slowly became boring and repetitive. Only towards the end something happened. I think the author focused too much on the setting and the dark atmosphere, penalizing the characters. They were flat and I didn't feel any emotions towards them. I also expected a different kind of story and maybe this is the reason why I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped.
