Finally! Whew! That book was bloody - those that read the book will understand.This book took me a long time to read - much longer than normal. I picked this book up, I put it down, I read approx. six or seven other books while reading this book. My main issues with this book were: I liked it, I didn't like it, I lost interest, I became intrigued, etc. I felt as if I were on a teeter-totter(seesaw) while reading this book. Another review used the word "conflicted" to voice her thoughts on the book and I 100% agree. The parts I liked, I really liked, but then there were other parts that left me feeling ho-hum. There were many times I thought about not finishing this book, then I would turn the page and *BAM* the book got interesting again. So, I was torn.The premise of this book sounded so promising: a girl who can speak to Gods, a prince not knowing who to trust, a boy with secrets. I thought I would love this book. In all honesty, I really think it was me and not the book. Again, I loved the fact that the main character could talk to Gods, all the characters had issues with who to trust, who not to trust, what allegiance to make, each had flaws, each made errors, each had an agenda. I also liked the thought of a centuries long war and that thought of what would happen if either side won. So, what was my problem? I didn't feel any connection to the characters, although I loved the synopsis the plot didn't always keep my attention and I was never invested in the story. This is a case of we all can't love the same book. There is a strong audience out there for this book and I encourage readers to read other reviews. This one was just not the right book for me.Thank you to St. Martin's Press and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.
