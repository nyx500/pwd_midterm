I am leaving the review below in its original form, but I want to mention that author Rin Chupeco came forward today (6 April 2021) to say that Duncan participated in bullying multiple authors of color, including calling one "ugly" for their books having similar themes. The author in question, Hafsah Faizal, has recently come forward to say it was her. This is upsetting and several other tweets seem to imply this was on some level common behavior widely known within the community, which is deeply concerning. I had actually already taken sequels to this book off my TBR over a few mostly unrelated incidents—first the book aging poorly upon further reflection, then some subtweets of reviewers I thought went just a bit over the line, then some tweets about incest shipping after the Game of Thrones finale, and then several tweets about John Boyega—and though I recognize the first two are fairly minor, I want to also point out, as Chupeco did, the racism inherent in harassing a black man over his lack of silence about racism he experienced as a member of a franchise cast. Also today, an anonymous account tweeted about issues with antisemitism within the book. Just to be so honest, I cannot remember most of this book and would prefer to share non-anonymous commentary in light of that, and if anyone can find the link to this review I would really like to link that instead of the Twitter commentary. In terms of my updated thoughts on the book, I second several points made in this review.__We are all monsters, Nadya. Some of us just hide it better than others. It’s really been a while since I’ve fallen head-over-heels for a fantasy series in this obsessive, letting-it-take-over-my-time-for-a-week way, and Wicked Saints did that for me. I had a few problems, yes, but overall, I was engrossed in this novel and in this world. → worldly worldbuilding ←Okay, so, this is Russian-inspired fantasy, with blood mages, and also clerics. The Kalyazi can contact gods, sometimes, and these people consider Tranavian blood magic to be unholy. This has caused a war. The characters in this book are on both sides of that war; indeed, our two POVs are essentially the strongest Tranavian character and the strongest Kalyazi character. Something I loved about this was the way in which divinity becomes both a question and a force within the book: characters are motivated by religion, but the story does not become one entirely about a fight for religion. I think what got to me about this world is just how expansive it feels. Wicked Saints does an excellent job juggling many moving parts in the wheel of both characters and world. It feels expansive in the way good urban fantasy feels expansive: You’re juggling a great deal of side characters without points of view but you’re intrigued to see more about almost every one.→ plot and structure and all that ←The plot doesn’t twist and turns too much in the first half, and is indeed a bit oddly structured; to use my most recent film language obsession, the first act is a bit long, meaning the narrative as a whole feels as if it’s taking a while to actually get going. It was the rest of the novel that had me completely hooked. The final conflict had me absolutely screaming. → characterization blah blah blah ←sign me the FUCK up 👌👀👌👀👌👀👌👀👌👀 good shit go౦ԁ sHit👌 thats ✔ some good👌👌shit right👌👌th 👌 ere👌👌👌 right✔there ✔✔if i do ƽaү so my selｆ 💯 i say so 💯 thats what im talking about right there right there (chorus: ʳᶦᵍʰᵗ ᵗʰᵉʳᵉ) mMMMMᎷМ💯 👌👌 👌НO0ОଠＯOOＯOОଠଠOoooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ👌 👌👌 👌 💯 👌 👀 👀 👀 👌👌Good shitThis book is told via two points of view: →Nadya Lapteva, a mage who can speak to all of the gods. Currently coming into her power.→Serefin Meleski, a blood mage prince, bi icon and honestly my favorite character. This character grew on me a lot: I loved seeing him develop.There is also a ridiculously good cast of other primary characters, including:→Malachiasz, a blood mage looking for a home in the world. The villainy love interest. →Anna, Nadya’s helper and trainer→Parijahan, an Akolan who committed murder to avenge her sister. my other favorite.→Rashid, another Akolan who allies with the group. →Ostyia, Serefin’s partner-in-crime and professional murder lesbian. my OTHER other favorite.→Kacper, Serefin’s other partner-in-crime. possible love interest to one character… maybe?→ let’s talk about that romance ←So. Honestly. One of the best parts of Wicked Saints is that this is one of the best uses of enemies to lovers I have seen in years and years. And I think I get why it wasn’t always quite as popular with others reviewers; the romance, at times, feels like the general villain love interest dynamic we have all seen so many times before, in that Malachiasz is Bad But Has Hidden Depths. Yes, I get it. I also genuinely don’t hate this trope as long as it’s not good girl x bad boy. (You can read this: as long as they both are kind of evil it’s fine.) It’s just that the overall arc of the burgeoning relationship here is just… it’s so tense, but also has so much genuine growing care, and I’m a slut for that. Their actual dynamic in the second half of the book is just… it’s tender, okay? → cliches, tropes, and derivativeness ←The major negative / positive / okay certainly a fact about this book is something that really didn’t affect my actual reading experience, but has been sort of bugging me in the weeks past, and that is the fact that this has a lot of similarities to the Grisha Trilogy. This was first pointed out by other readers, but the more it’s pointed out, the more I can’t help but notice the similarities: the Russian-inspired world, the evil love interest, and the structural similarities in the reveal of the love interest’s powers. I think at some point we should probably have a conversation about degrees of inspiration and how narratives, in their basic construct, will almost always take thematic inspiration from other sources. The question comes in where our personal lines are between thematic inspiration and essential fanfiction that cannot be divorced from its inspiration. For me, it was not a struggle to read these characters as individuals separate from their possible inspiration; in fact, I didn’t even notice until I’d already read the book. Nadya does not share a backstory with Alina or anything along those lines. I think if you were to look at the two books comparatively, you can almost read Nadya’s character arc around magic as a direct interplay with magic in the Grisha series: for her, gaining more power is not a descent into darkness in the same way. (Had I seen this as fanfiction, I would have hated it; I absolutely hate the Alina/Darkling ship.)I don’t know. I don’t know. I think this is a bigger conversation than just this book. → what i’d like from the sequel ← This was a 4-star read for me, which means I genuinely really enjoyed my experience and was absolutely addicted. But also that there are things I would like more and less of. For the sequel: more of that juicy side character development. I am ready for Parijahan and Ostyia to be on every single page. More generally, I want to get a little more of Nadya’s humanity. I liked her characterization here fine, but I definitely felt there were moments in which she lacked agency in her own story. I would like a villain love story where she can still kick the love interest’s ass, and the ending to this book certainly made me optimistic on this point. The point is, I’m optimistic, and excited as fuck to see where this story goes.
