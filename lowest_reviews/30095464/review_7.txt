BEHOLD, the fruit of my loins! Mind the thigh gap. Awesome thanks to Hypable, who did the cover reveal and has an excerpt! https://t.co/9ZUUQUWqYKWhat you can expect from THE BONE WITCH: 1. Geisha-esque girl fighters and strategists wielding powerful magic and throwing shade. 2. Male counterparts who dress in black and kick ass.3. Undead gigantic demonic beasts that do not die for long, no matter how many times you kill them4. Bone witches who can CONTROL undead gigantic demonic beasts, albeit not indefinitely5. Unexpected bonds between a sister and the now almost-indestructible dead brother she kinda sortof accidentally resurrected (who still maintains a surprising sense of humor about the whole thing)6. A couple of guys who can forge people new hearts to wear (and will be pretty important in the next book, which I am working on atm) --7. -- because almost everyone literally wears their hearts around their necks.Hope you guys enjoy reading The Bone Witch as much as I enjoyed writing it!Expected release: March 7, 2017
