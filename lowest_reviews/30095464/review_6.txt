*I received this copy from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*DNF 50%I will be brief. This book has already taken up too much of my time.•Nothing happens -and since I surely have said that before in relation to other books, let me repeat it: nothing happens. Because only now I understand that all the times that I've written these very two words before, I didn't really mean them. Never have I felt such nothingness from a plot like I did from The Bone Witch's. And what's worse, I've read a couple of reviews according to which the second half is even slower. I don't even think that's humanly possible, but I'm not as crazy as to put that to the test.•We get to see too little necromancy for me to put up with this waste land of a story.•A love triangle is to come in the second half -I know because the protagonist, who narrates the story in retrospection, says so. No thanks.•Special snowflake syndrome. I could have accepted that had I at least been spared the love triangle.•The characters are as flat as they get. No personality at all, not even a hint. Which contributed to boring me to tears.•The world-building could have been interesting maybe? Up to the first half, honestly, it's kind of dull (e.g. different colours mark out different kind of witches), and what didn't seem to be totally trite was anyway too confused to find due appreciation on my part. ➽ It saddens me that I couldn't finish it, it really does, but it was torture. I wish you all better luck, friends.
