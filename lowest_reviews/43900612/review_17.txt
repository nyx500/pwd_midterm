I want you to understand that giving this book such a low rating does not make me happy. I thought the first 1/3 was very engaging, fast paced, and I really liked all the characters introduced.but the other 2/3 simply did not do it for me. I thought the story was extremely predictable (not one plot twist shocked me) and everything was too much on the surface. the characters felt very much 2 dimensional, and some of their actions did not make sense. some characters were vilified simply to make other characters shine brighter; and the insta love was too much.it’s a nice story, it reads quickly, but I kept thinking ‘what the fuck did the editor do? nothing.’ it was painfully obvious that this book needed a lot of editing.I will be reading the other books Kalynn Bayron will write, because I definitely see the potential (2.5)
