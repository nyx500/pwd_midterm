This was such a fun take on Cinderella! From the beginning, I was hooked on this story and this society that was so obsessed with Cinderella's tale. I loved Sophia and how she was trying everything in her power to get out of following in Cinderella's footsteps and being with the one she loved. There was plenty of action in here and I loved the twists at the end of the book. The pacing wasn't perfect and some parts moved too fast while others were too slow, but overall I really enjoyed this story! This reminded me how much I love YA fantasy and how I really need to pick up more!
