"Uglies" is about Tally Youngblood, who is about to turn sixteen, much to her liking. This is a futuristic novel, and when you turn sixteen you get an operation to make you "pretty". What being pretty means is that you have all your bones taken and ground, your skin re-sized and your whole entire body is basically re-done. Like a huge surgery. The thing is, during her wait to turn sixteen (Tally was the youngest in her group of friends) she meets a girl named Shay, who doesn't want to get the operation. This doesn't make sense to Tally, because ever since she was little she has been told that she was ugly and she herself has accepted it. Shay leaves in the end to go to the Smoke, a place where runaway Uglies stay, and here's the initiating event in the book. Although Tally doesn't go with Shay, the city's Specials, who are like the police offers that keep thing in check, tell Tally that unless she brings Shay back to the city, then she won't get the operation.I read this book last year and wanted to review it earlier, but was afraid I wouldn't remember everything and not get it done right. What a good thing that I got to read it in school. This was definitely one of the better books that school has provided me with, and reading it the second time was just as great as reading it the first time. Scott Westerfeld describes everything so vividly without going overboard, and the entire theme and message of the book really connected with me, especially in the society we live in today. You must read this book!
