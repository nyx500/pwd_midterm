I think that part of the problem with this book is with the audience. I feel that readers are holding this book up to their own expectations and not reading it on its own terms which causes disappointment and, based on some of the reviews, even grief.I enjoyed Shaman's Crossing from start to finish. It is a Robin Hobb book through and through in that the characters are vividly presented and it had me pulling my hair out several times. Hobb really knows how to torture her characters and make a reader's heart ache.I will agree that Nevare is a rather passive protagonist yet I do not see this as a flaw. I think it fits his world and character precisely as the perfect soldier son's soldier son. Nevare was raised to be this way for a purpose and I feel that his passivity was not due to lazy writing on Hobb's part.I was also greatly entertained and impressed by Hobb's knowledge of military training. The life Nevare leads once he reaches the Cavalla Academy matches with my own daily experiences in military training.This book isn't an Elderling book in disguise. If this is what you are seeking I suggest you wait for the next Fitz and the Fool book due out soon. If instead you are looking for an interesting book with deep characterization or are already a professed Hobbie this book may be for you.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
