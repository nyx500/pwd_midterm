If you read this book expecting to get Fitz you will be fairly dissapointed. Because this is not Fitz at all.This story is completely different. It is a frontier novel with a totally different plot and a totally different hero. I loved Nevare as a boy and then started to even resent him a bit as he grew up but in the end he grew on me and now I find I really like him. I love the magic too and even though the book was fairly slow I have still enjoyed it.
