A slow-paced character journey where the magic feels very integrated into to world but also very vague and mysterious. It's content and tone made me think more of a historical setting than of fantasy: the military school reminded me of American civil war era historical fiction like North and South by John Jakes, Epiny with her seances and thoughts of female rights made me think of the late 20th and early 21st century, and obviously all of it is set to the backdrop of collonialism. However, it never felt like Hobb just mixed together random influeces: the world felt consistent, real and interesting. Like in every Hobb book, there is more to the world and the characters than one sees at first glance and I'm exited to see where the story will go next.
