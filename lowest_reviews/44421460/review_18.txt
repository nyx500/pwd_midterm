Like a nice cup of coffee on a rainy day, this book warmed my heart and put a smile on my face. Split into four parts, Before the Coffee Gets Cold is a wonderful, quick read that will transport readers to a mysterious cafe where its patrons are able to time-travel but must return before the coffee gets cold. There, we follow along with four different stories of characters wanting to reconcile past arguments, find closure, or assure loved ones through the use of time-travel. While this book is slow-moving and heavily reliant on dialogue rather than descriptions (something that I really, really enjoy but others may not like), I absolutely fell in love with the story and the little lessons woven into each narrative. It was bittersweet, endearing, and touching to see people from all walks of life try to reconnect with loved ones where they learn that they might not be able to completely fix the past, but they can learn from it and be touched by it. For months upon months, I've eyed this book, wanting to dive into its story, and, now, I'm so glad that I did. It felt like a warm hug given to be by a sweet yet heartbreaking read.
