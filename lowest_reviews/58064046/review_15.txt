Wow! This is a compulsively readable YA fantasy/horror novel that grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go.It's the story of Olivia, who was sent to the Merilance School for Girls when her mother died, leaving her an orphan. She's mute, and no one knows sign language, so she's stuck in her own world. She has a unique ability--she can see ghouls that no one else can see. She receives a mysterious letter summoning her to Gallant, a place with a family she never knew existed and a family who is absolutely not expecting her to show up. This book is very creepy, bit by bit things are revealed to Olivia and she unearths secret after secret. It is gothic, atmospheric, and contains a strong female lead sure to appeal to a teen audience, although adults should like the book as well. This book reminds me of a Guillermo del Toro movie--it has the right amount of mystery and the aforementioned gothic atmosphere, yet it's still quite approachable and easy to understand. I recently read another gothic-style horror novel (written for adults mind you)--Sorrowland--and while that book was very impactful it was a difficult read that took a great deal of work for me to understand. Fans of Schwab will adore this book, and if you're not already a fan and you like the genre, you should definitely check this one out.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.
