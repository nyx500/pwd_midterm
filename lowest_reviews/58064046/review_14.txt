Rated 2.5/5 stars I honestly don’t have much to say on this but I guess that’s the point. It was fine, but forgettable. I feel like I’ve read this story a million times before, and honestly Schwab’s repeated return to the idea of there being a line between worlds to cross over featuring a girl very much like the ones in her other books is proving the key point in that. Sure, the writing was nice and the concept was cool. But I can just tell it’s going to be a forgettable one for me, sadly.I think I’ll read Addie LaRue and then decide whether I just stick to Schwab’s adult books, or give up altogether.
