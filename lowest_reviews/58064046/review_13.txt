"I don’t know how to make you better.I don’t know how to make you stay.Stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me.I would write the words a thousand times if they’d be strongenough to hold you here." Well... That was something. It was good but it didn't wow me🤷‍♀️I really don't know what the point was of the plot. The story itself was not special or something I will remember. Not a lot happens in this book. As someone who is not familiar with Schwab's works, her writing does hold lot of talent and I do see what the hype is all about. But Gallant could not impress me enough. There were parts I enjoyed but there were parts which were simply put- bland. It did nothing for me. Gallant certainly has the creepy tones to it and you can actually visualise it, but it wasn't enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. The characters were flat. Something was missing throughout the read. The illustrations and the cover are so good though 😍Overall, a pretty decent read but nothing exceptional. I might try another of her books.
