Finished this at 2:00 AM on a Thursday because once I reached the halfway mark, I could not put this down. I will write a proper review when the suns up, but for now I will confidently add this to my favorites shelf. I also have the sudden, dramatic urge to buy a bottle of ink and paint, so that's exciting.
