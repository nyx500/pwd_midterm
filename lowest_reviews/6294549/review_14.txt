*** 4 ***An impromptu buddy read with the UF loving BB&B Fae maniacs!!!This was fun. I have had this series for a while, but never really thought about it. Another reason everyone should belong to a book club - you get to read things you would have never read was it not for your buddies! This is very much an Urban Fantasy and it is full of multitude of Fae creatures. Actually, rarely have I encountered the depth of Fae lore as I found here. Several times I stopped to research the mythology of different classification of Fae. I love getting this involved with a book:-)The main character, October "Toby" D. is a halfling, a mix between human father and a Fae mother. Her story is heartbreaking, but it also slowly shapes her and influences all her actions and decisions. She is not very strong, or very gifted with Magical talents, she is not a martial arts expert, nor is she distractingly beautiful, she doesn't have a family to support and guide her through tough times... It seems like fate has handed her the short end of the stick... And yet, she keeps on facing creatures bigger, stronger, and way scarier than her... We get to see how she navigates the Darwinian world of surviving in a magic filled San Francisco.The secondary characters are very well flashed out and stand on their own feet, weaving an intricate story of treacherous betrayals and political power struggles, murders, mysteries and paranormal mayhem!!! Toby gets a bit down on herself, but in her case that is quite understandable. I loved the creativity of the author which was nicely delivered by appropriately detailed prose. I also loved and was a tiny bit creepers by the blood magic, but I found it fascinating!!!As a whole, I enjoyed this book and am planning on reading all the rest in the series!!! I recommend it to all Urban Fantasy fans and wish all of you Happy Reading!!!
