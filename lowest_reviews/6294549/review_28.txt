This was a really good read. I enjoyed the magical world and the blend with urban fantasy. I'm looking forward to continuing with this series.July 2018Even better on a reread. The first time I entered Toby Daye’s world, it took quite a few books to get a full handle on both her and the world she lives in. I decided to reread the series because I’m still waiting for the most recent one to come out on kindle and it was well worth it. If you haven’t tried this series yet, I recommend you do!
