This book had some great parts, and then something that bothered me, which I will say below.This book had a GREAT setting and environment, I was engrossed in the mystery and, (although a bit exposition-y in sections) I was along for the ride the whole way and immersed in the mythology. It has no racy romance, so those who like Butcher, Green and Paul Wilson would be interested in this book/series. I definitely would pick up #2 in the series to see where it goes. Reminds me a bit of the Tim Pratt books, where I enjoyed #1 but LOVE LOVED #2 on.SPOILER:The only thing that bugged me about this book was that the main character has been trapped in a fish pond for like, 12 years from the top of the book, and the whole time I'm waiting for her to go and find her family, husband and daughter, or at least have that be a big story point later in the book, exploring what happened to those she loved while she was condemned to a life as a fish. It's set up in the prologue but doesn't happen in the book. As an aside it is mentioned that it didn't go well, her trying to contact her family, but I would have thought it would have been a DRIVING FORCE after she got loose. Maybe it's just me. I'm usually not so detailed, but if anyone else has read this chime in and call me crazy or whatever. It feels like someone WROTE stuff for this story point, but then cut it out for space or for a future installment? I dunno. After I let my need for that plot idea go I really enjoyed the book, but for some reason I got hung up on it for the first 1/3 of the book.Like I said, recommended to Butcher, Green, Paul Wilson and other fans of urban fantasy not littered with the oiled chests of hot, supernatural men :D
