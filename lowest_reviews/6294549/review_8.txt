3.5/5This was my first read by Seanan McGuire, so it took me almost half the book to get used to her writing style. I had a lot of fun once I got into the groove of the story, and I simply couldn't put it down. I was utterly engrossed in Toby’s investigation, eager to see what would happen as the story started to unfold gradually. The world the author has created is surprisingly intricate and fascinating. And in the end, when the truth was finally revealed, I was like—THAT! I knew it! Well, it wasn’t hard to guess who the killer was, but it hurt like hell for the fact that the one who tried to kill her was the one she fully trusted.My only major problem with this book was TOBY. I don’t know if I should call her a heroine. According to the story, when everyone knew who she is, they acted as if she’s a legend or a hero or someone very special, which I didn’t really get that. I went into the book expecting Toby to be a kick-ass heroine, instead, I found a very weak character. As far as I can see, she barely had any power. She had only basic fighting skills. She always let her guard down. She went everywhere unarmed and unattended. (Seriously!?) She had no killer instinct. When she was in trouble, she ran away. She asked people for help like she had the right to do it. When she was close to death (which happened many times), someone had to come to her rescue after all. She couldn’t protect herself but she thought she had to protect the others. She couldn’t even fight her own battle. She made several mistakes and made the bad decisions which cost the lives of people who cared for her. I saw nothing good in her! She’s the reason why I gave this book only 3.5 stars!Aside from my issue with Toby, I had nothing to complain. This was a very fun and enjoyable read, indeed!Do I want to continue with this series? Yes. Hopefully, she will redeem herself and has something good to show me. Please don’t let me down, Toby!
