Her eyes were fire.ðŸŒŸ This book was listed by many as a Fantasy book and not pure Historical fiction. I know that historical fictions donâ€™t work for me and I stopped reading them a long time ago. I have never seen a book in this genre getting this much hype so I thought that it must be special. Nothing was special about it and I donâ€™t think it is a fantasy book at all.ðŸŒŸ I DNFed this after 41 chapters because I didnâ€™t feel I was enjoying it and I felt like I was forced to read it. It brought me back to high school days were I had to study History although I hated it. I promised myself to enjoy books this year and to not feel forced to read anything and that was that and I did not finish it.ðŸŒŸ The book started out good and I thought it had potential and I could see why it has such a large fan base. But after like 25-30% it was being even more slow, boring and nothing was happening. The characters were not interesting and I could not relate to them. I felt when Mohamed was introduced, he became the center of attention in a very annoying way (First book to feature my name and my heart is broken). I did not feel intrigued enough to finish the book, let alone a whole trilogy. I am not so sad that I read this because I have been willing to for ages! now my TBR has fewer books so itâ€™s a win-win situation.ðŸŒŸ I am going to keep this short and summarize here: This book has a good writing style, I felt it was slow, boring and I couldnâ€™t relate to the characters, but thatâ€™s me with every historical book ever, so I may be biased and I am definitely not the best judge. If you love historical fiction then this is good, if you think this will have fantasy elements then stay away and just donâ€™t think about it.A BR with Vanessa
