"It is the way of the world. You can be the aggressor, you can fight against crusaders on their own land, or you can stay at home and wait for them to come to you. And they would come. They would come with fire, with disease, with swords and blood and death. Weakness is an irresistible lure."4.5 stars.Lada made an awesome first impression, not everyone can claim to be a badass right from birth. She wasn't exactly relatable - most of the time I couldn't figure out what her motivations were - but I couldn't help loving her no matter what. I feel like Radu and Lada switched places in terms of gender and sexuality. Lada never wanted to be female and Radu never acted like a traditional male. Perhaps this came from their lack of adult role models growing up. Mehmed made me angry sometimes... his determination to conquer Constantinople despite how many people would get killed in the process, and especially his obliviousness as the center of a love triangle. Every time he drove a wedge between Lada and Radu I wanted to strangle him, because Lada and Radu are my sibling bromance OTP - my brOTP. They should stand by one another no matter what.The ending was bittersweet. It's great that Lada is taking charge of her life without relying on any man, and I agree that she and Mehmed wouldn't have worked out even if they did get married. But the thought of Radu and Lada so many miles apart, and Radu still pining over Mehmed who will never love him back... *sobs*Actually, about that: does anyone think it's possible Mehmed is bisexual? Sometimes he seemed to get strangely physical with Radu. Maybe that's just me and my wishful thinking.Will be desperately waiting for And I Rise until 2017.
