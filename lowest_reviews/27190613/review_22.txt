EDIT: This seems incredibly random, and it is, so let's chalk it up to shower thoughts - but it's been niggling at me, especially as I contemplate picking up the second book.I sincerely hope that someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but considering this is based on history, is it not...incredibly straightwashed? In history, Mehmed and Radu were lovers for years and years, and yet in this book, the author has actually gone out of her way to avoid this, by gender bending Vlad the Impaler and pushing Lada and Mehmed together, and shoving Radu out to the perpetual "I love you like a brother" zone, even though, historically, this romance belongs to him. The author has actually strayed further from history for no reason other than to shoehorn in a straight romance where historically there was a queer one?I haven't read the sequel so I don't know what happens there. But creating what is essentially a fictional character and inserting them into a historical novel and going to all of these lengths to create a fake het romance in the place of the historically accurate and less boring queer one seems like a lot of hassle to go to when you could have just... made them in a queer relationship... like they were in real life? Am I wrong? Tell me if I am. This was just my understanding of what went down, and it made me raise an eyebrow. In terms of an actual review: I don't have one. Let's make it quick and dirty. This was one part boring, three parts thrilling, and beautifully written. It's a shame I hated Lada and Mehmed so much. Like, the thought of them now makes my eye twitch. Radu deserves better.
