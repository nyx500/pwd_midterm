This one gets a "wow". It is incredibly rare for me to read a book so immersive that I cannot put it down, and it feels like coming back to reality when I do. The first installment of the Long Price Quartet is a masterpiece that perfectly blends character, prose, plot, and concept. It is a slow burn, but for me, it never felt unintentional or muddy. The world in this story feels so uniquely its own, culture and character and language all used with precision to create a beautiful, terrible story of dark magic and ordinary lives becoming extraordinary in the right moments. I was told that the end of this quartet is where the real "wow" happens, and if that's the case, I can't imagine what is in store, because this opener was incredible.
