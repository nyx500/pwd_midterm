An incredibly intriguing first third, an incredibly dull middle and then (incredibly) you realize in the last third that the characters you're reading about are actually really interesting and fit the plot way more than you ever thought they would. An uneven reading experience but one that ended up really positive. The writing is also very impressive for a debut, even if characters "laugh mirthlessly" every other page.
