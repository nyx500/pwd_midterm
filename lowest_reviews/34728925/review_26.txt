This was a funny, clever romp through Victorian Monsters ( Jackyl and Hyde, Moureau and some of his creations, Frankenstein,.Sherlock Holmes and Watson are also characters. I enjoyed the humour. The female characters were a great mix of personalities. I especially liked Mrs Poole, the cook. Together they become the Athena Club and the ending has set us up nicely for the sequel.
