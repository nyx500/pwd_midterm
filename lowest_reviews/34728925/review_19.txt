A fun literary mash-up set in the 1890s in the vein of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen but with the daughters of some of fiction's most well-known mad scientists as well as other figures from the literature of the time.Miss Mary Jekyll has just buried her mother and without her mother's endowed income she faces ruin due to lack of funds. On discovering a reference in her mother's estate to money being paid for the upkeep of "Hyde" she seeks help from the well-known detective Mr Holmes to see if the reward for the murder Edward Hyde is still on offer. The mysteries uncovered from this lead to Mary discovering family and others women with peculiar origin stories who are all connected.This book is a lot of fun, particularly because of the interactions between the various ladies that Mary encounters and befriends. The conceit of the story is that one of Mary's friends is actually writing the story and including commentary from the group throughout, so we get the amusing reactions of the characters to how the writer is depicting them and each other. This is another "found family" story that works largely because of the clear affection that each of the ladies has for each other.This is clearly book one of a series that I will definitely be continuing with. The final chapter hints at a new addition to Mary's ladies that should prove very interesting.
