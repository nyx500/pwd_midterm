Being a fan of 19th century classics novels, this book from Theodora Goss was always going to be one I just had to get my hands on. Mary Jekyll, after the death of her mother, finds out some very puzzling information involving her father, who passed away several years before under strange circumstances, that she cannot resist wanting to solve. Her investigation leads her on a dangerous path peopled by some very intriguing people, Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson being only two of them. From the first, I wondered how Goss would orchestrate such a tale, using characters from the Gothic canon, inventing others, playing with the known stories, and I must say she does on the whole a very good job of it, putting together an entertaining mystery. It is in the characters themselves however where she shines the most, portraying their interactions brilliantly.There is one thing that might not be to every one’s taste. The author creates a very unusual narrative where the main characters keep disrupting the narration with their comments on what is being told, injecting their own views on the events and how these are being illustrated. Readers will either love it or not. Personally, I did like it very much, especially since it didn’t just enrich each personality and provide a comical angle (the nascent relationship between Mary and Diana is hilarious), but also reflected on the art of writing. It always amazes me how a technique that breaks the suspense of disbelief is used here to strengthen it... Finally, do you need to have read the texts referred to here? Not necessarily, but you will enjoy this book a lot more if you have.
