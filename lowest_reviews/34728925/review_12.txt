I have not read a book quite like this which is a delight. The writing was clever and unique considering the author is using well known/loved characters in literature. I enjoyed the mystery, but was even more delighted with the back story of each of the female characters. How they lived, what they experienced just swept me away to another world. My one complaint is there was a lot of editing errors that could have easily been avoided with misspelled words or incorrect words used in the sentence. That being said, it did not take away from enjoyment of the story itself. Think league of extraordinary gentlemen, but with female characters. Witty, clever, and a whole lot of fun.
