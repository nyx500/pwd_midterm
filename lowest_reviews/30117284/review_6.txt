Three things:1. This book tries to YA too hard2. This book tries to Sci-fi too hard3. This book tries to world build too hardI do give it 3 stars because overall I found it enjoyable, but the the things above distracted me so much. (Note: Lowered to two stars on 10/17/2017 because I thought I already gave it two and I keep thinking back to how much I didn't care for it . . . so, I had to drop it!)YA - There is a general YA formula, but if you mix it in well with a creative story, it doesn't matter if it has the same themes and general plot lines. This book wore YA on its sleeve - young love between enemies, siblings trying to save each other, every main character except the protagonists parents is between the age of 14 and 19. I could go on.Sci-fi - I am still not sure why interplanetary travel was important in this story, but it happened. Mysterious powers that just so happen to be the most advantageous to the person who has them or convenient to the storyline. It really felt like Roth just wanted this book to be in space and threw out some special high tech weirdness to make it feel like other Sci-fi YA offerings (I was frequently reminded of Red Rising - which I did not care for very much)World building - Oh man, names, locations, traditions, races - one big confusing mashup! This distracted me the most. So many weird names and odd relationships I had a hard time keeping track of what was going on. The locations and travel were not very clear (see Sci-fi above). I couldn't tell if they were on one planet, several planets, what the ultimate political structure was, etc. Maybe all this is clear for some, but I was lost a lot of the time. Despite all of this, though, I did enjoy the story and was not disappointed in the plot and cliffhangers for a sequel. I just hope Roth doesn't try so hard to do what is expected.
