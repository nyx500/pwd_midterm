this book reminds me of preteen me, meaning it tries too hard to fit in with all the cool kids. oof. not a good look for anyone involved. trust me.this book tries a little too hard to be YA relatable, to be sci-fi intense, and to have the most fantastic world ever built. and i think because there is so much focus on all of these different elements, it neglects one major component - THE PLOT. my goodness. its practically nonexistent. combine that with some slow pacing and you get many bored readers. i wasnt so bored that i couldnt be bothered to finish it, because there were some parts that actually interested me, but i did feel my eyes glaze over from time to time.but the concept still remained interesting to me throughout, even if i had to trudge through it. and i thought the characters were relatable and engaging enough. i do think they took a backseat to all of the world building, which is a shame. but i was invested enough to care about seeing how everything worked out in the end. overall, this has its ups and downs. its a pretty average read, and not one i would particularly recommend to anyone, but i dont regret reading it.â†  3 stars
