4.5 StarsOh, so much of this book is exactly what I wanted.There was first an old and dusty bookstore.With an old and whimsical caretaker.And a prophecy surrounding a secret cult of black robe wearing bibliophiles, written in code form.Did I mention that this secret cult meets in an underground library? The entrance is a fricken' swiveling bookcase! Hell, even the characters have interesting names such as Kat Potente, Corvina, and Ajax Penumbra.There's even a bit about google and coding which reminded me of one of my recent new favorite books, The Circle, and made this book seem both classic and contemporary at the same time.The writing is really witty and I was caught off guard quite a few times by the unexpectedly funny twists in storytelling.BUT... oh, how I was disappointed towards the end. The interesting parts of the story just fall apart and there are a few trips to dullsville. The whole reveal of the code was a major letdown, which I thought did not suit the rest of the book at all. I was loving this book up until that last 3rd, and it feels like the writer just handed the rest of the story off to someone who didn't know how to make it connect to the beginning. For that lame ending, I'm giving this 4.5 stars - and trust me, it is killing me to do that to one of my favorite books of the year so far.
