Initial thoughts:1. Loved Clay. He is wonderfully funny, and geeky. His journey throughout the story was fantastic.2. Loved the combination of new and traditional, young and old. Seeing ideas, and characters that are different and opposite come together.3. Lot's of wonderfully geeky elements. Design, typography, technology, books, and other very nerdy things. It was AMAZING.4. I really liked and appreciated how the characters and the story was grounded in reality. There are a lot of elements that had the potential to shoot off in the fantasy/sci-fi realm, but I was glad that it didn't. Really grounded the story and made it more realistic.5. Why doesn't my cover glow in the dark?! -__-;
