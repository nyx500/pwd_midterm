Thoroughly enjoyable, with a wild-goose chase of a librarian through Hell, Heaven, Walhalla and even earth and the Minoan afterlife. Bit sweet in resolution but got me hooked and interested all the time along the wayAnything can happen in service of a storyThe premise of The Library of the Unwritten sounds amazing: a grumpy librarian, presiding over the Library of Unwritten Books, located in hell, is led to deal with a major crisis. And A.J. Hackwith delivered on her concept, with brisk head librarian Claire, a Hero who struggles against his fate, a demon who is not what he seems to be, a fallen muse and two angels who are quite pissed. An accountant having a snippet of the illusive Devil’s Bible, turning up at the gates of heaven to barter this dangerous piece for access to paradise, is a nice added touch to set the whole story into motion. Sometimes the level of coincidence and convenient limits to magic (since we are dealing with supernatural beings in various afterlives) is a bit too obviously visible, Claire's attachment to Leto had me rather puzzled for a long time, but the characters are vibrant and snappy, and I was kept engaged throughout the book. Warmly recommended for a quick and fun read!Quotes:Only books died in hell, everyone else needs to live with their choiceWe all get the afterlife our soul requires.Unpleasant?
