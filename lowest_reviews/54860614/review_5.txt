“I would not let a man who knew the value of nothing make me doubt the value of myself.” 4 stars ⭐️ I’m a sucker for retellings. Particularly ones based around Greek myth. Ariadne lives on the island of Crete with her controlling father Minos and her bull brother The Minotaur. When the Greek hero Theseus arrives with a collection of Athenians to be sacrificed to the Minotaur Ariadne becomes infatuated. She sees an opportunity to stop the slaughter of innocents and take control of her own fate. But everything changes when she leaves with Theseus and he betrays her by abandoning her on an island to die. But Ariadne’s story does not end here. I loved the twist on the Greek heroes. Theseus is an asshole and I loved hating on him. I enjoyed all the different elements and characters, including Daedalus and Icarus. It was good to see the other sides of Dionysus as well. I liked both Phaedra’s and Ariadne’s point of views. Overall, really enjoyed this and can’t wait to read more from this author. **********************My wait is almost over! I asked at the library how far down the queue I am for this book. I am next in line! Honestly I’ve been waiting so long I really I hope it lives up to the hype I’ve made up in my head 😂😂*****************I heard Greek mythology retelling and here I am.
