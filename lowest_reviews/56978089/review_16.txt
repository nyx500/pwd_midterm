It's always a bummer when a book you highly anticipated doesn't land well and that was the case here. I felt like we really didn't get to know any of the characters well outside of our main character and there was a major lack of depth with everyone we encountered. The plot is filled with convenience for our main character and things tend to just work out well for her without much struggle. I did enjoy the writing style and the bits of magic that we got to see, I loved. Outside of that I just didn't mesh well with it.
