This was EVERYTHING I wanted in a fantasy book!! 😍😍 Such a cool magic system, stunning writing and a really entertaining plot. I thoroughly enjoyed my time reading this! ☕💖“Grief has a taste, bitter and lingering, but so soft it sometimes disguises itself as sweetness.”A Magic Steeped in Poison follows our mc Ning, who is suffering from the grief and guilt from losing her mother after she unknowingly brewed a batch of poison tea- the tea that is now killing her sister, Shu, too. Then Ning hears of a competition to find the kingdom's best shennong-shi (masters of the ancient, magical art of tea-making), where the winner will receive a favor, she travels to the palace to compete, desperate to save Shu. But Ning is soon caught up within the bloody court politics and with a handsome boy with a terrible secret distracting her, her life may actually be the one in danger...“There is a difference between living the suffering and reading about it.”I've had my eye on this book for AGES (ngl, mostly bc of the gorgeous cover 😍), and have just put it off but ages- but I'm so glad I finally picked it up!! 💖 This was such a magical fantasy book that I just had such a good time reading it 🥰🥰Starting with the characters- I really liked them! ✨ Our mc, Ning, was super easy to connect to and I really admired her willingness to do anything for her sister. Her development throughout the story was really well-done and I was rooting for her throughout the competition 💗💗 I also really liked our mmc, Kang- he was such an interesting character and finding out more about him throughout the story was so interesting. He's honestly so sweet, i love him! 🥰🥰“How can I give another part of myself to someone else, when I already have so little to give?”Next, the writing- which was absolutely stunning!! 😍😍💖💖 Judy I. Lin's writing is so gorgeous and descriptive and just has this magical quality that I adored 💗 It kinda reminded me a little bit of Stephanie Garber's writing- they're not exactly the same, but both create such a magical feeling which really drew me into the story! 🥰 I also loved the way Asian culture was woven into the story- Asian fantasy always has the most amazing cultural influences. There were tons of descriptions of the food and tea they were making, as well as the type of society they were living in, which really entranced me and made the story feel sm more interesting! 💗💗I also really enjoyed the plot!! 🤩🤩 I think the author paced it really well- there was always something to keep me interested, whether that be action, the competition scenes or little sprinklings of romance 😏 The competition was super interesting to read about and kept me hooked. I also really liked the action at the end, which definitely left me wanting to pick up the sequel!! 💖There was also a little romance subplot- which was super cute!! 😍😍 It's definitely not the best romance I've ever read, but I thought it was adorable and they did have some really good scenes. The chemistry was definitely there. There was a bit of drama between the couple in the end, so hoping we get more of them in the second book! 💗“I'll rescue you ten times over if I will be kissed like that every time”Overall, this was sooo good!! 😍😍 Would absolutely recommend if you want:✔ Asian fantasy✔ Beautiful writing✔ Likable characters✔ Cute little romance subplot!I definitely want to pick up the sequel at some point!! 🥰🥰~ 4.25 stars~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This was so so good!! 😍😍 Such a magical fantasy read that I thoroughly enjoyed ☕💖RTC!
