“The more you give the magic, the more it takes.” This book was so good! This was an enchanting and stunning fantasy full of Chinese mythology, magic, and political intrigue. Ning is a shénnóng-shi, a master of the art of tea-making. Her mother was her mentor and she recently died from a poisoned tea that Ning brewed. Ning enters a competition to decide who is the best shénnóng-shi in the kingdom and if she wins she will be able to save her sister who has also been poisoned. Eventually, Ning discovers that she may be in more danger than her sister because of competitors who try to harm her and soon she becomes tangled in deadly game of political intrigue. The pacing in the beginning was slow but by the middle I was swept away by the beautiful world that the author created. The writing was beautiful and very descriptive, although it was a bit flowery at times. The world-building was amazing, I was blown away by the interesting characters and the unique magic. The book is told from Ning's perspective. I loved Ning, she is strong, brave, caring, and will do whatever it takes to save her sister. I really liked Ning's friend Lian, she is sweet, helpful, and brave. I liked Kang, he is handsome, mysterious, helpful and kind to Ning. I really liked the romance between Kang and Ning, but I was hoping for a few more romantic scenes between them. The side characters were all interesting and they each had their own unique personality. There were several surprises that I didn't expect. The ending was so good! I can't wait to read the next book!
