There's not a lot to say about this one, other than that it's worth a read. Ahmed undertakes something both bold and unique -- an Islamic fantasy novel, set in another world which closely parallels our own in the medieval period (not unlike something Guy Gavriel Kay might write), but in which an Islamic God and angels and holy scripture (still) exist. It is exactly that feature which makes it so Islamic, and yet so unusual -- it posits that there is another world (or maybe an alternate version of our own?) but assumes that God is God there too, and a traitorous angel is a problem there to, and that (of course) a prophet would need to have been called to preach God's word there too. This is the sort of thing you'd expect from a Latter-Day Saint (aka: "Mormon") writer, but a Muslim? It is at once radically innovative and perfectly, obviously logical! So it's interesting, it's innovative, it's uniquely Muslim... But it's also fairly weak at points. Ahmed focuses heavily on dialogue, which is very well done, but the descriptions are sorely lacking and you never get a terribly good picture of the world or the scenes or...anything. He glosses over it in some ways, and that is to his detriment. The ending is also somewhat weak, petering out abruptly and unnecessarily. So, 3 stars. A great concept executed unevenly, and I hope Ahmed writes more, better novels in the future.
