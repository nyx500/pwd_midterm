oh, thank the literary gods that the beauty of this story matches the gorgeousness of its cover. there is no greater relief, im telling ya. this story is everything everyone is saying it is. its culturally rich, stunningly written, masterfully plotted, and cleverly wrapped up. i really enjoyed reading this! with all the twists and turns along the way, it is quite the adventure. its a very high-quality debut and one i hope the author is extremely proud of. so if this is so great, how come i didnt rate it higher? its because i wanted more magic! this story is overwhelmingly heavy in court politics and war, so much so that my interest began to fade after a while. i understand their importance in creating a complex storyline, but their presence in a story shouldnt mean that the fantasy components of a fantasy novel take a back seat. if anything, it should be the other way around - magic as the main focus with the politics and war plots as support. in this book, there is an entire population of people who have magical abilities and its never really explored. such a shame. i know this is a stand-alone and that most of the questions are answered but, with that epilogue, i really hope a sequel is a possibility down the line!â†  4 stars
