*3 CONFUSED STARS*“What is truth? Scholars seek it. Poets write it. Good Kings pay gold to hear it. But in trying times, truth is the first thing we betray.”Damn! I really wanted to love this, I truly did.The comparison to a Chinese-inspired Game of Thrones had me so hyped!And it all started off really well! There were so many plot twists, both predictable and unpredictable ones. The writing was phenomenal, can’t say anything bad about that. The world-building couldn’t have been better and was very intriguing.Yet somehow I couldn’t seem to get into this and I had a really meh feeling after finishing this. Is it just me? Am I in a reading slump? Was it a bad idea reading this while I was on holiday? Am I just too stupid for this book? Will there ever be a sequel to answer all my unanswered questions? Who knows.
