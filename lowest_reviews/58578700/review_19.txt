I’m trying to write this review but I don’t even know what to say. This book was just...wow. It was so good. I LOVE political intrigue and this book was full of it. And we also got a magic system that I found so interesting. And the TWISTS. Omg the twists. This book is so good. Go read it. Oh an did I mention the sibling relationships? I love them. Siblings in books always take me out and this one was especially good.There’s also like a little hint of romance but it’s not huge. Like if you just want romance this isn’t it. But when you want a fantasy story with a hint of romance, this is absolutely perfect.It killed me. This books great. I don’t know what else to say other than read it. TW’s : Death, Genocide, Murder, Poisoning, Physical violence, Torture, GriefRight after reading:What the actual fuck. Idk who recommended this book to me but we need to have a talk. Omg. If you’ve read this please talk to me about it omg I can’t do this.
