"Of course, heroes cannot be forged without villains..."I REALLY enjoyed this. It is absolutely FULL of twists and turns, with stunning writing and super intriguing characters and a centuries-long fight against prejudice and discrimination. The one thing that peeves me off about this is that it's marketed as a standalone when it is SO OBVIOUSLY NOT a standalone. The author has stated that she has companion novels lined up but the publisher is probably waiting to see how successful this first book is. ANNOYING. Also, there was a moment in this where I was like OMG IS THIS GONNA BE GAY??? But it wasn't *sigh* Anyways, thoroughly enjoyed this one and would highly recommend!
