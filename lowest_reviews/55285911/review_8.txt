Not perfect but not bad either. ✔️ Hades x Persephone retelling✔️ Beauty and the beast retelling✔️ Slow burn ✔️ Arranged marriage  Things I liked-  1. It's  fast paced  and something that has the potential to get the reader out of a slump. 2. It's  lighthearted with nothing too chaotic or dramatic. Doesn't have anything complex. It's a pretty easy read. 3.  Harrow, the MMC's brother  was trouble and a charming one at that too. I liked him more than the main characters. He came across as genuine and one with full of personality, which made me wish at times that he was the love interest 👀🤭 Things that could have been better-   1.  The main characters- Eldas (MMC) and Luella (FMC)  were okay, they did not have much depth to them, which is why they are quite forgettable. Eldas although has his sweet and sexy moments, he also comes across as rigid, and overpowered Luella. Luella, although is a selfless character but has nothing else to her personality. She is a healer and a queen but somehow she doesn't have anything to offer. 2. The  world building and the magic system was weak.  I would have preferred if it was more built on and explored. Half of the time I did not understand the hows and whys. So the conflict at the end got impacted cause of it.3. The  romance  was slow burn. But there was no angst to it, by the time the two kissed it felt like a meh scene. Had there been more angst, I would've considered bumping it to 4 stars. The chemistry was okay-ish. 4. The way Luella and Eldas communicated with each other was too formal and it irked me.  They talked to each other as king and queen, not husband and wife, not someone in love. Although Luella tries to get Eldas open up a bit but she herself is the same 😅Overall, it's a decent read but nothing special. It's quite a forgettable story but an easy read. I haven't read any other books prior to this by this author so hopefully the rest of the series will improve.
