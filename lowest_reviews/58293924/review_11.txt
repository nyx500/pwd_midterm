i came back to change my rating, this book doesn’t even deserve 3 stars. this was so fucking boring. i was loving it at first because it’s holly black and it had mentioned tarot cards and i do tarot. i kinda hated the way tarot card readers are represented (?) in this book. as if they’re scammers, i know it’s fictional but it just didn’t sit right with me. the book was boring as hell, the main character was bland and honestly there wasn’t a romance. i don’t need a romance to enjoy a book but i just feel like if there was a romance there would’ve been something redeeming about this book but it just.. was not.
