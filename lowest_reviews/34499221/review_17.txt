RATING: 5/5I LOVED THIS BOOK!! Is it weird that I am obssessed with the two main characters? They're fkn murderers! I don't think that's ever happened before. It's not my style to include synopsis in my reviews, but I'll make an exception just this once because I really want others to read it. We got two POVs in this story: The first is from a siren princess that kills human princes. The second one is from a human prince that kills sirens. Their paths cross and...you'll have to find out the rest for yourself ??This was one of my most anticipated reads of the year and I'm sooo glad it didn't disappoint. Once I started I could not stop. It felt so real, which is ironic because it's a fantasy. Something about Lira and Elian was addicting and I couldn't get enough. I do have a couple of complains, though. The big reveal (when one of the characters found out about the other's identity) was too simple. I don't know what I was expecting, honestly. Maybe a little more yelling? Or just a heated argument? Whatever, I can overlook that part. However, Elian's decision at the end is kind of hard to process. Maybe I'm just used to fantasy characters being overly complicated and I can't settle for simplicity. Best thing about this book? The EPIC plot. I don't have much experience reading retellings but I definitely felt a Little Mermaid vibe from this. Mission accomplished, autor!In conclussion, this is definitely a favorite of the month and possibly of the year. Was it worth the wait? YES. Would I recommend it? YESSSS!
