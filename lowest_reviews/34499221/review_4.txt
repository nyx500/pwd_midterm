Where would I be, as a person and in society, without the enemies-to-lovers trope where two people, who are actual literal enemies fighting on opposite sides of a conflict and who can hold their own against each other and even in their hatred have a begrudging respect for the other, come together on equal ground and slowly realize that they have more in common than they’d first thought, they don’t instantly get along but bicker and deny and fight their way into a tentative friendship that is born of a deep understanding and trust and respect found in companionship which later slowly blossoms into a whirlwind of a romance, and the best part? THESE IDIOTS WILL STILL BE ACTING LIKE JACKASSES TO EACH OTHER BUT AFFECTIONATELY AND WITH SO MUCH LOVE!!!Can I just scream about this trope for the rest of my life and let that be my career?
