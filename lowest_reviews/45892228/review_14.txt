At first I thought this was going to be a two star read because I hated how similar this was to Twilight. It felt like this book was Twilight rebranded. But once you get halfway through it loses those similarities and becomes its own story. The writing was great, I was invested from beginning to end even during the parts that annoyed me. The pacing was fantastic and it didn’t feel slow at any parts. And the fantasy element intertwined in a modern world was well done. The storyline I found really intriguing and what happens at the end with the main character I didn’t fully see coming. That also made me kind of wish it was something I could have guessed. But, it also left me even more excited to see what will happen in the sequel. And I think this book would have been even more interesting if there were more chapters in the POV of Jaxon. The main character, Grace, started off being so similar to Bella in that everyone is constantly fighting for her and protecting her and in the end she is the one that is protecting everybody. The romance in this book I felt iffy about, I don’t hate instalove, but if a book is going to have it then it should also show the pair growing together. We don’t see that much in this book other than their sexual chemistry. But, I would say this relationship is better than Bella and Edward’s. I don’t like comparing books but this book was so similar to Twilight, that there was no way around it. Overall, I didn’t expect to enjoy this book as much as I did and I can’t wait for the sequel.
