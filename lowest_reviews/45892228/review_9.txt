Crave is like Twilight grew up to be a witty, sophisticated feminist with a flare for fun and sexual tension. When reading, “Crave” the easiest comparison to draw would be that of, “Twilight”. But I feel like I would not be giving the author the credit due for what she has done for this genre. No, “Crave” may be the vampire love story we were missing from Stephanie Meyer’s series but we have arrived in 2020 more sophisticated, demanding more from our heroines, and our literature. I sat with Grace and Jaxon in every room and on every piece of furniture in my home and devoured, “Crave” from breakfast to bedtime. You will fall in love with the elegant world of Katmere Academy. You will gasp and plea for each page of romance, conflict, and plot twists. You will giggle, smile, and swoon at the texts exchanged and the witty dialogue between every lovable character. You will devote yourself to a faction and declare your loyalty to dragon, witch, vampire, or werewolf. Your heart will skip, soar, and sink for Jaxon along with his gaze and charm. You will identify with the strength, smarts, and cautious vulnerability of Grace, our heroine. And you will be left, like me, completely mind blown by an amazing ending, ready to journey Alaska, and what comes next in the world Tracy Wolff has created.
