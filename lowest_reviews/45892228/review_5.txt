Missed Twilight...?! 😱Grace's life change after her parents died in a car accident, and so, from the life she knows in hot California - she moves to the frozen Alaska, but discovers she has to deal with much greater troubles than the cold... ❄❤📚 "𝑻𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒏𝒐 𝒔𝒖𝒄𝒉 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂𝒔 𝒎𝒐𝒏𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒔, 𝒋𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒑𝒆𝒐𝒑𝒍𝒆 𝒘𝒉𝒐 𝒅𝒐 𝒎𝒐𝒏𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒐𝒖𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒔." 📚She moves in with her uncle Finn and his daughter Macy. Finn runs a private prestigious academy, but from the moment she enters "Katmere", Grace doesn't feel like she belongs there. Everyone hides something, and she has no idea what... 💥In her first day, Grace meets the most popular boys at school, and the great enemies: Flint - the nice boy who received her with a big smile... and Jackson - the broken, tormented and mysterious boy who, despite his 'not so very nice' welcome, she can't stop thinking about him and his secrets... ❤❄📚 “𝑻𝒘𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕? 𝑯𝒆 𝒔𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒎𝒆 𝒂 𝒄𝒐𝒑𝒚 𝒐𝒇 𝑻𝒘𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕?” 📚And so, Grace reveals a new world. A world of vampires, dragons, wolf shifters and witches... and she, the mortal, is still trying to decide where she belongs... 💥💥💥But is Grace's arrival at the Academy was destiny? Or did someone deliberately bring her there to stir up an old monster and start a new war...? 😱 The book was a combination of *Twilight* (the vampires, werewolves - and the mortal linking them) and *Harry Potter* (the prestigious school and the girl who finds out about a new world, she is part of) - BUT it was the modern upgraded version. 💪📚 “𝑾𝒆𝒍𝒍, 𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒅 𝒐𝒇 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒄𝒉 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒄𝒂𝒏’𝒕 𝒅𝒐 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂𝒏 𝒆𝒍𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏-𝒚𝒆𝒂𝒓-𝒐𝒍𝒅 𝒌𝒊𝒅 𝒄𝒂𝒏 𝒅𝒐?”“𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒅𝒐𝒆𝒔𝒏’𝒕 𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒆 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝑱. 𝑲. 𝑹𝒐𝒘𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈’𝒔 𝒃𝒓𝒊𝒍𝒍𝒊𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒈𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏.” 📚I liked that although there were lots of characters - which can be confusing, Tracy presented them at the right time, I loved the expectation for Grace to discover the truth. However, since this is *a teen book*, rather than an "action" between the characters, most of the plot was full of descriptions and explanations - which was interesting, until about 70%, where I started to get tired. Well, probably because this book is very VERT long (592 pages). 😬❤ 📚 𝑴𝒆: 𝑼𝒈𝒉. 𝒀𝒐𝒖 𝒔𝒖𝒄𝒌 𝑱𝒂𝒙𝒐𝒏: 𝒀𝒐𝒖 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒏𝒐 𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒂 𝒉𝒐𝒘 𝒎𝒖𝒄𝒉 📚 However, I couldn't ignore the "Twilight" style plot, of the teenage girl who refuses to give up on the bad boy she met just 10 minutes ago (even though when she's with him, her life is in danger every 5 minutes 😬) and the bad boy that I had no idea why he was attracted to her in the first place, who warns her that he is "dangerous," but can't get away - So there is no doubt that comparison to"Twilight" is inevitable... BUT if you ask me, this book was much more sophisticated, with the addition of humor and sexual tension (PG-13 obviously - which totally made me frustrated, because... come on, TAKE OF YOUR SHIRT, GODDAMMIT!!!). 😂😂😂📚 “𝑶𝒉, 𝑬𝒅𝒘𝒂𝒓𝒅, 𝑰 𝒍𝒐𝒗𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒔𝒐 𝒎𝒖𝒄𝒉! 𝑾𝒉𝒐𝒐𝒑𝒔, 𝑰 𝒎𝒆𝒂𝒏 𝑱𝒂𝒙𝒐𝒏.” 📚 I didn't read many YA books to compare, but I totally enjoyed this book and the ending left me curious for more (this is a first book from a series, end with a cliffhanger). It was full of action, paranormal, love and lots of humor! ❄❤▪️▫️▪️▫️▪️▫️▪️▫️▪️▫️▪️▫️▪️▫️▪️▫️📖 ᖴOᒪᒪOᗯ ᗰE Oᑎ IᑎᔕTᗩGᖇᗩᗰ: 🎉 https://www.instagram.com/the_romanti...📖 ᐯIᔕIT ᗰY ᗷᒪOG ᖴOᖇ ᗰOᖇE ᖇEᐯIEᗯᔕ: https://books-romance.com/
