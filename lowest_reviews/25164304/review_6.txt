*4.5/5 starsI will have many more thoughts on this book when I do my video review, but for now I just want to say that my heart feels like it is glowing. I put the book down 10 minutes ago and I haven't been able to stop feeling so happy about the way this story developed and the way that Mare and Denna's relationship evolved.If you are a huge fan of the dislike-to-love relationship trope, I would highly recommend this book. If you love horses, you would love this book. If you love QUEER FANTASY (and #ownvoices at that) you will LOVE THIS BOOK. I can't get over how much I adored so many aspects of it. A bit slow to start, but the second half knocked me off my feet and I seriously can't wait to read more by Audrey Coulthurst. *I received an ARC of this book through a giveaway, all thoughts are my own*
