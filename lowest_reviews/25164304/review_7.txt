Really enjoyed this book. I LOVED the romance between the two princesses! I literally DIED for the descriptions! Also i loved the magic in this fantasy novel, so unique and easy to understand. WONDERFULWAY to much 'horse' talk for me personally, but thats my only issue with the story! OH PLEASE I NEED A BOOK TWO
