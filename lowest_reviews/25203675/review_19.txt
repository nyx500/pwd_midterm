ART. ART. ART. ART. MAGICAL ART.This book is LITERALLY MAGICAL, GLITTERY, WONDERLAND ART.Like I can't even describe how beautiful this book is. I could have taken out all the dialogue and just read the descriptions of the lands and places they were visiting, the things they saw and the impossible becoming possible and I still would have been glued to the book. Like is there fan art of this book? I want to see this thing COME TO LIFE.Like seriously when she goes down into The Otherworld I'm just like on that trip with her. Like she was basically Alice falling down the rabbit hole into Wonderland but instead make it something of mythology and even more magical and crazy and beautiful and holy cow, can I read that for the first time again?Ugh, I can't talk good well right now. Here's the scoop: seventeen year old Princess Maya is feared by everyone that she ever comes in contact with. Why? Because her horoscope spins a tale of her marrying death and bring destruction. To save her kingdom, she has to pick a husband.. little did she know that was the beginning of her journey of discovering the beauty in her horoscope, but the horror of it too.I have heard it said that this is a retelling of Hades and Persephone, which I could totally get on board with. Just sprinkle in a little Wonderland and pure, unyielding magic and this book is what you'll get.Seriously Roshani Chokshi writes so beautifully. She really brought this book to life.
