it is with a heavy heart I must announce that I just don’t care about anything that happened in this book. All you know are stories, Enne told herself. And not all stories are true.I should start this off by acknowledging that this book is built on a lot of good ideas. Ace of Shades takes place in what is described as a city of sin, a sort of Old Vegas meets Venice. There’s enemies to lovers, a very diverse cast (the book’s romantic interest is black & bisexual), an intriguing magic system, and the broad outline of the two lead characters is quite good. The issue is that nothing about this book ever really feels like it gels. This book, feels, to me, like a lot of good ideas cobbled into something that just never really goes beyond its elements. Perhaps the main problem here is I never felt any investment in 1) the characters or 2) the overarching plot. In terms of the characters, I had a very simple issue: Levi and Enne genuinely bored me. Levi is fairly likable and has the broad outline of a character arc revolving around personal agency. Enne is honestly… incompetent, and has a character arc revolving around finding her role in the world. I tend to struggle with less competent characters.In terms of the plot, I was equally disappointed — the arc of the book has very little thematic weight. And I just genuinely thought that while the outline had a lot of potential, there is a whole lot of nothing happening here. The plot twists get wilder and wilder and the actual details of the story simply build and build, but I never found a reason to care, so I stopped remembering the details. I think this author will probably write something I enjoy far more in a few years. But for now? I’m not into this. Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube
