to compare this to ‘six of crows’ has been a disservice to not only the reader, but to both books, as well. it sets an impossibly high standard, one that will only lead to disappointment. having seen a lot of negative reviews in regards to how this book was pitched and the comparisons made, i decided to go into this with a completely open mind and no expectations whatsoever - which i think is the only thing you can do in this particular situation. and it completely paid off because i quite liked this!the story itself was interesting. not exactly unique, but just the right amount of captivation to keep me engaged in the plot. if i could change anything, it would be the world building as it was a little weak - the reader is kind of just dropped into this city and expected to go along with everything. which wasnt too bad considering there was a lot happening with the plot and the quick pacing, but like, for example. the game of shadows is mentioned numerous times throughout the book, but i honestly had no idea what it really was until it actually happened. and even then, it only lasted one chapter! the story definitely focuses on the characters more than the world around them.but overall, this was still really good and im pretty sure i will continue the series when the next book comes out. i would suggest anyone eyeing this to go ahead and give it a try, but to get rid of the expectations that it will be the same as another book you have previously read and loved. ↠ 4 stars
