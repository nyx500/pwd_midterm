“Forgetting was not the same as healing.”really impactful story about collective memory and trauma and trying to unravel the responsibility of the individual to the collective. I really like speculative fiction and this has such a good premise (the children of pregnant women thrown overboard during the transatlantic slave trade became mermaids) I loved the authors note about how this book came around and the collaboration across multiple creative platforms, really interesting. Yetu was a sympathetic and her role as the historian led to some really interesting discussions around psychology and the burden/trauma of remembering versus the liberation and relief of knowing and feeling connected to your identity and heritage. I really liked her discussions with Ori centring on this theme. This felt thematically rich and explores so many issues around culture, history, life and identity in such a short period. It's also wonderfully queer. There were a few parts where the POV shifts confused me (could be due to the audiobook rather than the writing) but overall I really liked this
