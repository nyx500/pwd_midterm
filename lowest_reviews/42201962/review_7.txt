I have mixed feeling about The Deep by Rivers Solomon.First, I LOVED the premise of a merpeople originating from pregnant african slaves being thrown overboard - it's what really drew me into reading to book.The story however - not much happens and the pacing is very slow. Now this is not necessarily a problem to me, but coupled with a very vague worldbuilding and a very blank slated main character, whose perspective the story is told from, I ended up spending 6 days reading this 176 page novel.I liked the historical part of the story, reading about the merpeople's origin, how they found a language and how their culture and society came to be. And I was very pleasently surprised to discover that this is a very LGBT friendly book (lesbian human/mermaid ship hell yeah). The writing was also really great.If you want a different take on mermaids, then you should definitely give The Deep a chance.
