3.5 stars -- I'm so conflicted here, because I really enjoyed the characters, writing, & thematic content of this one. It's a book I certainly recommend, as it reminded me of a fascinating take on a "The Giver" type story. The problem I had is that the disparate parts didn't quite come together for me into a fully realized book. I think probably it should have been either shorter or longer, but there's something about the various components that aren't wholly cohesive. That said, I enjoyed my time with it despite that critique & I would read more from this author
