I guess I have changed. I have my little paperback copy I got and read years ago. And of course I found it after I bought the one with the cool boot on the front 🙄Anyway, I loved the book so much back then and now it's just meh! I still love the movie but something just didn't get me as pulled in as before. Oh well. It's still good. Mel ❤️
