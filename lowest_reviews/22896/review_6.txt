I read The Rules of Magic a few years ago without having read this one which was written before it. I was recently thinking about Alice Hoffman’s new novel Magic Lessons to be published in October, 2020, and I decided that I should read this one before I get to the advanced copy that I am fortunate enough to have. I discovered that it didn’t really matter when in time I was reading about the Owens family because I loved them all the same, no matter which generation. I needed a little of Alice Hoffman’s magic, both the magic in the story and the magic of her writing. I was drawn to the Aunts and to Gillian and Sally, their two young nieces that they take in when they become orphaned and later to Sally’s daughters. As odd as this family is and as eerie as the story can feel at times, it’s delightful and full of heart and love, and of course, magic - just what I needed right now. Hoffman is such a prolific and versatile writer and I’ve read several others . I’m glad I have many more of her books yet to read .
