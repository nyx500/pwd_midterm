just like every other reviewer im going to say the movie is better. i think i enjoyed this more than most, in the beginning i was having fun getting to know the characters and pointing out the differences from the movie but the farther i got into the book the more i started to realize they have two different storylines. i just feel like the movie writers made the right choices cus nothing happened. this wasn’t as fun in the sense of the relationships and their use of magic. i mean for a slice of life i did like this more than i typically like books with no plot (i don’t). i heard the other books are better so i’m very excited. finally, i just want to say that these chapters are long as shit omg.
