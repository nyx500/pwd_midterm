I absolutely adored this. Practical Magic is just that: MAGIC!I was so captivated, I was able to read it in a weekend. The writing is beautiful. Hoffman has such a pleasing style; just gorgeous. This was the first novel that I have read of hers and it definitely will not be the last.It is quite different from the movie version, but stands strong in its own right. I did picture Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman in my head the whole time though. In short, if you haven't read this, you should!
