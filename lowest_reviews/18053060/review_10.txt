Here's an actual review by my blog partner, who was able to force herself to finish this, and not a moment too soon because I've been putting it off all day and I just can't. Here's what I have to briefly say: at first the writing was so perfect for me that I likened it to none other than Stacia Kane and I was wrong. What made me think of the similarity was that the opening was completely amazing, the relationship Amy has with her mother was heart breaking, and the way Amy was treated at school was going to break my heart. I like it when an author rips my heart out and I was expecting that, but as time went on I discovered I was so far off base that I couldn't even see the field anymore. INSTA ALL THE THINGS! I mean, really. There can be no confusion here, it's all Nox this, and Nox that, and it's so painfully forced that I never once felt anything beyond annoyance (and I know she mentions their connection at some point, but I didn't write it down and I'm too lazy to find it right now, but it's there). There was a nice little side character thrown in solely for the purpose of making Amy jealous too which was just awesome. Just, nothing worked because it all tried so effing hard, and since the story seems to be a typical YA love drama with a side of plot I'm not longer interested.
