"Stories are always born from something."°•*⁀➷I enjoyed this so much. A dark fairytale, entertaining and witchy, and perfect for Halloween reading.Lexi is headstrong and living in a world that doesn't give her the opportunities she deserves. So she does everything she can to prove that she's worthy of them. When a mysterious stranger comes to town and children start disappearing, she's positive she can find out where they are and why they're being taken. So she takes to the night, and... falls in love. Following her journey through this mystery was fun, spooky, and enchanting. And we love to see an insightful young girl prove everyone in town wrong.There's a certain kind of magic to a book that has so much hate in it, but shows you that love always ends up prevailing in the end.- Paige
