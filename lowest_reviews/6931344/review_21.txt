Schwab herself calls this book “quiet and strange”, and it is true. There isn’t a clear place in the market for it. Perhaps because of that, it feels more like a whimsical, timeless story than any of her others. It could just as easily be written ten years ago or fifty years ago. I found myself thinking it would make an excellent movie, something gothic by Guillermo del Toro perhaps. Because this book has so much ATMOSPHERE. Schwab’s writing style is a bit more florid than usual, and I‘m a big fan of it. It evokes the desolate but powerful beauty of the British moors, which is something I’ve never seen in any book (beside the Bronte novels), and I loved it. On the flip side, there were some things that rubbed me the wrong way. One of the reasons it’s so hard to pin down genre-wise is because I *assume* it’s fantasy, but it could also be British magical fabulism set in a timeless era in the past. Yet the names felt too contemporary for it to be a historical novel, or even a fantasy, which led me assume it was a contemporary fantasy at first. It could still be, who knows. Names such as Lexi and Cole and Tyler didn’t seem to fit the story as in my mind they’re too ... new. (But then again, I have problems with Schwab’s naming in all of her very first books until Vicious, lol.) The romance was very quickly developed, but one could argue for a book less than 300 pages, it’s to be expected. I also don’t think it should have been sold as YA originally either; the characters are teens, but it really doesn’t feel like any standard YA novel, in my opinion. It’s too whimsical and fairytale-esque for that, and those books fare better sold generically as “adult” fantasy. Really though, I loved it. It has the strange, magical, gothic feel I prize as a reader and enjoy seeing in books.  Thank you Titan Books for an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review!
