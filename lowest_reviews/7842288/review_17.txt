Beautiful Darkness is a very much appropriate title.Beautiful Darkness started very dark. The darkness of melancholy, grief and sorrow. And I can't blame Lena for being so emotional with the loss. I knew the feeling, to be honest. Then the following chapters continued to go dark. Darkness as in real darkness. There are interesting characters that has been summoned in this second book of the Beautiful Creatures series:LIV: She is actually my favorite in here. Her wit and knowledge contributed a lot for the sake of Ethan. At first, I considered her as a normal girl but it turned out she's not. JOHN BREED: I won't tell you what exactly he was but he's different. And my mind had this commotion right now thinking if he is in good side or not.ABRAHAM RAVENWOOD: The pioneer. The starter. *insert swear words*LEAH: A badass Succubus. And other new interesting characters like Lucille that has a vital role in the story.Okay, I almost forgot. There are lot of mysteries slash revelations slash twists slash turns slash revelations again that made me think my brain is a time bomb ticking ready to explode. What sorcery is this! I can't contain what I've found out at first but in the end I managed to enclosed it in my brain. Actually, a lot of times I witnessed myself swearing.I really enjoyed the book and the feeling it Casted on me. :)
