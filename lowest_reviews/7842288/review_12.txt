Rating: 5 StarsMy Opinion of this Book: WOW. This one definitely surprised me. A lot of improvement over the first book.__________________________________________________I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this book. Yeah, the first book was good, but that's it, it was just good.  I couldn't get into Beautiful Creatures  until over the 250 page mark, it was so slowwwwww. The ending on that one is what saved the book for me. But damn was I shocked when I read Beautiful Darkness! Sure, it took me a long time to read, but that's because I didn't want this book to end.  I was hooked from the start and incredibly amazed by everything about this book.THE GOOD. ●The Plot/Storyline: In the small southern town where nothing ever happened, everthing was suddenly crazy ever since Ethan Wate met Lena Duchannes, who showed him a secret world that was hidden right there all along. Curses, ancient secrets.After Lena suffers a tragic loss, she starts to pull away from Ethan, while he has strange visions that just bring him deeper into Gaitlin's scary history. Will their relationship go back to the normal? This book was definitely more fast-paced than the first and filled with unexpected plot twists and a cliffhanger ending that will leave you dying for more! ●Ethan Wate: In the genre of YA, we don't see much of male POVs, and I am so glad that this one goes against the typical and has Ethan as our main character. I, personally, enjoy male POVs more than that of a females for some reason. And Ethan is no expectation! I absolutely adore him -his manners, his curiosity, his intelligence, etc. In my opinion, he's one of the best voices in YA. He's also definitely swoon-worthy.●John Breed: He's evil and everything bad, but how can you not like him? I mean, in the famous words of TayTay: "He's so bad but he does it so well." ~Wildest Dreams ●Link: Linkkkkkkk! This guy can lighten up the room and make people crack a smile even in the darkest times. Seriously, though, he's hilarious. Definitely a well crafted character!●Riley: We're used to seeing this cold-hearted side of Riley, but in this one we see a whole different side of her. We see this broken, wanting, girl. She still has her sassy moments though. I actually really liked her.●The Writing: The writing is just so -ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS. These authors can never do me wrong with their writing. It's just so good and fitting. ●The Ending: Such a surprise! Definitely a cliffhanger a.k.a. I need to get my hands on the next book!!THE BAD. ●Lena: I'm sorry, but she was so whiny and annoying, like no, just stop. It's a good thing that she redeemed herself in the end though. OVERALL. I'd recommend this series, even though the first one may seem a bit dull, but you just have to continue with the series and it definitely gets better!
