Actual rating 3.75/5 stars.I really surprised myself by how much I found myself enjoying this story. The prologue held no appeal for me. It seemed a classic case of telling not showing and I worried for my enjoyment during the rest of the book if this unemotional start was anything to judge this by.Thankfully this did pick up, although I was still not fully invested. I found the early dialogue very contrived and seemed to be largely created to fill the reader in on facts, rather than feel like authentic discussions that were occurring between the characters.100 pages in and all my early reservations were appeased as I was submerged in the intricacies of the narrative. There were some ballsy and unprecedented twists that affirmed my quickly emerging adoration with this, even more. The plot was both an intriguing continuation of the Snow White fairy tale, used as its basis, as well as cleverly incorporating iconic imagery and scenes that heightened my enjoyment and had me puzzling to solve its many mysteries. The death and destruction in this novel really touched a nerve with me. As the novel progressed the action was heightened and I was entirely glued to the last half of this book.
