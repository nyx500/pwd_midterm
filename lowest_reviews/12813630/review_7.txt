3.5/5Not bad! I'm glad that I finally got around to reading this as it's been on my shelf for FOREVER. I really enjoyed the beginning of this book, but towards the middle it slowed down and I began to lose interest. The concept of vampirism in this book was also sort of confusing to me, with "the cold" and how you don't necessarily have to become a vampire if you get infected. I'm used to the straightforward "get bitten, become vampire" type of thing and this world with coldtowns and whatnot unfortunately kept me from getting completely into the story. Also, I listened to an audiobook version, which I should have learned by now that it's not my thing. I usually dislike the narrator (like in this case, the voice never matches up with what I imagine the voices being) and it's easy for me to zone out and miss big events. Despite all of these negatives, I did really enjoy the writing style and the action and I loved how it was just one novel instead of a trilogy. What a breath of fresh air!
