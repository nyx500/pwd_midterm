I LOVED this book! I listened to the audiobook and the narrator did an amazing job. There isn't much new or fresh in the way of vampire lore here, but I thought it was an exceptionally well done vampire story. I loved Black's exquisite writing and excellent characterisation, which gave the story a feel of both modern and gothic decadence and decline. For me, it struck exactly the right balance.I see that my GR friends are a bit divided on this one. I think if you are someone who really likes vampire books, you will enjoy this. It's an excellent addition to the genre.
