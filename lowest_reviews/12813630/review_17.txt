“Every hero is the villain of his own story.”I made it my job to read every Holly Black book on the face of this earth. And what could be better than Holly Black and Vampires? damn, this book was good. I say this a lot but this was so incredibly different!Vampires and modern technology. I mean imagine sitting in the comfort of your home and watching shows about Vampire hunters, Vampire wannabes and Vampires trying to lure you to the dark side. Crazy right? Truthfully, I really missed Vampire books. It has been such a long time since I’ve picked one up. The storyline was pretty simple but the twist at the end was quite intriguing. The writing is especially loved. and the morbid quotes at the beginning of each chapter (yes I know what you’re thinking)I really liked Tana. I loved how she managed to be a complete badass throughout the entire book. She clearly didn't wait for anyone to save her from anything. She did all the saving. Including saving a Vampire which confused me a whole lot. Why would you even do that? but then again Tana is just weird like that.“Even from the beginning, that was the problem. People liked pretty things. People even liked pretty things that wanted to kill and eat them.”Gavriel was completely insane. There’s no better way to describe him. Vampires are psychos and this guy wasn’t very far. I mean he was sweet and he had his moments. Honestly, I laughed so much when it came to him.“You are more dangerous than daybreak.”Aidan was strange. He was so weird when he became a Vampire. I suppose the crazy caught up to him. Winter and Midnight weren't my favorites if I’m honest. I just thought they were insane. Clearly everyone in this book was. Aside from how weird everyone was I pretty much enjoyed the book. It was slow paced but it didn't bother me. I think I was just really in the mood for this book. I ended up finishing it in 2 days.
