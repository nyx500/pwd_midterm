3.75 starsBefore I read this book, I had no idea what it was about. I just know two things that made me want it; that it has witches and it got such an aesthetic beautiful cover. And I was sold!This was such an enjoyable book to read. Starting from the gothic atmosphere, the sinister dark vibe, the relevant theme, the feminism, the cute love story, and the relatable realistic topics. I really liked both the main characters, even though they were kinda basic, I was still cheering for them the whole time. The pacing was so good making the book so readable. My only little complain is that I would’ve preferred if it was an adult book. In my opinion, being a YA book prevented it from reaching its full potential. I’m not saying it wasn’t good, I just think it could’ve been more. And even though this was so atmospheric, the world building was kinda lacking as well. Overall, this was a really decent debut.Song recommendation:Bad moon rising by Creedence Clearwater RevivalA little wicked by Valerie BroussardSeven devils by Florence + The machine
