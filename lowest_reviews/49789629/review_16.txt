ETA: I'm changing the rating I gave this book from a 3 to at least a 4 because I just can't get it out of my head.I'm feeling all kinds of ways about this book. I'm just gonna high light the stuff I liked and hated. You can go read the blurb or another review if you want to know more of what the actual book is about.Liked list:Witches!! Some of my very favorite things.These witches aren't the kind that just want a boyfriend either. These are some dark heifers. It's very readable. I liked the storyline and I actually liked the main characters. It's set in a secluded village that you are not allowed to leave. But our girl of course wanders into the dark forbidden forest. Where she meets guess what?? Witches!!! Okay so I just love witches. Let's move on.She gets her dead mother's journal from one of those witches and learns that her little town is in for a hot mess. She starts kinda poking around and realizes that she might have to be the one to save the town. I do not know if I would bother because to be honest...the town is full of turds and a crazy ass preacher man.This stuff was all my cup of tea. Then the stuff I didn't like.I know. I bitch about politics in books all the time. I really try and pick books that are not filled with them. I mean damn. The last few years have been shit. Especially this year. I just want to read to fill my mind with fluff. If you can tell I'm not out to be the smartest fart in town and I'm not looking to change that award winning status.Anyways, I went with a three. It's a good book. I ain't hating.Booksource: Netgalley in exchange for review.
