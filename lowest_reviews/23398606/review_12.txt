www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comWhat a darktastic ride through wonderland accept... this isn't the wonderland most may be used to... this place is called Old City and it's not somewhere you want to find yourself. Years ago Alice went from her home in New City with a supposed friend into Old City out of stupidity if you ask me....only Alice came out... and dear Alice was never the same again. Alice is put in a mental hospital in the Old City by her parents for the rest of her life. You see you can't have crazy in New City, you have to be perfect there. And poor Alice who kept screaming about a rabbit and had been attacked in a most horrible way was labeled crazy. Alice has one friend in the asylum and his name is Hatcher. After so many long years in the asylum, one night there is a fire and they escape, but so does a creature that is out to destroy everything in his path. This book is full of darkness. There isn't anything sweet or cutsie about it. People and things are slayed, raped, twisted, changed, sold, bought... you get the picture. BUT. Alice finds out she has power beyond her imagination and she is pretty bad to the bone and so is Hatcher. I really liked all of the things Alice and Hatcher go through together. I love their characters. I love all of the things they do all in the name of vengeance. There is nothing like getting revenge on those that have hurt you and avenge other innocents that have been hurt. A brilliant, bloody-ride through Old City with a little spark of goodness at the end. So, I guess I lied, there is a little ray of sunshine ;)
