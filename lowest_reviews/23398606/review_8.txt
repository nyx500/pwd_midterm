3.5 ⭐️ “I wish I were a magician…I’d find all those lost girls and bring them home. I’d take all those men who hurt those girls and make them cry.” Woah. This adds an entire new dimension to the word dark. If you can think of something gruesome, or violent, or harrowing – it’s probably in this book.I read Lost Boy by Christina Henry, and although that story contained murder, and fighting and battle, it wasn’t nearly on the same scale as Alice was. This bordered on horror, for me at least.Alice and Hatcher met while in a mental institution. Both have committed horrific crimes, though Alice can remember very little of her past – something to do with a rabbit, and being kidnapped. When the chance for them to escape arises, they grasp it with both hands and leg it. However, a shadow monster – the Jabberwocky, has also escaped the institution, and seems to be following them.Alice and Hatcher must find a way to destroy the Jabberwocky, passing through the many areas of the Old City, meeting some familiar characters – but not as you would remember them. Alice is a far cry from the timid young girl we know from Lewis Carroll’s stories and from Disney. This Alice has seen some horrors, and will do whatever necessary to survive.I did find this book entertaining, albeit slightly sickening in places, I’ll say I still preferred Lost Boy, as it remained truer to the original story than this one did. But I liked it enough that I will order the sequel from the library, and see what happens to Alice and Hatcher next. “She must start believing in impossible things, for impossible things kept appearing before her eyes.”
