Hmm. Where to start? This book was quite unique and strange. I love me a good vampire tale and this certainly was one- vampires are at the centre of the actions of the story. And yet...the point of the book seemed to be more about the world building. This was a fascinating world with many magics and part blood demons, ward makers and charm weavers, a special Others police force... But while it was fascinating in places, the book seemed to be almost a long information dump. If this was the first in a series, this would make more sense, but Sunshine is a stand- alone. It was frustrating to me that we did not learn more about Constantine. He is alien, aloof, cold, as one might expect from a vampire and yet hard to get a handle on.I thought Sunshine was a great character in an urban fantasy setting different to many others in tone as much as geography. The book felt wordy but this may have to do with my tiny print mass market paperback and my dodgy eyesight and not McKinley's writing!Did I like this book? I don't know. Did I like reading another and different take on vampires? Very much.
