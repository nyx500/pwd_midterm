4.5 stars - I really enjoyed this. We find ourselves in a world that seems a bit like ours, but with demons and were-people (werewolves, were-skunks and even were-chickens!), and the most evil “others”; vampires, as well as human magic-handlers, ward creators (that’s not the right word, but I can’t find the term) and part-bloods and a government agency to handle all of them, Others and special humans.I won’t say more, because that would be spoilery. McKinley balances the darkness of events with humor and self-deprecation and real kindness and compassion. The story unfolds in quite a logical way, despite completely bizarre and illogical things happening to our MC. The ending is pretty good closure, but leaves a door open a crack for one’s own speculation or an actual sequel, which at this point, I’m uncertain will be forthcoming. The narration is quite well done. I was mildly distracted by Merlington’s voice, accent and delivery being uncannily similar to Kate Mulgrew’s. Like a younger sister, but I know they are not at all related. Both grew up in the Midwest, at about the same time, but Iowa and Michigan have slightly different accents. I’m not sure any of that could account for the similarities. I enjoyed her narration nevertheless.
