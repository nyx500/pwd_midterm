This prison is alive.That pretty much sums up Incarceron's selling point. It's probably even a better marketing line than the book's actual hook, "a prison like no other"â€”which could really mean just about anything, from a prison made of pineapples and everything-bagels to a prison in which the cells are made of popular song lyrics to a prison that is an exact replica of the First Continental Congress. At least with "This prison is alive," you have a pretty good idea of what's special about the book and why you'll want to read it.It's a really cool idea and the prison Catherine Fischer builds in her story is worth exploring.It's just too bad the rest of the story isn't as awesome as the premise of a prison that is basically a person. Her characters are those we've met a thousand times before and they act in all the silly ways that we've come to expect from paper-thin caricatures. They even come with prepackaged sci-fi names like Finn and Keiro and Sapphique. (Sapphique?) All the novel's surprises are telegraphed in such a way that the reader wonders why Fischer even bothered making them surprises, as if she included them reluctantly, having heard somewhere that stories required twists and turns but all the while thought better of it. It's not that Incarceron is particularly bad. It's more just a matter of being too pedestrian, too common. This prison is alive is a concept so full of life and possibility and I wish so much that it had a great book to go along with it. Fischer will occasionally prompt interesting questions, speculating on the nature of the human beast and the purpose and power of the human institution, but those moments of interest would do better being shored up by a more powerful author.Maybe for her next book, she can accumulate all her interesting ideas and then sell them to someone with a better talent for literature.
