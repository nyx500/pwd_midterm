"Year by year Incarceron tightened its grip. It made a hell of what should have been Heaven." Loved revisiting this world! I read this first when I was in my teens and I remember enjoying it wholeheartedly; years later and that opinion hasn't changed!Claudia lives in a dystopian future, where there have been such advances in technology and science, but the leaders have chosen to keep the world frozen in history. They have chosen a medieval time period, and everything must be kept in 'era'.Meanwhile, Finn lives in Incarceron. A vast and terrifying prison, where no one can escape, and the prison itself is growing, and learning, and destroying. The only person supposedly to have escaped is Sapphique; a legend with an entire belief system built around him.I loved this world, it is unlike any I've come across before. It is clever, and believable. I found Claudia pretty damn irritating most of the time, but I loved Finn and his oathbrother Keiro, and their friend Attia.Overall a solid old school YA :)
