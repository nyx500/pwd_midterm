Here we are at the very end of the series, THANK FUCK ITS ENDED. Now you may be thinking: Zoe, how could Twilight get any worse?I am about to go on for a good 3 pages and tell you exactly how.SOME SHIT WENT DOWNNN IN THIS BOOK SO I HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT!!!Warning: There will be spoilers and swearing in this review. I'm sure you already know their names but if ya dont here ya go:Edward: Mr Light Bulb. Because apparently vampires sparkle in the sun now instead of burning?Bella: Little Miss Dumb: Because well aparently someone who wants you for your blood is attractive? Hmph, I don’t think so.Jacob: Fuzz balls: I don’t think I need to explain. Soooooooooooooooo, this book is exactly 754 pages of me laughing at how amazing Stepheine Meyer is for thinking all of this is a good idea. Yes, I counted! OK! YOUR WELCOME!!SOOOOOOOOOOOOO. SOME SHIT GOES DOWN IN THIS BOOK AND WOWEE DOES IT GET ON MY NERVES. So, Little Miss Dumb and Light Bulb are getting married *crowd cheers* AND SHE IS 18 YEARS OLD MARRYING AN OLD MAN IN A TEENAGERS BODY *crowd boos*HOW IN THE WORLD HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER ARE OK WITH THAT IS WAYYYYY OVER MY HEAD. AND SOOOO THEY get married ALL BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO DIE AND THEN COME BACK ALIVE FOR HIM SOOOOOOO THEN THEY GET MARRIED AND OFF THEY GO ON THEIR HONEYMOON.HOW TF DID HER DAD AGREE TO THIS??!!Anyways they go off on their HONEYMOON and DO THE DEVILS TANGO. *EVIL LAUGH* Not even a DAY after they do the devils tango she eats some chicken and vomits. NOT THINKING IT COULD BE UNDERCOOKED OR MAYBE IT WAS FOOD POISONING. She's like ‘OH SHIT I'M PREGNANT’. BRO THE SWIMMERS CAN’T SWIM THAT FAST. CALM TF DOWN.Now you might be wondering WHY she thinks that a human girl can get pregnant from AN IMMORTAL SPARKLING VAMPIRE?!?!!!!????ANDDDD THEN Light Bulb goes into shock AND TURNS INTO A HUMAN VAMPIRE ROCK!!!Then DUN DUN DUNNNNNNN they go home and Carlile is like MISS DUMB IS PREGNANT FOR REALS Then Miss Dumb DOESNT TELL HER DAD SHE IS PREGNANT.THEN WE GET SO LONG OF HER BEING PREGNANT AND THE BABYS A VAMPIRE SO SHE DRINKS BLOOD *Vomits* AND SHE LIKES IT AND DRINKS IT LIKE I DRINK MY COFFEE. THEN SHE GETS SO FAT FROM THE BABY BUT DOESN’T GIVE UP BC ITS SPESHUL AND NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS.Like mother like daughterAND THEN HER SPINE BREAKS AND WHILE IN A ROOM FULL OF BLOODSUCKERS SHE GIVES BIRTH TO A HUMAN/VAMPIRE AND NO ONE KILLS HER OR THE BABYTalk about unrealistic.AND THEN SHE DIES (DUN DUN DUN) BUT WAIT, VAMPIRES CAN BRING HER BACK TO LIFESO LIGHT BULB BITES HER (admit it buddy you’ve always wanted to eat her like a snack)And she sleeps peacefully painfully. Then she awakes and SHE HAS RED EYES. And they go for a run (pretty dumb for a newborn vampire)And Miss Dumbs like: OMFG I LOVE BEING DEAD!!!!I can run FAST I can SMELL HOW BAD EVERYONE ISI look even paler (if that's possible) AND NOW I CRAVE BLOOD Anddddddd, she smells fresh blood from a rock climber and is like DANG I NEED A TASTE OF THAT FRESH YUMMMMMYYYYY BLOOD. BUT WAIT BECAUSE SHE IS SPESHUL AND IS NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS SHE RESISTS JUST BECOMING A VAMPIRE AND RUNS AWAY FROM FRESH BLOOD. ANDDD THEN SHE:Beats Emmet in a hand restleAnd nearly kills Fuzz BallsNow you are probably thinking, where has Fuzz Balls been this whole time?Well remember when Bella gave birth to her child?AND YESSS THE NAME IS RENESMEE (BISHHHHH what name is that????!!!!)And then remember when she was in a coma after Light Bulbs venom got rid of her humanity?Well yea, that whole time, Fuzz Balls was adoring Bellas daughter and IMPRINTED ON HER (AKA making her his mate) Yes, THE WHOLE REASON FUZZ BALLS WAS ATTRACTED TO BELLA BECAUSE THERE WAS ONE EGG INSIDE OF BELLA THAT HE WAS GONNA IMPRINT ONAnd because of that we get the iconic line “YOU IMPRINTED ON MY DAUGHTER!??!?!”And “ YOU NAMED MY DAUGHTER AFTER THE LOCH-NESS MONSTER?!?!?”And then the happy couple get into a fight with the vampire baby government bc there daughter is illegal. And there is this whole fight lalalallalla. But I dont care about that. So after all of that Miss Dumb and Light Bulb go off to a cabin because the family did not want to hear them do the devils tango because they can now do that without Light Bulb killing Miss Dumb. This book was by FAR the worst out of all of them and I can’t believe I ever read this TWICE. Young Zoe was not a good Zoe.PS.
