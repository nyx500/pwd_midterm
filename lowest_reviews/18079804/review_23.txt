For some parts I was likeBy the end I was not wowed by this one. I think it started of well and towards the middle it got boring. Only like the last 25% of the book at the end was a bit enjoyable. I think what lacked for me was the world building. All that we find out is the catagories of witches and their abilities and oh yeah there is no magic. It's a bit plotless.I know I said I appreciated the language but by 30% into the book I started to get annoyed by it. Yeah it bit me in the back! I also think that maybe some multiple povs would do well... I did feel sorry for Nathan... But I found this book to also be lacking emotions. Oh and not forgetting a lot of this book had lots of pointless lines like what Nathan's doing repeatedly. Despite this I did enjoy it. I honestly think it was a great start to the series and I know it will improve. l liked the part where the guy is telling Nathan abt his tattoos. Oh and yes the famous OTP! $hip! $hip! $hip!A little disappointed though. Maybe book 2 will be better. Oh and the climax was not climatic.
