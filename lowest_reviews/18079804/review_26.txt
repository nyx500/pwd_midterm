This will become your new obsession come March. Trust.Between this and Red Rising the SFF YA landscape is changing, and for the better. It will be hard for me read other YA novels this year that do not live up to this level of storytelling and craftsmanship and I imagine my DNF list to grow exponentially because of it.Half Bad is as good, if not better, than most of the adult fantasy I read. Think Sanderson, Rothfuss, Weeks, Ryan, etc. This book is excellent and I have no doubt that it will become the huge deal it deserves to be. Sally Green has written an entertaining, smart and epic first novel and I am going to find it impossible to wait for book 2.
