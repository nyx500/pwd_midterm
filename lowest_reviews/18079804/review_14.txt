This book read more like an overlong prologue than the actual first installment in a series. The whole thing is about the MC finally getting his powers, which he does at the end. I’m not even going to put that in a spoiler alert because it doesn’t need one. The book is very predictable so it also should come as no surprise that he gains them from his father, a *gasp* Black witch.I have a problem with these terms: “Black” and “White” witches. They aren’t clearly defined in the story other than saying Black witches are violent and kill people, but plenty of White ones are just as cruel and also murder people. The whole drama is about hunting down and wiping out Black witches, and keeping those who could be Black witches from gaining their powers. While there is some backstory provided about how they came about, the fact that there is a serious lack of clarity, ironically over something black and white, seems ill thought out.Further, the writing is unpolished, and by that I mean rough. And by rough, I mean ROUGH DRAFT rough. And by that I mean plenty of errors and entire passages that seemed like more of an outline than actual storytelling. Ben Horslen is thanked at the end for being Sally Green’s editor but he did a horrendous job. It seems like a middle schooler wrote it and a lazy teacher gave them a passing grade just for turning it in. I notice this trend more and more in traditionally published books that supposedly went through editors, but the quality and content of the work don’t seem to prove that any actual proofreading was done.Moving past that, the actual story is entertaining and fast-paced. It’s a tale of prejudice, abuse, bureaucracy, and magic. It’s weirdly gritty and unsettlingly gentle at times; it’s very modern.
