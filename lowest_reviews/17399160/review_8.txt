Warning: This review is a crazy ass mess, like seriously. Is this even a review???4.5 I FUCKING LOVE MATHER STARS. THERON IS GREAT, BUT LIKE,, MATHER ALL THE WAY.*screams for a year or so*I didn't expect this to so so so good. Honestly I'm mind blown and so amazed! This book was fucking captivating from the start and had me hooked the entire time. Whoever said the world building was 10/10 was right. I HATE love triangles with a passion, but this book did it so fucking well. Even though I was annoyed AF at times I loved it. This book is fucking awesome and I cannot even function right now. "Even the strongest blizzard starts with a single snowflake."LISTEN TO ME. *points at you* GET YOUR ASS TO READ THIS MASTERPIECE. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON LIFE. This book has me shook, you guys I can't even explain how badly I fucking loved this. I was super excited for this one and I'm so so fucking happy this turned out super awesome. Like, I'm exploding with all these feels man. Everything about this book is perfection. The world building is freaking amazing. I LOVE THE FUCKING CHARACTERS. #MATHERALLTHEWAYFUCKERS. I know some people had problems with Meira because she was a "special snow flake" but I, honestly loved her character. She was strong and kickass and ASJKBHSAHKJFBGSDI I liked her. One small problem I had with this book was THE FUCKING LOVE TRIANGLE, which was extremely well done, BUT ANNOYING AS FUCK WHEN YOU REALLY LIKE BOTH GUYS, BUT FUCKING MATHER ALL THE WAY BECAUSE. Listen Sara Raasch knows how to write a fucking love triangle and she write it fucking good. I LIKED BOTH OF THE GUYS WHICH MADE ME REALLY SAD BECAUSE THEN SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE AND IF SHE CHOOSES ONE IT BETTER BE MATHER BECAUSE I'M GOING TO FLIP A TABLE. I CRI. GOODBYE GOODBYE.SO OVERALL YOU SHOULD PICK THIS BOOK UP. I DON'T CARE WHAT OTHERS SAY, IT'S GREAT. GO READ IT.I NEED THE NEXT BOOK BC THAT FUCKING LOVE TRIANGLE IS SLOWLY KILLING ME. I. NEED. TO. KNOW. WHO. SHE. ENDS. UP. WITH. FUCK.The words in capslock are obviously me screaming bc I have issues.***The blurb sounds so good and the cover is so pretty and I swear to God, if this turns out to be a disappointment I'm going to cry in a corner and eat my doorknob while ripping the pages out of this book bc I'm SUPER pumped and excited for this.
