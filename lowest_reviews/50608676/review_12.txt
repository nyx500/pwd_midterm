Blood, Sex and MagicIf you’re not put off by the violence and gross bits, then it’s a perfectly normal epic quest adventure.The plot is like a wild run amuck-garden full of enchantment and evil. The writing is lush almost to the point texture or smell. Equally true for the sensual application of clay as for the torture by those hyena-bitches.The narrative fragments in places, but some people like it when the camera shakes. Besides, the fellows are cute with their jealous fight and the buffalo is as smart as Lassie.
