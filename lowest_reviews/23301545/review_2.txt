I've read so many versions of fairy tales that it takes a really interesting spin(dle) (ha) for me to enjoy. Unfortunately, this was not the caseThe best part - how Gaiman takes the fairy tale characters and weaves them into a new-old story. “You don’t need princes to save you. I don’t have a lot of patience for stories in which women are rescued by men."Yes, there's a sleeping beauty but she's nothing is like the original story. Yes, there's a Snow White, but gone is the calm Disney gal. Learning how to be strong, to feel her own emotions and not another's, had been hard; but once you learned the trick of it, you did not forget.However.... the whole story had a very lackluster feel to it. Maybe it's because I've read too many versions of fairytales but I just wasn't wowed.  It has too many lines like this: But the path to her death, heartbeat by heartbeat, would be inevitable. or this: It would be the end of her life, she decided, if life was a time of choices. which (of course) made everything ridiculously and overwhelmingly dramatic... which is one sure way to take me out of the story. And I didn't feel the romance - for some reason, I went on thinking that this would be a lesbian retelling of sleeping beauty. Boy was I wrong.  I really wanted to see that build/emotional development and the was absolutely nothing. Hugely disappointed. Overall, this one was alright. Annnd that's about as positive as I can get.
