MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading ListI got this book from the library but I can tell you it is going to be added to my bookshelves as I must have it. The story is so different and dark and good. The graphics are AMAZING!Queen Snow White doesn't seem too happy in her current situation, she is to be wed and have babies and do this and do that.........until one day, three of her dwarfs tell her about a land where everyone is asleep...and the queen who is ready for some adventure, or so it seems, heads out to see what this nonsense is all about! Queen Snow and the dwarfs arrive at the castle and find (just like they said) everyone asleep. There seems to be one old lady there that is watching over the Sleeping Beauty. She has been there for many years while the beauty slept. Until along came Snow, who isn't a prince but a Queen, and wakes her up. We find out all is not as it seems as the Beauty wakes up. There is evilness afoot!! But alas, things are set to rights and the Queen and her dwarfs set out on their way... but the Queen is unsure of what she wants... and then the decision is made... I must say once again that I LOVE THIS BOOK! And I am sooooo glad I got it from the library... to think I wasn't even going to bother.. OH when you think your not going to bother with something, that you might not like it or have the time...BOTHER WITH IT, trust me, you might find a little gem or a big gem depending on how you look at it. :-)
