this book has the most beautiful cover i have ever seen in my LIFE. and beautiful black-and-white illustrations. and it's a fairytale retelling. and it's by neil gaiman. and it's short.i have loved books for all of those reasons alone. like, by neil gaiman? done. pretty? done. illustrated? done. short? done. fairytale-y? doooooone.SO WHY DIDN'T I LOVE THIS ONE, WHICH HAD ALL OF THOSE THINGS.it just didn't feel particularly any of those things, i guess. the writing was meh for neil gaiman. everything was confusing because it was so short. there were some moments of tension that were gone within a paragraph. not enough worldbuilding, or character-building, or anything -building. NOT ENOUGH ANYTHING, REALLY.i guess that's what you get when a book is under 70 pages and, like, half illustrations?still. seanan mcguire would never.bottom line: this was a massive disappointment but i'm still going to gaze lovingly at the cover for the next 3-5 business days because ohmygodlookatit.
