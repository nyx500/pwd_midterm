“The path to her death, heartbeat by heartbeat, would be inevitable.” A wonderful book with beautiful illustrations and a new perspective on our most beloved fairytales.I'm not a big fan of Gaiman's writing, I guess. Would this be the same artist but a different author, say Laini Taylor or Catherynne M. Valente, this could have been as magical and wondrous as I had wished it.Find more of my books on Instagram
