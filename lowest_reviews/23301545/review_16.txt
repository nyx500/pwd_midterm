Ideal Christmas present alert! However old your kids are, buy this for them. If they don’t like it, you might want to think seriously about disinheriting them, because it will show they have no heart, no eye for beauty and no sense of humour. And you don’t wanna empower people like that, really. They might be sociopaths. Those with no kids - yeah, buy it for each other.The art by Chris Riddell is so stunning, every other page is a gobsmacker, and it helps that the young (nameless) queen kind of looks a bit like Jessica Jones as played by Krysten Ritterand the retelling of Sleeping Beauty by Neil Gaiman is wry and has dwarves.
