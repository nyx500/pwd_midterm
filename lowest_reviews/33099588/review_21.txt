4.5 starsIâ€™m so glad I finally started this series! The Black Tides of Heaven is a fantasy novella about complex sibling relationships, politics , and identity. All set in a world where children are not assigned a gender at birth, instead choosing one for themselves when they are ready. The story spans years but focuses in on the children of a single family. Filled with magic, danger, intrigue, prophecy, and love this is definitely worth picking up. And Yangs prose is gorgeous, a pleasure to read.
