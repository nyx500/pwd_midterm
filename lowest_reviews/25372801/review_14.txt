4.25ish stars.Bizarre, insightful, quirky, and unique in its examination of the relationships between and within science, nature and humanity.Laurence and Patricia as characters are weird, dumb, and oh so real. Every step of the way I was shaking my head at them, laughing at them, rolling my eyes, screaming at them in my head and rooting for them until the end.The novel was at once a small slice of life story about two very different social outcasts AND a giant commentary on the forces of nature and science. It also had a lot to say about humanity as a whole. I wasn't on board the entire way; there were a few points where I thought Anders lost control of the narrative. Things got confusing or too clever for their own good or tried to be too 'big'. And even though I didn't completely get everything at the end, I still came away feeling satisfied and even a little bit inspired.https://mrphilipslibrary.wordpress.co...
