This multiple-award-winning fantasy is Tor's free ebook of the month (Sept. 2018) if you join their free ebook club here: https://www.tor.com/2018/09/18/downlo... If you like fantasy and SF, this is definitely worth doing. No purchase necessary, no commitments, the monthly free ebooks are high quality (usually books I was already interested in), and the weekly Tor newsletters are actually interesting and non-annoying. I highly recommend it if you're a SF/fantasy reader. Tip: Click on the above Tor link from the device that you want to download the ebook to. The free offer is only good through midnight on Sept. 21 (U.S. Eastern Time). Also, apparently it's only available to US/Canada residents, sorry.
