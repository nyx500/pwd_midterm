Imagine 90s Sabrina meets Bewitched set in Halloweentown but as a steamy romance and you have this book!We follow Vivi, who after a summer fling that ended badly, curses the man who broke her heart using a Bath and Body Works candle. Thinking nothing of it, Vivi moves on with her life until Rhys (her ex love), waltzes back into her life 9 years later and it turns out that maybe Vivi's curse worked after all.Honestly this was exactly what I needed - The Ex Hex is a fun page turner filled with pure chaotic energy and immaculate witchy vibes. I adored the romantic elements - Rhys is a smooth, Welsh charmer and I honestly fell in love with him from his first appearance on the page. The chemistry he had with Vivi combined with the top banter and witchy goodness had me very quickly obsessed with this book!Will absolutely read Erin Stirling's next novel and I now have to restrain my self from finding more witchy romance to binge!
