It’s witchy season in Romancelandia!Over the past couple of months, I’ve read the word grimoire so many times it doesn’t mean anything to me anymore, and if I could tell you the amount of errant curses there have been… You would be shocked. But no matter! Because it’s all led me to this delightful rom-com about Vivienne, a History professor witch, and her ex, Rhys, the sexy Welsh travel agent whom she cursed ten years ago with a Bath & Body Works candle.(Are all Welsh romance heroes named Rhys? Do they all call their love interests cariad? Was this directly inspired by Marrying Winterborne? So many questions.)Anyway. Rhys is back to Vivi’s small town of Graves Glen for the first time since the breakup and the curse she placed upon him is suddenly wreaking all sorts of havoc for local witches. Now, they must work together to figure out how to reverse the curse, and not jump each other’s bones in the process (spoiler alert: the latter is not successful).Things you can find in this book:- Errant ghosts- A magical sex cave- A talking cat- A Viagra spell dealer- Multiple haunted housesI laughed, I swooned, I laughed again. The banter between Rhys and Vivi was pitch perfect, and the Halloween vibes were exactly what I wanted to read.
