“Never mix vodka and witchcraft.”That’s the first line of this novel, and it sets the scene quite well.Vivienne “Vivi” Jones had her heart broken 9 years ago. In a drunken state of mind, and with the help of her cousin, she jokingly placed a curse on the man in question. Only it seems the curse actually worked. Oh, and Vivi and her family are witches.Now in present day Graves Glen, Georgia, the cursed man, Rhys Penhallow, is back in town to do some witchy business for Founder’s Day. He and his family are witches too (they don’t call the men wizards anymore). Rhys doesn’t actually realize he’s been cursed until returning to town and coming face to face with Vivi. The chemistry they previously had together instantly presents itself again, as much as Vivi tries to push it away. But when it becomes clear to her that the curse on Rhys extends to the whole town of Graves Glen, she realizes they need to work together to try and banish the evil. They have to deal with a bitchy ghost who should never have been summoned, ankle-biting Halloween toys, spells not working like they’re supposed to, and a cat who can all of a sudden talk. Can they do all of this and save the town while keeping their zippers zipped?Not quite. Zippers become unzipped. This was a fun read...and I timed it very well, finishing it on Halloween. The writing is atmospheric, the sexual tension is...well...tense, and there are some genuine LOL / cute moments. This is a winner from Rachel Hawkins, writing under the name of Erin Sterling. While I probably won’t remember this one too much by next Halloween, it was an enjoyable romp with charming characters and an appealing story. Highly recommend for those who don’t mind a little extra pumpkin “spice” and a whole lotta amusing F-bombs. Happy Halloween! 🎃🧙🧙🧙.🧹 (3.5 stars in layman’s terms)Review also posted at: https://bonkersforthebooks.wordpress.com
