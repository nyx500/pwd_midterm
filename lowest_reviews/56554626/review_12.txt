2021 Fall Bingo (#FallInLoveBingo🍂): WitchesA book about magic should not have bored me to tears. I skimmed the second half because I wasn’t loving the ship. I have spoilery thoughts about the worldbuilding that I won’t discuss (because: spoiler) but I wish the magic system had been fleshed out a little more. I can’t think of anything objectionable about THE EX HEX; I just didn’t vibe with the ship. I didn’t feel excited about their relationship progression. I’m sure other readers can answer the question of “why are Rhys and Vivi a good couple together?” — but I can’t! I never got emotionally invested in the “we accidentally corrupted the ley lines with bad magic” storyline. Ambivalence about a HEA is not a good sign! So: two stars for boredom. I 100% acknowledge that it’s me, not the book (clichéd, I know). Reading other reviews makes it clear that I am a Halloween-themed grinchy anomaly, so disregard this review if the witchy premise appeals to you. THE EX HEX is fine and you’ll likely love it if you’re looking for a Hocus Pocus/Practical Magic-esque romance novel.Also: I am so freaking tired of Harry Potter references. They just make me want to cry. I don’t want a reminder of a fandom that hurts me, okay? I hand-waved the muggle allusion away, but the second reference that lasted AN ENTIRE PAGE really upset me. Disclaimer: I received a free e-ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
