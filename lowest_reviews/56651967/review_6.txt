This book… *shakes head and laughs*I cannot even review this properly.Pros:-vampires-mixed race, bigger (?) mc-was literally so cringe-worthy and terrible that it was funny/entertaining and that was the ONLY thing that kept me readingCons:-read like a literal horrible, cheesy fanfic in the worst way possible-the sex scenes were also not good at all-big “I’m not like the others girls” vibes-corny reincarnation trope (and pretty much any other corny / overused / dried up trope you can think of, this book had it)The very first 10% of the book can be summarized as….Oh I’m a princess of a country but I’m like not a normal princess or girl because I’ve been trained to fight and I can handle myself and I’m capable. I have a sexual relationship with the captain of the guard but he’s boring and not good in the sack and I’m not satisfied. My father the king is meeting the conquering vampire lord and I’m having a fight with my asshole boyfriend and I sneak out on my own and find a feral vampire and it attacks me but I kill it because I’m so capable but I’m injured and this sexy vampire man just so happens to find me in the woods and licks me and heals my wounds but I say he’s an evil creature and he disappears but he made me so horny with horny magic I cannot even think straight and can barely walk home and every brush of my thighs is too much and the next day we meet the vampire lord and he just so HAPPENS to be the vampire I met in the woods that I want to fuck so badly and oh yeah I HAVE to marry him to save my country and this is such a great ordeal because he’s an EVIL CREATURE and disgusting but oh no we have to consummate the marriage whatever will I do!!!I’m not above some good vampire smut books in the right mood but dear god… this was SO BAD. Even with the vampire/forced marriage tropes, there ARE ways to write them and pull it off, but this decidedly failed in every regard.This did not read or feel like a work by a published, popular author, and felt exactly like something you’d read on fan fiction sites as a 13 year old, written by a 14 year old.But hey, at least I could read it in a satirical way, and that was the only thing giving me the strength to finish.Needless to say, it confirmed my worst fears and assumptions and I will NOT be reading any of this author’s other works.
