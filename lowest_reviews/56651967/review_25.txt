you know in fantasy romance books when the main character goes through something life changing that sends her spiraling into hysterics something that has her sobbing crying and throwing up and then...the minute that she stops the male love interest says something like "you know...I've always liked strawberries" and this is exactly why im giving it 2 stars instead of 3 stars cuz you could've been anything but you chose to be a corny mf that can't read the room.
