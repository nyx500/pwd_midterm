THREE THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS BOOK.1) I heard that this book had The Raven Boys vibes and I was sooo excited to read this book and find out more as to why it resembled one of my favorites series of all time BUT......literally,FUCKING LIESSSSSS. I SEE NOTHING, N O T H I N G, ABOUT THIS BOOK THAT RESEMBLES MY FAVORITE BABIES OF ALL TIME. TO EVEN COMPARE THE TWO IS SACRILEGIOUS WTF. People say,"Oh, the writing!" NO."Oh, the atmosphere!"NO."Oh, the story!"HELL TO THE FUKCING NOPE.JUST NOPE. NOPE. NOPE. NOPE. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Holy fucking moly. 2) People are comparing this to a'darker' tale mashup of 'Alice in Wonderland' buuttt this book really reminded me of Night Film.. Why? Because literally there were so many parts of the book (last 2/3s) that vaguely did not make sense to me and even after rereading certain passages I just gave up. I just couldn't grasp the full of it.It was so confusing; sure the writing was good and the premise of the story overall is actually really intriguing and unique....but I just couldn't grasp the finality of certain passages of scenes in the book???Or maybe I'm just too stupid to understand lmao. 3) Alice, the main character.....my god so annoooyyyinnggg. She is an unlikable character made to be unlikable to be liked as a flawed character but I couldn't do it. She was so arrogant and selfish sometimes I just wanted to shout at her. Also the way she treated another person of color, a boy, was just plain ignorant and fucking stupid. They got stopped by a cop and he told her how he was uncomfortable around them and about his skin color and literally this white girl tells him to shut up and goes off about how he is super rich and has a ton of privilege....LIKE.....???? She was gonna run their car into a fucking tree because she got to pissed at this conversation and I was so fucking iritated I put the book down and drank a glass of water. Irrelevant but still.Alice, honey, grow the fuck up. Literally this book was one of my most anticipated releases of 2018 and so far, two of my most anticipated reads have been let downs and now I'm just flat out annoyed writing this stupid review and I was going to give this book three stars because it wasn't that bad but NOT and I'm going to be a petty ass bitch and give this fucking book two stars imsofuckingannoyedrightnowwhyisthishappeningughomgooooooddddddFUCK. skldmf ASDF BNKWEFHHSFDSJL J kjsfn kjadsfh2341284uO2 FUCJING CONFUSING AND DISASSSPOINTING STARSTwitter | Bookstagram | Youtube |
