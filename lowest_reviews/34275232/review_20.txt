This started off SO strong, but I feel like the first half and the second half were completely different books. Even though I’m not usually into fantasy, I would have easily given the first half 5 stars, but then the second half happened and I just 😐 ugh. What a let down. I will read more from this author in the future because I know she has potential to write a book I’ll love, but this one just was not it. Womp.
