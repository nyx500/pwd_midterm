this is the first book that has made me think that the author statements/praise on the back cover are completely made up. i mean, unless i have a defect copy, the fact that stephanie garber, karen mcmanus, seanan mcguire AND jennifer niven all adored this is highly suspicious, because this story is a hot mess.reading this (the plot specifically) reminded me of every time i have to untangle my headphones - it only becomes more and more of a mess until i get so frustrated and i throw them across the room. i thought that if i continued reading, the plot would become more clear and make sense, but instead it became more muddled and absurd. i also had issues with the lack of character development, inconsistent world building, and erratic pacing. overall, this is just a really poor execution of an unique, and what was a potentially interesting, story. such a shame. â†  2.5 stars
