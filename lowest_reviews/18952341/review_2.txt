This remarkably perfect fantasy book is going down as my second favorite book of all time. Simply incredible.Words cannot describe how wonderful this book is, but I will try my best.I went into this book was a healthy dose of skepticism. For whatever reason, whenever a book gets enormous praise from the book reviewing community, and has a litany of huge awards heaped upon it, I end up disappointed. But this is the first time that I actually think the praise upon it has been downplayed. This book is what happens if you take all the political machinations from the five book from "A Song of Ice and Fire", multiple that by about 5, and then package it into one single book. This is not an exaggeration for dramatic effect, this book has twists, turns, and backstabbings, seemingly every other page. It's breathtaking in how quickly the pace turns on it's heels in this book and leaves the reader immensely hungry to read the next page, because the action doesn't let up.This book does come off a little on the "dry" side due to this, it's not filled with huge long conversations between characters to really get to find out the heart of what makes each person who they are, but instead focuses heavy on plot. That's not to say the characters are weak, but the plot here is really where this book shines.Everything about this book is simply perfect, and I absolutely cannot wait to keep reading this wonderful, wonderful series to find out what happens next.Check out my YouTube channel where I show my instant reactions upon finishing reading fantasy books.
