(4.5) If you’re looking for a book to keep you awake at night because you NEED to finish it then this is it!Somebody’s going to be murdered at the ball tonight. It won’t appear to be a murder so the murderer won’t be caught. Rectify that injustice and I’ll show you the way out.I loved how unique the premise was, a murder-mystery where the main character gets to relive the same day 8 times to try and solve it but every day he's in a different body. It was also interesting to see how the different bodies/personalities affected the story and there were twists I didn’t see coming. I was feeling a reading slump creeping in and this book fixed it so I’m rounding it up to 5 stars.Would recommend if you’re in the mood for a mystery with a sci-fi twist to it!
