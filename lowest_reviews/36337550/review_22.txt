Get ready for the most unusual, overwhelmingly impressive journey through this puzzle land of  "Murder at the Masquerade Ball". You won't need a ticket to get in, just get a copy of the book (the hard copy so you can enjoy the map of Blackheath, a cozy and quiet place to read (you won't want any distractions), time to ponder all the twists that are going to keep your brain busy!!I loved it, but needed to pace myself and take my time to enjoy all the twisty turns that the narrator, Aiden Bishop, threw at me during his attempts to stop a murder that has already taken place!So many times while reading this one, I would have to just pause and smile at the action that was taking place because I was just so amused!!It was so atmospheric and the different players were all very intriguing and kept popping up throughout the story.  Some favorites were the footman, Anna, Evelyn, and the Plague Doctor!I enjoyed my time at Blackheath House and this totally unique reading experience.  I would recommend if you enjoy complex layered mysteries with a large cast of witty characters. It is a book that had me pausing, thinking, and re-reading passages (all the while with a smile :0)I borrowed this book from my library, listened on Hoopla (some chapters), and ended up buying the kindle version half-way through.
