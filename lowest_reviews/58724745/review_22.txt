A secret species of people, who may or may not be of alien lineage, live amongst us in relative peace and isolation in grand old castles. They look like humans, they talk like humans, but they are not human. Most of their kind are born with book teeth and eat our literature for sustanance, absorbing the words as knowledge. Others are born with probiscus tongues and are referred to as "mind eaters" or dragons. They feed on human essence and absorb their victims memories and personalities. Female book eaters are becoming rarer as the Families continue to arrange marriages between themselves in an effort to keep their kind from going extinct. Mind eater children are sent off with the Knights to be trained as guard dogs, for lack of a better term. Except Devon is not having it. Having been sent off to her second marriage, and having given birth to her second child, a beautiful mind eater boy, Devon refuses to give up her son and becomes hell bent on escaping from that way of life. You would think a book about a humanoid species that eats books and absorbs its content as knowledge would be right up my alley. Yeaaaahh, apparently not so much. As much as I wanted to like it, I could tell within the first 25 pages or so that it was going to be a struggle. I ended up talking myself out of DNFing it a few times, and I'm mostly ok with the fact that I didn't. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible. It was just a little too fantasy-ish for me. While it wasn't my cup of tea, you may certainly fall in love with it, if for no other reason than it being an interesting exploration of motherhood, family dynamics, and queer identity.
