I hate that I'm leaving a bad review on this book. I'd been excited for it since I heard it existed! The premise sounds absolutely fascinating, almost immediately mythical. It's the sort of plot that you can't believe hasn't been done a million times before. Book eaters gaining knowledge through eating books! It's a good hook, for sure.Sadly that was where it lost me. The premise is as great as I hoped it would be, but the story it's stuck with is generic fantasy. There are different factions, they hate each other, it's all very archaic and medieval, etc etc etc. After the 10% mark the book might as well have been about vampires or ghouls or Insert Generic Monster Here. It's not bad, the writing shows promise, and I feel like the author has a lot of potential, but for this specific book the experience was disappointing. Also I hope her next book has a different narrator. This one was just awful. She reads absolutely everything at the same clip, with the same inflection. Dialogue sounds the same as scene description which sounds like the quotes that open each chapter. She's always at a seven in terms of intensity, which is either way too much or not enough depending on what's happening. The end result is that it mixes the story into a dull hum of white noise. Also "coup" is not pronounced "coop." I actually looked it up because hey, maybe it's a British thing, but no. She says "coop," and she says it a LOT.Thanks to Netgalley for saving me from wasting an Audible credit on this one.
