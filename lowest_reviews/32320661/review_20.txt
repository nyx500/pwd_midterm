WHY EVERLESS MADE ME WANT TO RUN AT IT WITH A PITCHFORK1. Cardboard cut-out charactersJules, the heroine, is another Special Snowflake who was blind to any sort of practical reasoning, and decides to disregard everyone's advice because she thinks she knows what's best. The side-characters aren't developed AT ALL and basically have zero personality. We're always told about their characteristics, but never really shown these. *coughs* *coughs some more*2. Typical storylinesSure, we're given something different with the whole blood and time being used as money thing, but the flow of the story and the individual scenes gave me a sense of deja vu, which basically means that I've probably read something similar in the past.3. A WTF-romance-love-triangle thingSee, I don't even know what to call it. In reality, we have this one dude who the heroine's been crushing on for ages, who is an absolute sweetheart (or so we're CONSTANTLY reminded throughout the book). Then, there are these creepy/weird hints of a possible love triangle with this dude's "mean" older brother. Pssh.4. Bland/boring writingI found it SO HARD to get into this book. The writing felt flat, since there was a LOT more telling than there was actual showing.5. Weird twistsThere was basically one "big" twist in the book, and it honestly felt like it came out of nowhere--it felt a bit forced, like there was no other possible solution to the problem/way to explain all the conflicts going on, so it came off as though any-way-is-better-than-no-way. ***Find more book reviews and bookish lists:YA Book Blog | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest | Email
