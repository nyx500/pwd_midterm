3.5/5This was such a unique story! Seriously. The whole idea of being able to "drink time" to live longer was something I've never read about before. So yay for originality. However, the biggest downside was how the story started slowly; however, luckily, it picked up towards the middle and end.Since this is Sara Holland's debut novel, I'm quite impressed with her originality. Normally, all YA fantasy novels have similar qualities (an obvious romance, similar plot, characters, etc.). Not with this one, though! At least, not all of it was similar to other YA fantasy novels. Honestly, I think I'm more impressed by the originality of the story than anything else. I thought the characters were fine - I mean, Jules didn't seem original, but she wasn't annoying either. I didn't care for Roan too much though, which took a lot away from the story (to me) since he was supposed to be the main "romantic interest." On the other hand, his brother, Liam, is probably my favorite character; mainly because I did not see that change of character coming. When we are introduced to Liam in chapter one I thought, "Oh, here's the character I'm going to hate." Only, by the end, I ended up liking him the most. So, good job there Sara Holland. I truly didn't see that one coming.Overall, I felt like so much more could've been done with the idea, but what was done with it was fine (besides, there is another book on the way!). Therefore, Everless was good but not great, because I felt like something was lacking throughout. Regardless, it certainly kept me entertained.Can't wait to see what happens in book 2! I've only got a year to wait...
