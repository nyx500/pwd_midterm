This wound up being a really interesting fantasy adventure that touched on a lot of tropes but did it in a fun way. Jules has grown up in a poor village, daughter of the blacksmith, where your blood can be sold to give years of your life to someone else. The rich steal life from the poor, and when her father cannot pay the taxes on their house, Jules goes off to the castle to work as a servant to try to earn more “years” and save him. The twists and turns kept coming. There were several interesting love potentials and some nice friendships as well. Pacing was nice with lots of cliffhangers and must-turn-the-page moments. I will definitely be checking out the sequel!Please excuse typos/name misspellings. Entered on screen reader.
