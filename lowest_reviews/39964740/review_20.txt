3.5 Stars - This was a hard decision but I am not convinced we needed the horrific descriptions of the painful memories as it was essentially a romance. For me it would have been enough to hint at the horror and then move on.CW: There are some significant triggers in this book with some particularly distressing content.description of rape, rape of minor, sexual violence, homophobia, animal abuse/killing, traumatic scene where man is taunting a girl by detailing about how he had been sexually assaulting her and how she had cried etc (her memory had been repeatedly erased after periods of sexual abuse so he could start the cycle of abuse again), suicide, consensual sex.Well I thought the memory book binding was an interestingly dark concept.It is however, important to mention that this is absolutely a romance, with very little time spent on any other elements in this intriguing world. Luckily I had read some informative reviews so it came as no surprise to me. And what a well written, swoon-worthy romance it was! My favourite section was actually from Lucian's POV in the last part. My poor heart was willing love to triumph over adversity. In and amongst this however, is some deeply disturbing content. It was actually quite jarring. Some of the memories people had erased from their minds and bound in books made for difficult reading. I would advise checking out the content warnings. Dark parts aside, and as contradictory as it sounds, this was mostly a lovely romance book!
