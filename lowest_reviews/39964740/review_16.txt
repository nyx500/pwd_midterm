Set in the Victorian age with a dusting of fantasy, The Binding is a gritty, realistic love story. It was surprising in many ways and I would caution the reader not to read the flyleaf. It is broken into three parts, each very different, the first two are from the point of view of Emmett, a farmer's son, the last is in Lucian's mind, a rich aristocrat with a brute for a father. Everything about the setting is the same as Victorian England, except for the subject of books. Books are taboo in this culture, because of the process called binding, in which a person can divest themselves of a horrific memory by placing it in the mind of a binder who writes it into your book. Your book becomes the sacrosanct property of the binder, never to be divulged, or that is what is supposed to happen. Unfortunately, this is not always the case and unscrupulous binders sell people's books or let criminals repeat their crimes, by erasing the memories of the victim.I believe a second book would be lovely. I would like to have the story of Seredith and her son told. Why is such an honorable mentor and teacher cursed with such a terrible child? I would give this a 3.5 if possible, because although the beginning is slow, I loved the second part and the happy ending, but was not entranced so much by the constant mentions of having to piss. Some things are better left unsaid.
