This was a magical and incredibly well written novel. Emmett is sent away by his parents to work as a Binder’s apprentice. If people want certain bad memories to be taken away they can visit a Binder and be ‘bound’. The resulting book is then kept safe so that the person will never have to relive the memories again. But there are certain Binders who sell books, who treat the trade or its patients with zero respect. When Emmett sees a book with his name on, he wonders what secrets it holds. But the only way to unbind a person is to burn their book if you begin to tell someone their secret it can cause awful pain. I loved the characters, the writing is gorgeous and it is a wonderful premise. The only reason it missed 5 stars for me is because the premise didn’t feel brand new to me. I’ve read  more happy than not  and there are so many similar themes. Don’t get me wrong I really enjoyed both but for 5 stars a book really has to move and or shock me and this one just missed that. I also wish there was a bit more background on some things. Like  why wasn’t Emmett’s sister bound? And what is the binders fever that Emmett suffered from?  I really enjoyed this and would recommend to fans of magical realism.
