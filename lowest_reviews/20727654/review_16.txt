5 "exactly what I needed right now" stars.The Paper Magician turned out to be a quick and delightful read. Set in 1901 London, it gave me a distinct magic-y feeling I love so much. The atmosphere reminded me of Howl's Moving Castle somehow.It can easily be read as a standalone - the ending is well-rounded in a way that allows but does not require a sequel. Even though the MCs are 19 and 30 years old, the book itself and the world depicted in it are a little naive, as if the book is meant for younger audiences. It certainly didn't feel like any of the YA books I've ever read.I liked both of the main characters: Ceony - a practical, no-nonsense sort, and Emery - a kind, intelligent and all-around good guy. “But how will I know if he’s acting strange?” Ceony asked. “He’s strange already.”In the beginning it surprised me a little that the school board would ship a 19-y.o. girl to become an apprentice and live with a 30-y.o. man, just the two of them in the same house. Isn't that, like, a little creepy? But it wasn't. So now I'm off to the next one. Hopefully it will be just as enchanting.
