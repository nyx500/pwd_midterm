3.5 StarsFor unknown reasons, I really like a detailed story about magic and learning all about it, and this delivered for the most part.Our heroine Ceony has had her heart set on being an expert in metal manipulation, but because there’s a shortage of paper magicians, she’s technically forced to apprentice as a Folder. To say she’s not happy about this is an understatement. However, Ceony really has no choice - either become a Folder or she can never legally practice magic.This really captured my interest right away. I loved learning along with Ceony, and I was intrigued by the enigmatic Emery Thane who’s her teacher. How Ceony gradually became more and more engaged in her craft held me rapt right up until the main conflict happened. Emery’s heart is literally cut right out of his chest by a sect of evil practitioners known as Excisioners who use blood magic, and despite Ceony’s blatant inexperience, she’s determined to save her mentor before time runs out.This would have been great had it not veered into some existential mumbo jumbo, literally and figuratively delving into Emery’s heart to find insight and help. This is where the story lost me as I typically like a very straightforward quest where it seems wholly hopeless for the ultimate underdog. However, the fight at the end was good enough, and there were a few twisty developments and reveals to keep this reader on her toes.It doesn’t hurt that there’s an age gap romance brewing in a historical background, and because I really enjoyed the magical set up here, I’m going to check out the sequel for Ceony’s further education and next adventure!
