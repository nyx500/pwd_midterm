Spoiler-free video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoTOX...Written review (also spoiler-free):Ishiguro’s new novel was my most anticipated release of this year, so I was unbelievably excited when a review copy came in from the Allen & Unwin representative. Thank goodness this lived up to (and even exceeded) my expectations. Set in 6th Century Britain, it follows an elderly couple who set out from their village to find their son. I knew nothing about this going into it, so it took me a little while to place it in the fantasy genre. However, this is fantasy in the same way that Never Let Me Go is science-fiction, so the emphasis is on the characters’ relationships and their inner lives. The fantasy elements are there to create a framework for the themes of memory and love that motivate the characters. There is a mist covering the land that causes people to forget elements of their past, so everyone is an unreliable narrator. A few typical Ishiguro traits can be found, such as the emphasis on memory and sparse but evocative description, but it is unlike anything he has written in the past. This is the kind of book that Tolkien might have written had he decided to focus on rich characterisation and relationships rather than the landscape. There are some treats for fans of British legend too, as this is set not long after the death of King Arthur.
