Is it better to remember? Or can we only live with ourselves and one another through ignorance?Kazuo Ishiguro writes a spellbinding fable of one elderly couple's quest for memory. Their journey takes us deep into a nostalgically rendered Dark Age. A post-Arthurian Britain inhabited by the myths and heroes of those isles, and a few more mythic traditions as well. Yet it is a fragile Britain where everything balances on the knife edge: social mores, the civilizational veneer, lifelong marital love, peace itself. Memory plays a double-role here. It holds everything together, pulling back from the edge, while also supplying that gentle, lethal nudge off the cliff. The memory of an infidelity. Of wartime barbarities. Of a lost son. Would we want to forget these things for the sake of contentment but while remaining aware of the veil that separates us from an authentic past? Shades of Orpheus.In Ishiguro's Edenic world, his characters desire a god-like knowledge of the past but at what personal cost? Will they survive? Or will they tip their world into the abyss?Also on Twitter and Tumblr.
