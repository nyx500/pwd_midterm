"Let no one stand in your way. If they face you, your beauty will entrap them. If they turn away, you will stab them in the back."Chalk up 'Snow White retelling from the POV of the wicked queen, set in imperial China' to the list of things I never knew I needed. Forest of a Thousand Lanterns is so vindictive and brilliant and and blade-edged in its message. "She touched her face. 'This is how a woman plays the game. It makes men weak and forget they make the rules. She becomes the player and they the pawns.'"Forest of a Thousand Lanterns chronicles Xifeng's rise, much like Heartless. She is yet the wicked queen, merely a peasant in a tiny village with stunning good looks and burning ambition. We see the steps she takes to secure a place at court, to fulfill the destiny her Guma (aunt) read for her in the cards—Empress of Feng Lu. In many ways, it's a story about the weaponization and currency of female beauty in a patriarchy. Women can't get anywhere based on talent, so they have to rely on their looks. Because of that there's quite a bit of girl-hating, but it never feels misogynistic. Xifeng often feels bad about disparaging her companions, but it's either them or her, and she's not exactly the type to share.“She knew her own worth. She would seize her destiny with all the strength and spirit within her, and bend them all to her will: every man kneeling and every woman overshadowed.” Two men are romantically interested in Xifeng, though I'd bank at calling it a love triangle. Xifeng isn't heavily emotionally invested in either—they're just tools for her on her quest. Shout-out to Wei for having a actual backbone. He refuses to stay by Xifeng's side like Generic YA Love Interest #2 while she pursues the emperor. All I can say is, if you're after a passionate earth-defying romance, look elsewhere. Shadow and Bone does a great job with the love vs. ambition plot. Xifeng's truest devotion is the crown.What can I say? I've always liked my heroines with a grey streak.
