this is a tricky one to rate because theres something about the story that makes it sooo boring, but quite interesting at the same time. its difficult to describe, but no matter how monotonous i thought this was, i still kept reading. many would describe this as a good thing, but i wanted the writing/story be better in the first place.most of the boredom came from the MC. she is extremely self-centred and only cares about her looks. i understand this is a retelling of the evil queen and vanity is very on brand for that character, but wow. it gets old having to constantly read about it. buuuut, i thought the prophecy and how the prophecy comes true for the MC was a lifeline her character very much needed. because the pacing is slow, i looked forward to each time the plan would slowly fall into place.overall, not a horrible book (there is some truly wonderful asian inspiration), but it definitely could have been better. not really a series i see myself continuing, however. â†  3.5 stars
