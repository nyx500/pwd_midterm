My very first buddy read with my favourite, the lovely   Lady Pim (aka Annie) of the Book Court Looking for a book that’s ridiculously relatable?? I found it.  “What do you do when your dreams are about to come true?” she asks. “No one ever tells you. They tell you to chase them, but what happens when you actually catch one?” So many of the books we read center around the  Chosen-One™, the Special-Snowflake™, the Saviour-of-the-World™,  but this book is just about the everyday kids (basically and me you) who usually get overlooked.  The Rest of us Just Live Here  is narrated by Mikey, a regular senior who is about to graduate with his sister and his best friends, Jared and Henna. With their impending (very frightening but very normal) future becoming a reality, the group is trying to live out their final week together.But while Mikey stresses over asking out his long-time-crush Henna out, an End-of-the-World sort of event is taking place (hence the crazy blue lights). I really enjoyed reading this book for the reason that it was very relatable. While Mikey doesn’t have the burden of saving the world, he is fighting other battles like his un-perfect family and his OCD. But Patrick Ness doesn’t leave us clueless as to what the real heroes have to encounter. With each chapter, we get a brief summary of what the  Indie Kids  are doing and what’s happening in the world of the  Chosen Ones.  And I must say, I mightily enjoyed that. I particularly liked how the plot was centered around the theme of friendship and love and family. Cheesy as it sounds, it was very heartfelt and inspiring. A very pleasant and easy read (with a lovely touch of hilarity). “Not everyone has to be the Chosen One. Not everyone has to be the guy who saves the world. Most people just have to live their lives the best they can…” 3.5 stars!!!
