Honestly, I don't know what to exactly rate this because I was thoroughly enjoying it up until the end. The ending was a letdown, to say the least. It was so anticlimactic, even. If it was meant to be a surprise as to who done it, it wasn't. Not even the slightest. The reasoning behind the unexpected event(s), ever so slightly. Some of the red herrings worked but only for a little while. The further you read on, the more obvious everything becomes. Even before the main character can figure it out. Unsure if that was intended by the author but either way that ending was a disappointment indeed.... I'll go with 3.5ðŸŒŸ... and not rounded up.
