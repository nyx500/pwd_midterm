As a fic writer/reader, a lover of tropes, and a lover in particular of those inherent in Beauty and the Beast, I get why Robin McKinley would have wanted to retell this same story more than once. Heck, I was happy to read it again within months of reading McKinley's first retelling, Beauty -- and boy am I glad I read that one first, because if I'd started with Rose Daughter, I doubt I would have gone back for more. Rose Daughter is duller and far less romantic; for this version, McKinley seemed to decide that the most interesting thing about the Beauty and the Beast story is its implications for horticulture. Which, no.Basically, she got it right the first time. Read Beauty, skip this.
