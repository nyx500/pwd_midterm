Very nice and vivid. Slower and quieter than the author’s other take on the Beauty and the Beast tale, but probably with many more protagonists of the non-speaking variety. I loved the descriptions and Beauty’s unassuming, no-nonsense strength.It was a curious thing, she thought sadly, how one is no longer satisfied with what one was or had if one has discovered something better. She could not now happily live without roses, although she had never seen a rose before three years ago.
