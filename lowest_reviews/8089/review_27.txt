This book was painful. I really thought I was gonna get a book with character development, depth, and different than the previous book.Oh boy. Did I get something different. At times it was confusing but that ending, that ending was the most confusing of all. I sort of mad-rushed/skimmed through the other half of the book because the character development became boring, plodding, empty words just to fill pages.But that ending. I don't think my eyes can unsee what went on there.
