what a mess. a slow, painful, overly descriptive mess. it took me F.O.R.E.V.E.R to get into it and then once i did, i found the story only remotely interesting. AND even that was like pulling teeth to get through.-why does she fall in love with him? because of 6 or 7 encounters and conversations?-what's with all the animals? and the cat that gave birth on her bed while she was sleeping? gross. burn those sheets.-i know there had to be some allusions and whatever with all her descriptions of the house and the unicorn and whatever but i just didn't care to plod through them. NOTHING was clear. not even a few gimmes for those of us that need some obvious direction.-the story dump in the last 50 pages. all the details that the old lady reveals to beauty's mind would have been REALLY helpful dispersed throughout the story. -the dream/vision/whatever when beauty is climbing on the roof? what in the world was going on?-why does she LEAVE the beast when she needs answers? and go to her sisters who don't know anything? why didn't she just ask him when he said that he would tell her. and the curse that wasn't a curse. BLAH! this is making me angry.-and the magic. apparently it you just call it all magic, that takes care of everything. don't read it. just enjoy her other telling of beauty and the beast, beauty: a retelling of the story of beauty and the beast.
