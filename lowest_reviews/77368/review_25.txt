I can't believe I've not read this since I started using Goodreads!I love this book, it's such a beautiful, gentle story, McKinley at her best. The plot is obviously based around the Sleeping Beauty fairy story, but really, it only starts like it (fairy curses princess to prick her finger on a spindle and die on her 21st birthday). McKinley writes a tale of a no-nonsense girl, Rosie who grows up in a small village, the guardian of two fairies, not knowing that she is the princess. She is the least "princess-like" princess you could possibly imagine, and I love the book because of this. Instead, she spends all her time hanging round the smithy, learning to doctor horses after a childhood where she's grubby a lot of the time with a penchant for falling into bogs! It's a book full of well realised female characters who are full of agency and who ensure that the destiny that Rosie is supposed to follow is not met.Reading this book is like getting a warm hug and I always regret finishing it because it's so utterly lovely.
