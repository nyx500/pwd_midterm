I have no idea how to review this book. I started out enthralled with it and Robin McKinley’s beautiful writing. My progress got slower and slower till I finally stopped at chapter 21, nearly at the end. I feel awful not finishing it but it just lost allll interest in this book. I feel like it’s at a more rambling, sleepy pace than it was at the beginning and the characters it focuses on now are much less interesting (to me) than the ones at the beginning. #Did not finish because I’m too busy right now to be reading books I don’t absolutely love.
