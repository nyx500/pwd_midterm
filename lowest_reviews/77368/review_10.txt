A fun, greatly expanded retelling of Sleeping Beauty, with Briar Rose going against stereotype by being a strapping young woman with a love for animals and the outdoors, and no regard for her beautiful blonde hair. I really enjoyed the story until the confrontation with the evil fairy Pernicia. Then Robin pulls her familiar trick of a foggy vague battle and some unexplained magic to get us through to the end. Bad Robin! Oh, well, most readers will forgive her. I, though, choose to dock her a star off my rating for it, and to continue to maintain that The Blue Sword and Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast are Robin's best books.
