THIS WAS A MISS FOR MEI don't know what it was with this one, because I should have loved it. Greek mythology is right up my alley, I've loved it since I was a child. My name comes from Greek mythology for crying out loud! But somehow, this was still a miss. Perhaps I wasn't in the right frame of mind? Others sure seem to like it, anyway - I'm just not one of them 🤷‍♀️"I was born knowing to do three things - how to breathe, how to dream, and how to love you."- Castor👍 What I Liked 👍Premise: The Greek gods cast out of Olympus to fight for their lives against the descendants of the legendary Greek heroes. It had a kind of Hunger Games feeling with a Greek mythology twist, that was compelling.👎 What I Disliked 👎Exposition: The execution of this book could have been better. The world was rich and complex, that's for sure, but it needed more exposition. The information came in clumps here and there, making it feel like you were continually behind on everything. I felt like I had to catch up all the time or that I was missing something. It was a bit frustrating.Frantic: There were so many highs in this book. So much action, so much happening again and again. Action is great, but there needs to be 'downtime' too. This didn't have much downtime, making it feel frantic."Mystery": There is a central mystery to this book that didn't feel like a mystery to me at all, because I had it figured out from the beginning. It only took one sentence (of course I won't say which) in one of the first chapters to lay the whole thing bare for me. Ending: The ending felt strange, as if something had been left out.  This was partly because Lore fainted right at the height of the action, which is a reading pet peeve of mine. I feel like we as readers missed the entire ending because Lore did too. It made the ending both confusing and unsatisfying.Follow me for more book loving content!Blog ✨ Facebook ✨ Instagram ✨ Twitter Blog Post: 15 Books to Read if You Love Jane Austen
