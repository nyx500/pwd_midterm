TW//  violence, gore, puking, sexual assault, attempted rape, misogyny, ableism, failing cancer treatment, murder (including murders of innocent people and children) I was nervous about reading this book because of all the mixed reviews that I’ve seen of it, but it ended up exceeding my expectations. Lore is an epic story filled with Greek mythology, squad goals, and plot twists that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole story. The story weaves the complex architecture of New York City with both popular and lesser known Greek myths to create an interesting, fast paced book.I’ve seen a lot of people compare this book to Percy Jackson and some even go so far as to say it��s a “Percy Jackson rip off” but that’s wrong on so many levels. I would say this book is closer to an intense version of The Hunger Games or the Mortal Kombat movies, but this book is so unique that those comparisons don’t seem to capture what this book is truly about. This book is perfect for Greek mythology fans and action fans, but the content matter definitely makes it more suitable for adults or older teens who can handle really intense subject matters. If you struggle with some triggering content, check the trigger warnings for this book because it deals with some very triggering things. All of them are handled well, but some scenes were challenging to get through because of their content matter.The characters were a major reason why I loved this book. Castor, Van, Miles, and Lore made a super fun group that was ultimate squad goals. Their blend of personalities made for an awesome team up. Some of the characters don’t appear super likable at first, but as you learn about the characters’ past trauma and how they’ve been coping with that trauma, you’ll gain a deeper appreciation for the characters. The romance in this book wasn’t super intense, but the romance between a couple of the side characters was beautiful. It was something that I wasn’t expecting, but it was slowly woven in to the story and it helped create some happy moments in the midst of all the violence and chaos.My only issue with this book was the ending. I considered dropping my rating down to four stars because I was so disappointed by the ending, but it was only really the last 3% of the book (or 16 pages) that was bad so I think I’m going to stick with five stars for right now. One of the villains just suddenly acted out of character to save one of the good characters, which was incredibly frustrating to me, and after the villain did that, the remaining pages became extremely cheesy. There was also quite a few loose ends left at the end of the story. I wish this story would’ve been slightly longer so that the ending could’ve been more satisfying, but it was really only 3% of a 480 page book that disappointed me so it could’ve been a lot worse.Overall I found this book to be a phenomenal read that I will always cherish. I cried while reading this book and I also smiled from pure happiness. I’m planning on reading more books by Alexandra Bracken soon and I hope Lore gets a spin-off novel at some point in the future.I also filmed a reading vlog for this book, so I’ll update my review with the link to that vlog once it’s published onto my YouTube channel.
