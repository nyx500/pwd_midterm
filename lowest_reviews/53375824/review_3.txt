its been awhile since ive read a book that is inspired by greek mythology, so i already knew i would enjoy this. adding that story gave me a very mature percy jackson meets hunger games vibe, this was a lot more fun that i had anticipated. i actually think readers will be surprised by just how brutal this story actually is. i mean, greek gods are violent beings, and this story definitely leans into that side of them. i think it made the concept of the agon that much more desperate and dangerous. it gave me anxiety, but in a good way.however, i do think the story could have benefited from dual POVs. castors arc and development is too important to the story for him to just be a side character. i think if he had his own chapters, the world-building might have flowed a bit smoother and not have felt like it was crammed into confusing info dumps via lore. but overall, this story is an exciting adventure and showcases a very unique side to greek mythology. â†  4 stars
