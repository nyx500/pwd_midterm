Not quite 3.5 stars. I didn’t know what to expect going into this book. I knew it was the first of a long series and the ratings/reviews had me wondering. The pace of the book is pretty slow. It involves a lot of daily life type of descriptions. I thought that this would make me lose interest. There were times that I felt this everyday life events could have been shorted to move the book along, but overall I came to enjoy it. It felt comfortable to me and relaxing, which I wasn’t expecting. The book did have exciting parts also. I enjoyed the character development and felt that I got to know them well. The magic system was interesting and refreshing from a lot of other fantasy novels. I enjoyed the writing style of the author. The book flowed well and was easy to read. I will continue in the future with this series to see how it evolves.
