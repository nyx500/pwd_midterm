You will fall in love with one of the characters in this book. I absolutely guarantee it. The only question is, with whom? Will it be with the flamboyant Ammar ibn Khailan, poet, spymaster, kingslayer, warrior? With Jehane, strong and stubborn doctor? Perhaps with Miranda, so beautiful and queenly even when managing a horse ranch? Or with proud Rodrigo, the Scourge of Al-Rassan, brave, virtuous, faithful?Or will it be with one of the minor characters? Starstruck Alvar, alluring Zabira, the wise Ishak or his loving wife? Perhaps you'll be won over by Lain an his cheerful blasphemies, the twins Diego with his strange gift and Fernan with his filial devotion, or by Queen Ines' and her domineering passions?I had never read anything by Guy Gavriel Kay, only knew him as the hand behind "The Silmarillion". He is a master storyteller, a world-weaver like few others, and his skillful pen draws for us characters we would love to share a meal, a bed, a life, a world with.In the end, this book is a sad one, an evocation of how when the world turns, some rise up while others must be ground down. Al-Rassan renews itself, leaving behind its old skin, and in doing so, reveals that it is much too small for four people of such heroic proportions. The people you fall in love with die in this book, and it's not suprising.... what is is that it is so very hard to let go.I will return to al-Rassan one day, no doubt about it. Do yourself a favor and read this book NOW.
