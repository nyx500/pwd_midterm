I love this book. 5 Stars. All the Stars.It’s a slow burn. I can easily acknowledge that, but the characters are intriguing from the start and Kay’s writing is just beautiful. The world can be a bit confusing as well if you don’t understand the background of medieval Spain as a lot of names and history are thrown at you from the start. There’s also three different religions and the strife between them is the center stage of the book; the Kindath are Jews, the Jaddites are Christians, and the Asharites are Muslims. The religions are pretty loosely based, but I think knowing that connection makes the book much easier to place.Oh but this book. It might be a slow burn, but before you know it, you can’t put it down and then tears are streaming down your face but you still can’t stop. I love it. I love Kay’s writing. I love the emotional gut punches and the beautiful impactful scenes. I love how many times I’ll reread a passage because it’s so on point. I love the little touches of metaphor sprinkled throughout, and how I’m still not sure I’ve caught them all.I could try to write a serious review, but I think Alissa's review is pretty perfect.I recommend this book to everyone. Go slow. Enjoy it. Soon you won’t be able to stop.
