This novel gained power and complexity as I made my way deeper into its pages, and in the end I came to greatly appreciate its rich subtleties, its many-layered characters, and its fascinating world. I was more emotionally captivated by, and more propelled to burn through, Kay’s incredible Tigana, but I’m very glad to have read more of Kay’s work, and I will certainly continue to do so.
