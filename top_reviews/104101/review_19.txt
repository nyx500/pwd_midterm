Sadly, this book did not capture me at all. I appreciated the craft of it, but was not pulled in. I discovered at about the 400-page point that I was reading this just to say that I read it. That is not a good sign.I'm quite upset, considering I adored A Brightness Long Ago and really thought I would love this as well. I did not.This could be because I just wasn't in the right frame of mind. who knows. Sometimes I'm just not in the mood for a certain kind of book. But I genuinely just think this one was not my cup of tea. I really expected to be enthralled, as there is an awesome amount of Islamic and seemingly Spanish (though I could be mistaken) influence in here, and I was specifically looking for that kind of story. It's certainly not a bad book, but not what I'm looking for at this moment. This is my own taste speaking. Since it will permanently sit upon one of my many shelves, one day I may take it down and read it again. I could end up loving it years from now. I can be strange that way.Reread update: Well . . . turns out I WAS just in the wrong frame of mind. I was in a bad place mentally when I read this the first time. I'm actually embarrassed that I gave it only two stars in my original review. This book is brilliant. I figured something was off, because of how much I admire Guy Gavriel Kay. I thought to myself "There's no way I actually disliked that book. There's just no way!". I was right. I IMPLORE you to disregard my first review completely. Upon a full reread, I can say this is a fantastic work of fiction. I hate myself for not being able to get into it the first time. Let this be a lesson to you, folks: sometimes a book deserves a second chance. Sometimes you might've just been in a bad mood.
