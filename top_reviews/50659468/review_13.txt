reread in 2022 i've typed and deleted this review for the past ten minutes. it's hard to review this book in a way that doesn't give too much credit to sarah j maas because i cannot emphasize enough how deeply troubled i am by her massive fame despite her problematic stances. all i can say is that i'm troubled by how much i enjoyed it. --Probably one of the most game-changing books I have ever read. My love for Rhysand might be usurp my love for Warner.update january 2018: nevermind lol
