UPDATE: $3.99 on Kindle US today 2/27/22Omg! Artstation - Sara Mirza - captured Gabriel’s hotness 😏I’ve been back and forth with this book. My feelings may change as I’m trying to sort myself out. I will say the narrator did an amazing job on the audio. The book is really sad and of course dark. I'm not sure about keeping books like this anymore as life is doom and gloom enough. I enjoyed most of the book accept a few parts. I’m interested to see where this trilogy will go. I want to know if it’s going to be a total disappointment like some others that I kicked to the curb! I can’t even imagine what will be in two more books 😬 ……….. The art in the book is awesome! I wish all books had art throughout! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
