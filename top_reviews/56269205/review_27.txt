"And in sight of God and his Seven Martyrs, I do here vow; Let the dark know my name and despair. So long as it burns, I am the flame. So long as it bleeds, I am the blade. So long as it sins, I am the saint. And I am silver."

NOT SUITABLE FOR YOUNGER READERS!⚠️Well, I did it, guys. I finally finished it. It took me more than a week, I reached the point where I wanted to scream into my pillow from how long it was taking me to get to the end and from all the heartbreaking, bittersweet moments that ruined me. I need to know what happens next. NOW!!I honestly did not have a lot of expectations for this one. For me, the jury's still out on Jay Kristoff. I was NOT really impressed with Nevernight to the point where I didn't continue the series and am still debating if I should give it another try, but The Aurora Cycle series was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. It blew my damn mind. I'm glad I gave Empire of the Vampire a shot, though. Aside from it taking me more than a week to finish because, despite the incredible story of Gabriel de Leon, the story really dragged on and on. There were times when I just couldn't focus, couldn't read anymore and that was really frustrating.That, however, did little to stop me from completely losing my mind over the magnificence that was the storyline, the characters, and THE BEST VAMPIRE LORE I'VE READ FOR A VERY LONG TIME. Just...🤯🤯🤯 The ending only left me with more questions that need to be answered. Just thinking about it makes me what to scream again. Also while the writing style might have felt longer than it was, I still liked the descriptions, dialogue, revelations, and the smooth way the story switched from one timeline to another. Not to mention, the ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE ILLUSTRATIONS accompanying this awesome story. OH. MY. GOD. 😍😍😍 I think ALL authors should add illustrations like those in their novels. I really shouldn't expect anything less, though, given how breathtaking the covers were, both the UK and US editions.Gabriel de Leon was a masterpiece. He should refine his storytelling skills a little bit 😝😝 but other than that...*chef's kiss*. He is a half-human, half-vampire member of a holy warrior order, the Silversaints, and his powers include a heightened sense of smell and hearing, super-strength, fast healing, and unwittingly cockblocking gay youths right when they're about to get it on. 😂😂 I think it's safe to say that Jay Kristoff is better off writing about 30-something year-old men, rather than 16-year-old girls. Am I right??There are plenty of other really well-written characters, but there are some that are my absolute favorite. Aaron de Coste, the hater-turned-friend, teen-drama Dior, Astrid the hater-turned-lover, and Ashdrinker the dysfunctional, talking blade. I DID NOT like Aaron de Coste in the beginning. He was a complete asshole to Gabriel for a long time. They became besties, though, and Aaron went from dipship to tolerable to one of my favorite characters. The same exact thing happened with Dior, the teen with the interesting secret Gabe reluctantly had to protect who became another of his dearest friends. As for Ashdrinker, she's a 'magicked' blade that can communicate with her wielder inside their head and since she's a little broken she only makes sense about half the time, which is what I loved most about her. She was a delight to read about, a badass weapon, and a pretty hilarious companion to Gabriel. I can't wait to read more about her. BUT no one else stood out for me more than Astrid Rennier. Astrid was a sisternovice living in the monastery Gabriel was taken to train as a silversaint. She was a sharp-tongued jerk that can't really help getting into trouble...and getting stoned. Also, she's a terrible influence on Gabe 😉😉 Their forbidden love for each other was so beautiful it left my eyes permanently heart-shaped now...😍😍 and my heart a bloody pulp...I really think this book is worth reading, but brace yourselves for a looong story
