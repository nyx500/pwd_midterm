Best Vampire book ever! Not only will I stake my heart on that, but it's left me positively dying to read the sequel!Final Rating: 4.5/5 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗To be honest, every other vampire book I've ever read has sucked. The whole genre just drives me batty, and I am yet to find a vampire character that I haven't found to be a giant pain in the neck. So despite glowing reviews from people who's views I respect, it was with a lot of trepidation that I delved into Jay Kristoff's "Empire of the Vampire." Lesson? Maybe I should go into more books with low expectations, as this book was flipping excellent! I found myself transported into a captivating, post-apocalyptic world, where vampire lore is hauntingly reimagined. The intricate journey of Gabriel de Leon, the last of the Silversaints, kept me hooked, making me grapple with themes of survival, faith, and power. It was a thrilling, immersive reading experience that breathed new life (risen from the crypt mayhaps?) into the vampire genre for me - or at least gave me an exception to the rule. Gabriel de LeonPlot Summary"Empire of the Vampire" is a riveting, multi-layered narrative set in a world plunged into eternal darkness by a vampire-led apocalypse. The protagonist, Gabriel de Leon, the last of the Silversaints, is compelled to recount his life's tale to Jean-Francois, a vampire historian. The narrative oscillates between Gabriel's teenage years, his life as a disgruntled addict in his thirties, and the 'present-day' narrative. As a young man, Gabriel grapples with familial relationships, the escalating threat of the vampire empire, his infatuation with blood, and his peculiar abilities that lead him to the Silversaint brotherhood. Years later, Gabriel, now a jaded and disgruntled addict, finds himself unwillingly entwined in a prophecy and part of an unconventional fellowship. In the present timeline, a war-weary Gabriel faces his captor, resulting in a compelling exchange of tales filled with forbidden love, dark menace, power struggles, and the complexity of faith. This saga is a testament to survival and resilience in a world dominated by terror and uncertainty, leaving readers eagerly anticipating the sequel.
“If we spend all our lives in darkness, is it any wonder when darkness starts to live in us?”
Plot: 5/5The plot is excellent! As mentioned, it's a dual-timeline narrative, with our main guy Gabriel recounting his life story in two distinct phases to a vampire historian, Jean-Francois. This back-and-forth timeline may sound jarring, but trust me, it works. It adds to the storytelling, giving us glimpses into Gabriel's past and present that weave together to form a complex, layered narrative.This story offers it all - forbidden love, a thrilling exploration of vampire lore, power struggles, and unexpected twists. It's a beautifully woven tapestry of plots, each one adding to the others. Sure, it's a long book with quite a few subplots - some of which may feel like they're not adding much - but overall, "Empire of the Vampire" is a daring, intricate masterpiece. It's like a bloody roller coaster that keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting anxiously to see what comes next.Throughout the book, we see a compelling exploration of Gabriel's faith. It's a raw, honest look at a man pushed to his limits, reflecting on past battles and sacrifices, powerful foes, and a love that's as alluring as it is forbidden. We witness the slow erosion of Gabriel's faith and, interestingly, the author uses this to delve into the complex nature of belief and how it can take different shapes for different people. And even though we know Gabriel must've survived to tell his tale, Kristoff still manages to keep the suspense high and the atmosphere heavy with anticipation.
““It is my empress's will to know the whole of your tale.'Gabriel reached into his battered britches, fished about under the monster's stare. Finally, he retrieved a tarnished royale from his pocket. 'Here.''What is that for?' Jean-François demanded.'I want you to take this coin to market, and buy me a fuck to give.””
Characterisation: 5/5If I had to pick one word to describe the characters in "Empire of the Vampire", it'd be 'real'. Kristoff has a knack for crafting characters that are as complex and flawed as they are captivating, and that definitely shines through in this book. Take Gabriel, the main guy - he's this mix of humor and bitterness, sarcasm, and world-weariness that just grabbed me. The exchanges between him and the vampire historian, complete with some solid banter and a healthy dose of "I don't give a damn" attitude, were a highlight for sure.It's not just Gabriel, though. The book's filled with intriguing characters, each bringing their own unique flavor to the story. You've got the likes of the rival Aaron de Coste, the master Greyhand, the mysterious Dior, and Holy Sister Astrid. Oh, and let's not forget about Gabriel's slightly unhinged talking blade, Ashdrinker. I mean, how cool is that? The antagonists, members of the Forever King's family, are pretty damn imposing and fascinating as well - a mix of beauty, agelessness, and downright terror. I think probably the best thing was the way the book shows you different stages of characters' lives. It's not easy to pull that off (and I've certainly read books where by showing you so much of a character it drags the story down into the realms of boredom), but Kristoff nails it. The character growth throughout the book, especially for Gabriel, is seriously impressive.
““What kind of hero are you?'Gabriel laughed, shaking his head.'Who the fuck told you I was a hero?””
Writing Style: 4/5A bit of a mixed bag for me here, but with more positives than negatives. One moment, I found myself grinning at some brilliant quote, the next, I was rolling my eyes at some of the more juvenile jokes. There's definitely a fair share of dirty humor in there, which wasn't always my cup of tea. Through it all though Kristoff's writing style is intense and vivid, the sort that drags you in and doesn't let go. And let me tell you this, when Kristoff hits the mark, he really hits the mark. His descriptions are the kind that make you feel like you're right there in the thick of it, right alongside the characters. There were moments when his writing got a bit melodramatic, but even then, I was still pretty hooked.There's a fair bit of swearing as well as some voyeuristic sexual content, so it's definitely not a book I'd hand over to a kid, but honestly? It works. The rough and raw language feels right for the story, and it never got old. And man, Kristoff knows how to write a dark, grim scene and still make it beautiful - that's some real talent right there. So yeah, despite some minor hiccups, Kristoff's writing is seriously impressive.
“Put a man in a room for a hundred years with a thousand books, and he’ll know a million truths. Put him in a room for a year with silence, and he’ll know himself.”
World Building: 4.5/5Even though vampires and humans at war might seem like a pretty basic setup, the world of here is anything but. Kristoff has this way of making everything feel so rich and real that you can't help but get sucked in. What really brings this world to life, though, are the descriptions. The dark ambiance, the vivid imagery of the cities and people - it all combines to create this immersive atmosphere. The map at the beginning of the book helps with that, too, giving you a solid sense of the layout of this world. And let's not forget the awesome black and white illustrations by Bon Orthwick sprinkled throughout the book. Honestly, for me it's the sort of world that keeps you thinking long after I've put the book down - I'm really looking forward to the next installment.My only problem when it comes to world building (and unfortunately it's a relatively big one in terms of personal preferences) is that I'm not typically a big fan of vampires in fantasy. They've never really been my thing. But even though the vampires here come with all the usual bells and whistles - you know, the typical powers and traits - Kristoff's writing goes a long way to saving the day for me. It's was so well done that it made even the most "vampire cliche" parts pretty good - although I'll admit I did skim a few of them.
“You're sailing awfully close to the shores of a little island most call None of Your Fucking Business.”
Enjoyment: 4/5 This book was a captivating experience that brilliantly revitalized vampire lore through its intricate narrative, profound characters, and Kristoff's exceptional writing. Despite minor hiccups like occasional juvenile humor, language that was slightly too melodramatic for my tastes and some traditional vampire cliches, the story triumphed through its engrossing depiction of Gabriel's layered journey of trials, power struggles, and faith. The vivid world-building, including the dark ambiance, vivid imagery, and Orthwick's striking illustrations, further enriched the narrative, making it an incredibly immersive experience. Though there were elements that didn't align with my personal preferences, the overall impact was an exhilarating read that left me eagerly anticipating the sequel. If you've read this far. I'm sorry (but also not sorry) for the puns earlier.Final Rating: 4.5/5 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌗
