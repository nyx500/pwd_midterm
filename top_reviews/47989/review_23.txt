Justice! Freedom! Reasonably Priced Love! And a Hard-Boiled Egg!This 29th Discworld novel has us go back to Ankh-Morpork again. Sam Vimes is about to be a father! But then, just when he thought that waiting for his wife to give birth was the most nerve-wrecking thing, timey-wimey stuff happens when he and The Watch are trying to apprehend a cop-killer on the memorial day of a revolution. So he ends up in the past, not least thanks to the intervention of The Library as well as Lu-Tze, and has to find his way home. Along the way, we get to se a wholly different side of the city and its citizens from a time when Vetinari was not Patrician (yes, it boggles the mind).This book, mainly, is about politics, about The People, about freedom and justice as concepts as well as the reality of them. But it is also very much about what makes Sam Vimes be who he is. It was a deep character study as well as a look at history and its repetition.Moreover, in addition to some of Pratchett's best writing including the well-known gems such as puns and turns of phrases, it was a mad dash. Theoretically, we all know more or less what happens to Vimes since we know there will be other The Watch books, but I was still fearing for him, sitting on the edge of my seat. And I wanted him to go give Carcer the justice that little shit deserved - preferrably without abandoning his principles. Not to mention that in this one case I actually wanted history to repeat itself since I knew where it would lead to. You see, I actually like Vetinari, his leadership style and what has become of Ankh-Morpork. Did it? Well, I shan't spoiler it for those of you who haven't read this madcap adventure yet.I might be wearing a Lilac every 25th May (in addition to my towel) from now on. And now excuse me while I go and eat my hard-boiled egg.
