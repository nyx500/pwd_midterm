I just loved it! It's a parody of every day life as we live and breathe it. Favorite quotes: "The garden didn't get much proper light. Gardens like this never did. You got second-hand light once the richer folk in the taller buildings had finished with it," [...] "But it'd take magic beans to reach real sunlight in gardens like this," and, "Push off and get us two cups of tea lad will you! One green with yak butter and Mr. Vimes will have it boiled orange in a builder's boat with two sugars and yesterday's milk." This is a reference to what we call Builder's tea in England, a strong brew of black tea, usually made by leaving the teabags in the teapot to stew for a long time. I grew up in England, and we made tea for everyone who came to call, whether they were the plumber, or selling insurance, or making a delivery, they all got a cup of hot black tea with milk. Indeed, tea was drunk on every occasion, and my instinct on hearing bad news to this day, is first to make a cup of tea. Definitely one of my favorites in this series.Update: 12/22/22 - Every bit as good second time around!
