A good Discworld book that explores the early lives of City Watch characters

Check out my new youtube channel where I show my instant reactions to reading fantasy books seconds after I finish the book.

Night Watch is a solid entry into the Discworld universe, but unfortunately for me it rates lower than some of the earlier City Watch books. While it is more thought provoking than the other City Watch books, it doesn't deliver as many laugh out loud moments. Please don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed reading this book. But I've read from many people that this is the best Discworld book and I wanted to like it a lot more than I did. I did like that it successfully integrated reading about the earlier lives of many characters that I know and love, and was one of the better books I've read that tried to pull that off. But I go into Discworld books wanting to smile the whole time, and laugh every few pages -- and this just didn't happen.
