While Terry Pratchett is known for the humor in his Discworld series, I enjoy them primarily because-- while on the surface, his books do indeed classify as humor, he also writes these almost painful realities, very human thoughts and incredibly immersive emotions in situations that you generally don't find in most humorous fantasy/sci-fi which tends more towards parody and caricatures. Though, I wouldnâ€™t exactly say that the Discworld series isn't a parody-- because his books are parodies, or social commentaries. They just happen to parody the real world more than parodying the fantasy genre.In the Nightwatch series of books, this being the first one, you are introduced to a series of ragtag characters who are disrespected and disillusioned. Then a Heroic character is introduced into the ranks. This Heroic character proves to be the inspiration and catalyst necessary for the members of the Nightwatch to stand up and finally do what they wanted to do somewhere deep in their hearts (even if, in some characters' cases, this need was buried very deeply). Be upright, respectable guards. Uphold the law. They wanted to make a difference. They wanted to matter.And by the end of the story, they do.The conclusion of this story had me nearly in tears-- it was humble and inspirational, and an entirely hilariously exciting read. I have so much love for them and their story. <3
