*anguished screaming*you BACKSTABBING TRAITOROUS LITTLE-Never have I wanted so many people to die in the most 
painful
 way possible, especially AFTER WHAT THEY DID *sobs*I want to die🙂And I have nobody to blame but myself—oH WAIT NO I BLAME KUANG. The way she quite literally ripped out my heart and shred it into pieces...this hollow, broken feeling—like the world's ending and nobody sees it but me...is this what death feels like?I may sound overdramatic to some which is literally me in all my reviews but trust me when I say that this author is a 
monster
 haha that rhymed :' )But she's also a brilliant, worship-worthy monster. I'm both screaming in rage and crying in awe because of the sheer perfection of The Dragon Republic. Everything—and I mean E V E R Y T H I N G was just a masterpiece. If possible, she made me love all the characters even more and the plot...ohmygod I love it. I love this. I love everything.And the way she made me actually question who was truly evil. What defines 'evil'? Are some actions justified because the reasoning behind it is good? What is considered 'good'? Everyone has their own story in the end, and if one does not know it, you'll never be able to decide whether they're evil or not. And even then, it's based on our perception of good and evil to determine this. I love the way Kuang made me 
think
 and how deep she went into this. It's not all black and white. It's very, very gray and nobody is as they seem to be.I went into this with the generic thinking of good/evil and came out with a completely different opinion on this. I am once again shooketh....and broken, dead, and destroyed. *sobs*Kudos to Kuang for turning me into an emotional mess.⊱ ────── {⋅. ❈ .⋅} ────── ⊰

“People will seek to use you or destroy you. If you want to live, you must pick a side. So do not shirk from war, child. Do not flinch from suffering. When you hear screaming, run toward it.”

Oh Rin, my beautiful power-hungry, stubborn, and vicious anti-hero whom I'm very much in love with. Sure, she makes a lot of questionable decisions and has many, many flaws, but she still manages to get back up and not fall to others...for the most part.Also, where in 
The Poppy War
, she was considered to be very selfish, here Rin learned to put the fate of her country before her—even if it meant losing her pride and dignity and ugh I love her. It frustrated me that she was forced to do...certain things because of some repulsive monsters who deserve to die *cough* Petra *cough*. i would never

“She had a weapon now. She wasn't defenseless against him. She'd never been defenseless. She had just never thought to look.”

And then Rin's obsession with Altan Trengsin...I actually can't say it was super annoying because I could understand the 
why
 behind it. I mean, that's what added onto her character growth eventually, and in a way Altan was such a key figure to everyone, but especially to Rin.The growth in Rin is spot on, and with how this ended I can't wait for Rin to destroy everyone. I👏AM👏READY👏FOR👏CHAOS👏 but not for heartbreak⊱ ────── {⋅. ❈ .⋅} ────── ⊰

"Do you love him?""Yes, more than anyone else in the world."

Every time I see a scene like this, I break apart. Kitay and Rin's friendship is what makes me feel alive. He doesn't hold back on the truth from Rin and tells it how it is if she's done something bad. All they go through, they do it together and have such a deep and strong bond -- I want to cry.And with something that beautiful during war and written by Kuang herself...it's not going to last long BECAUSE SHE'S EVIL.I pray nothing happens, but by the way everyone's been coming out of The Burning God...ahahahaha *nervous laughter*I still have hope though. Kitay must survive. He must be happy. If not, I will die even tho im already deadWar has changed Kitay so much and that's definitely not surprising, but how much it's changed him is heartbreaking, but also amazing. He can talk down to generals and make them listen to him, but he's suffered so much -- it kills me :((⊱ ────── {⋅. ❈ .⋅} ────── ⊰

“I’m scared I’ll hurt you. Adlaga won’t be the end. I can’t make the Phoenix go away and I can’t make it stop and—”“Because you’re new to this,” Baji interrupted. He sounded so kind. How could he be so kind? “We’ve all been there. They want to use your body all the time. And you think you’re on the brink of madness, you think that this moment is going to be when you finally snap, but it’s not.”“How do you know that?”“Because it gets easier every time. Eventually you learn to exist on the precipice of insanity.”“But I can’t promise I won’t—”“You won’t. And we’ll go after Daji again. And we’ll keep doing it, over and over, as many times as it takes, until she’s dead. Tyr didn’t give up on us. We’re not giving up on you. This is why the Cike exists.”

All of that should be enough to tell you how much I love the Cike -- especially Baji and Ramsa *sobs* they're so sweet and hilarious. Baji, the idiotic, lovable shaman who constantly makes dirty jokes and Ramsa, everyone's cinnamon roll who's obsessed with explosives.Basically my favourite characters, even though they didn't appear as much as they did in The Poppy War. My heart is so full of love which is why to say it HURT WHEN THEY DIED is definitely an understatement OHMYGOD I WANT TO DIE AGAIN WTH KUANG WHAT THE HELL. MY POOR BABIES KILLED. CURSE YOU VAISRA. CURSE YOU NEZHA. CURSE YOU HESPERIANS. ALL OF YOU CAN DIE AND GO TO HELL. RIN ISTG SHOW NO MERCY. KILL THEM ALLEven Chaghan...like wow, I actually despised him in the previous book, but now I see everything in a 
new light
. Chaghan is in so much pain :(( and he doesn't know what to do with this and feels all alone. I really can't wait to see him and Rin team up next book (hopefully...?).Now, I've stayed silent long enough.🛑SPOILERS for TPW and up to chapter 6 of TDR🛑 DO NOT GO PAST THIS IF YOU HAVENT READ THAT. (Skip to the bottom.)You've been warned⊱ ────── {⋅. ❈ .⋅} ────── ⊰

Why was it that whenever she looked at Nezha, she wanted to either kill him or kiss him? He made her either furious or deliriously happy. The one thing he did not make her feel was secure.With him there was no neutrality, no in between. She loved him or she hated him, but she didn’t know how to do both.

Same, Rin, same. I wasn't surprised that Nezha was alive because Twitter and it's ✨spoilers✨ but ahhhhh I was so happy to see him again at first.However, this boy is a very complicated human being, and of course that's not a bad thing, but I both hate and love him. As of now, that hatred is overpowering the love, so ahahaha who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Even after what The Third Poppy War did to him, he's still my beautiful boy who truly believes in a world of peace and happiness...so optimistic -- how he can still act like this? I have no idea. AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT UNTIL HE BETRAYED THEM ALL THAT LITTLE- his parents are trash and deserve to be thrown in hellOh, and the romance that blossomed between Nezha and Rin was so sweet and heart-wrenching that is UNTIL HE BETRAYED HER AND GOT BAJI AND RAMSA KILLED IN THE PROCESS. *scream* *rage* *cries* asdfgfhgfdsagds my heart is dying because of everything they said to each other. I want to 
strangle
 the two. tHe AnGsT I hate you Yin Nezha <3⊱ ────── {⋅. ❈ .⋅} ────── ⊰

“If nothing lasted and the world did not exist, all that meant was that reality was not fixed. The illusion she lived in was fluid and mutable, and could be easily altered by someone willing to rewrite the script of reality.”

I cried myself to sleep and woke up with one thought:
"Burn them all, Rin."
I think that says something about me. But this deep burning rage I feel after everything that's happened...show them 
no mercy
, Rin. Make them 
suffer
. MAKE THEM PAY.I will not be satisfied until I see certain people killed and if that doesn't happen -- I'm giving TBG 1 star not true, but I need to threaten somethingAm I ready to come out of TBG alive? No, I am not.🙂(5⭐)⊱ ────── {⋅. ❈ .⋅} ────── ⊰Reviews:The Poppy War: ★★★★.5The Dragon Republic: ★★★★★The Burning God: ★★★★.5
