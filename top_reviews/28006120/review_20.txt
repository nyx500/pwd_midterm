*I sit at a table lit by a single lamp, surrounded by two mental manifestations*Cynical Natalie: Well, well, well. How the turn tablesMe: Um, yes. I realize it's been a while—Cynical Natalie: A yearNice Natalie: We don't know for certain it's been a year! We don't really keep track of these thingsCynical Natalie: Shut up, ass-kisser. You ignore us for an entire year, penning lackluster rushed reviews, all because you've been getting deeper into the dating game. And now you have the audacity to sit us at this table—with no food either—and ask us to do your dirty workMe: ...Nice Natalie: ...Cynical Natalie: ...Nice Natalie: ...Does that mean I get to go first?Cynical Natalie: Fuck you. Magnus Chase is officially proof that we've outgrown Rick Riordan. We didn't laugh out loud once during reading. Not once. Plus, age factor aside, it's the same old quest narrative. Oh, the world's about to end. Oh, we have have to go on this quest. Oh, we have to battle/outwit/meet an encyclopedic of mythical monsters. Tell me, over a decade after the original Percy Jackson series came out, why do none of Riordan's characters brush up on their respective mythology on their downtime? It could save their fucking lives. Don't tell me they're lazy teenagers.Nice Natalie: I think you're being too harsh. (Cynical Natalie: Big surprise) You're only complaining because we've outgrown Riordan. If you liked the book, none of those flaws you mentioned would matterCynical Natalie: Nope. I'd still rip it to shredsNice Natalie: Besides, the Magnus Chase series is a testament to Riordan's self-education and wokeness. He strives to make his books more diverse now. He even started a publishing imprint specifically for books about lesser known mythologies, written by authors from different minorities. Alex Fierro is a gender-fluid character in a middle-grade book. It offers an accessible way for children and teens to learn about the gender spectrum and normalize it in their eyes Cynical Natalie: Eh, I suppose. Alex is a very simplified representation though. They don't suffer from gender dysphoria or anythingNice Natalie: Why do they have to? Gender-fluid people don't have to be all angsty about their person or genderCynical Natalie: I'll concede to that, but you can't deny Percy Jackson's cameo is blatant fanservice. Just leave the boy alone already. He's likely got hives by nowNice Natalie: Oh, but we love Percy!Cynical Natalie: Not anymore. All these fucking new books and content about him. You can't miss something if it's never gone. If anything, it's making me indifferent towards the franchiseNice Natalie: *GASP* You take that back!Cynical Natalie: I. Am. Indifferent. Towards. Percy. Jackson.Nice Natalie: Cynical Natalie: Since we broke my twin, I'll issue the final rating. 3 stars, and that's us being generous. *to Nice Natalie* Oh, quit blubbering.
