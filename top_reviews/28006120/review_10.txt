An amazing ending to an amazing trilogy! I truly love how funny Riordan is able to make his books and I feel as though he’s found the perfect balance between teaching mythology, serious topics, and a healthy dose of humor!The whole crew is so loveable and each has very distinct personalities. I love the group dynamic and I love how understanding they are to one another. My favorite part of the magnus chase series had been actually learning Norse mythology. It’s one of the ones I’ve been least exposed to and therefor had the most to learn about. I actually feel like I understand it better after this!
