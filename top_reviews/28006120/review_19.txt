Name a book by Uncle Rick that i did NOT enjoy, i'll wait.   "I figured something out. You can’t hold on to hate forever. It won’t do a thing to the person you hate, but it’ll poison you, sure enough."  What a fantastic, amazing, and worthy conclusion to this trilogy! I'm glad with how things were settled. There were some scenes where i was grinning and laughing like an idiot and also scenes that made me feel pain and tear up.  "The world will end. The big picture cannot be changed. But in the meantime, as Loki once said, we can choose to alter the details. That’s how we take control of our destiny."  While reading TJ's, Mallory's, and Halfborn's past, i felt like my heart broke a little. They truly died as heroes and that's the reason why they are so cool. Just like Magnus said:Mallory is the fiercest fighter and she keeps the team together.Halfborn is the bravest and most stupendous for battling while wearing no shirt.TJ is the heart and soul of our fellowship. I love his enthusiasm.Heart and Blitzen. There are no words to describe how much i adore them both in sign language. Hearth is the best rune magician-elf and Blitz is the best and most fashionable dwarf in the whole nine worlds. #BlitzstoneSamirah. Indeed, her stamina is steel, her faith is unnerving and she is a daughter of Loki who is better than Loki. That's why y'all need to stan her!Alex Fierro, the secret weapon. I just love Alex. Period. #FierroChaseMagnus Chase, our MC. “Loki, you asked me who I am? I’m part of this team. I’m Magnus Chase from floor nineteen, Hotel Valhalla. I’m the son of Frey, son of Natalie, friend of Mallory, Halfborn, T.J., Blitzen, Hearthstone, Samirah, and Alex. This is my family! This is my othala. I know they will always support me, which is why I’m standing here, triumphant, on your ship, surrounded by my family, and you…even in the midst of thousands, you. Are. Still. Alone.” 💯💯 Jack or Sumarbrander. Yep, i saved the best for last. He's the greatest talking and singing sword to exist. I hope he can find his soulmate or swordmate. That's all. I like the diversity and the plot. I enjoyed this trilogy a lot. Five "fabulously weird" stars!Thank you Uncle Rick for not disappointing Charms.   "You think the world is one way, then you find out it’s much bigger and stranger than you ever imagined. If you can’t expand your thinking, you’re not going to do well in the afterlife."
