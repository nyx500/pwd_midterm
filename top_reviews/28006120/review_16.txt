Oh, Magnus! You are the best!I have been trying to decide what it is about these that I love so much. I have really, REALLY liked the Percy Jackson and the Heroes of Olympus books, but I LOOOVE Magnus. And I realized that it's because Magnus is, well, such a sweetheart. He is a genuinely compassionate and just sweet guy, and I adore him for that. His first thought, in any situation, is how to take care of his friends. He knows he's not a good fighter, and he doesn't like fighting, so he's always looking for other options and ways they can talk things out, and I adore him for it. He's also funny, but without being mean or snarky, and naive without being stupid. He's the perfect man. I also love how Riordan, through Magnus, points out how completely crazy and occasionally gross Norse mythology is. You know me, you know these are my ancestors, you know I read a lot of Norse mythology. But let's face it: a ship made out of the finger and toenails of the unredeemed dead? That's DISGUSTING. And what would that LOOK like?! The fact that Loki once turned into a beautiful lady horse, and later had an eight-legged horse baby?! That's, as the kids say, completely CRAY-CRAY. And I love the cast of characters in this. Samirah El-Abbas and her magical hijab. Alex and her green and pink fashions. Blitzen and Hearthstone, the ultimate surrogate dad/older brothers. I just melted with love for poor Amir, who is doing his normal human best to not freak the frak out and be supportive of all this, and who brought Magnus a cooler of falafel sandwiches for their deadly quest. Amir! You're awesome!So, if you haven't read this series, DO IT. The first book is The Sword of Summer. If you haven't read any Rick Riordan, go ahead and start with The Sword of Summer, too. Just . . . just read these books, guys. They're great!
