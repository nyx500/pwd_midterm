LOVED this trilogy. The Beka Cooper books have a strong finish. Mastiff is particularly well crafted, with an exciting plot, excellent character growth, and some truly heartbreaking developments. I'm sad to see the trilogy come to an end -- I want more time with these characters!(My wrap-up of the full trilogy is posted at Bookshelf Fantasies.
