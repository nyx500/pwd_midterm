I felt really disappointed by this conclusion to the Beka Cooper series. To be frank, I think it's the worst book I've read by Tamora Pierce, and really not up to her usual standards. The ending felt really rushed, the book as a whole was kinda choppy. I also felt betrayed by Ms Pierce's portrayal of her characters. I love how well she makes her characters, how believable and strong they are, but that just wasn't in this book. Beka starts the book coming out of a abusive relationship that lasted some months. Given her personality and history, and the care of her friends, it just doesn't seem believable. Neither does her relationship with Farmer, the new character in the book. Her attachment to him comes on fast and there isn't as much development with their relationship as what I've come to expect, and love, from Ms. Pierce's books.Added to that is the fact that the crew and characters from the first two books didn't make much of an appearance and that Tunstall's final actions weren't believable. I usually love an unexpected twist, but usually the author sets the circumstances so that, when revealed, the surprise can be accepted. Save the last few pages, Tunstall didn't give any indication, in this book or the others, of even being capable of the level of betrayal that he performed, and the reason given didn't make that much sense. Tunstall never mentioned wanting to marry at all, or that he was dissatisfied that much with the nature of his relationship with Sabine. I haven't given up on Ms. Pierce's writing, but this particular trilogy went from one of my favorites of hers, to one I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
