With this final installment of Beka Cooper's story, I can confidently say that this series of Tortall books is equal to the Protector of the Small books, which had been my runaway favorite series of Tamora Pierce's (and given how much I enjoy all of her books, this is high praise indeed). The protagonist, Beka Cooper, is the medieval version of an inner city cop. We follow her from her probationary days in the slums of Corus in "Terrier" to foiling a counterfeiting ring in "Bloodhound," to preventing a coup in "Mastiff," with the help of her excellent partners, a scent hound named Achoo, a sarcastic magical cat, and her own method of communicating with departed souls that ride on the backs of pigeons. This book is as emotionally gripping as it is thrilling to read, and the pacing never flags as Beka and her allies pursue their quarry despite numerous roadblocks, some extremely nasty enemies, and betrayals. I confess to crying twice while reading this book, and the tears were hard-earned. There are many familiar themes here as the Tortall of Beka's time begins to show signs of evolving into the Tortall we know from previous books. The ending is a triumph, eliciting a rather mammoth lump in my throat. Read with a sense of adventure and heart, and you will be well-rewarded. Recommended for all fans of YA fantasy and people who love stories about strong, capable women.
