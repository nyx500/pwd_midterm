Overall Rating : B"To me, that noble honor is a wonderful thing. I see folk put it on and take it off all the time, and no one ever notices how wrinkled it gets."Okay, I admit, this made me tear up a bit, and gasp, and laugh out loud. And the ending tied up perfectly with her other books, making me a happy camper.I will say this. That plot twist? Should not have happened. Not in a million years. So I'm going to ignore it and strike it from my memory. It just wasn't something that I would have believedTunstall would have NEVER betrayed Beka and Sabine. It wasn't in his character. And even killing a kid???? Not on his life. Which did end at least peacefully. If it makes it any better., especially leading from the other two books.I'm glad I was able to finish the series. I was afraid I wouldn't since it was taking me so long to finish, but thank goodness that was just a reading slump. It shows that old books CAN be great books. So give them some love.
