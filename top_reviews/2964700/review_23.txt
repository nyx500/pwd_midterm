The Beka Cooper series has proven to be my favorite of all the writings of Tamora Pierce. Except. This last volume of the series. It's hard to say this about a volume of this size, but it felt as if the writing was rushed. Publishers, give your writers a break. Pushing deadlines doesn't help either of you, and can blow up in your face like this one. Not up to her usual standards. I agree with other reviewers that the characterizations and use of characters, usually one of Pierce's strengths, goes haywire in this volume. The plot is excellent, the story timeline and development are good. I enjoyed the story, but was thoroughly disappointed by the endings. I feel the book was unfinished and should not have been published in its current form. I would like to see it rewritten, republished, in a more well written and well developed form. As it stands, it is not quite satisfying. That said, I'll probably end up rereading it just because I love the first two volumes so much and will read the complete series straight through.
