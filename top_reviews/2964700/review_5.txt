I. LOVE. THIS. TRILOGY.In the first book, we see Beka learning the ropes alongside Goodwin and Tunstall. In book two, she goes on a Hunt with Goodwin, and by this book, she's partnered with Tunstall since Goodwin was promoted. So it's familiar territory. And where, with Bloodhound, I'd wrangled a hunch early on, this kept me guessing up until the reveal (literally the last fifty pages, they were insane), aside from a few sneaking suspicions about a few secondary characters. But the Cat (Pounce Master Saucebox is his forever name) really steals the show in this book, especially in the end. Gods I can't wait to get him immortalized in my next tattoo, ugh <3And for any of you keeping track, there was one instance where I ought to have bawled my eyes out, and another where this poor paperback would otherwise have been thrown across the room. Just so y'all are forewarned ;) BUT IT'S FANTASTIC AND IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS TRILOGY YOU'RE SO MISSING OUT. Beka might be my new favorite Tortallan heroine. idk I have to reread the Aly duology here pretty soon, I haven't read her books in years. I will also say that it took a good while for me to warm up to Farmer. He crept up on me like... I dunno. Like the relationship I'm in (and have been in for the past 4+ years), I suppose. His presence was always very calming and steady, a good guy to have around. I didn't feel like he and Beka had real chemistry, but I think that's because the romance was never really thrown in your face-- that is, Beka was never nervous around him or visibly crushing on him or anything like that. So that was really refreshing, I think. They make a good pair, and I LOVE that she proposed AND he wanted to take her last name.Happy sighs. Now I want to reread this trilogy all over again <3
