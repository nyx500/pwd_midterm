2020 reread: I reread it again and it’s SUCH a good ending! It answers a question I never thought to ask: why is Tortall so progressive when it’s surrounded by so many countries with slavery? Also, George Cooper’s POV opening and closing of the series is *chefs kiss*! I would love to read all of HIS diaries!I want to say something about Rosto. Yes, I would’ve loved it if they got together but the fact that they didn’t is a very big part of how Beka’s character was set up. There is also a very common trope(? Cliche?) of women falling for the first flashy character they encounter in a story/movie/ show. Tamora Pierce has shown in this and other series that she won’t always go that route. It’s actually refreshing to me. So, Beka didn’t end up with the first nor the second nor the longtime (rogue) friend who had a thing for her. You see now why she couldn’t end up with him? That would’ve in a way been a rewrite of Alana’s and George Cooper’s story. I’m glad to see a happily ever after where the girl doesn’t end up with “the one” on the first try.  Actually, I’m VERY happy with Farmer. The man pulled a magic ribbon out of his ass, people! What else do you want from the man?? It’s enough for me!😂😂————————Is it just me or is there something wrong with Beka's head?Right there! On the cover.It looks like something you'd see in a horror flick...
