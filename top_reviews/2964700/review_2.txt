The final Beka book is probably my favorite. Oddly it begins with Beka mourning the loss of her Dog lover. And goes on to become a true classic quest. There is Beka (shall we call her the ranger?), a mage, a paladin, and a rogue. I didn't realize this until this most recent reread. Pierce has fun with the tropes and delves once more into the horrors of the common folk in medieval times (basically). It's nice to see a fantasy that doesn't glorify nobility to the expense of all reality. For those of you who, like me, yearn for a happy ever after, don't you worry. Beka gets that too. But then if you've read the Alanna books you already know that, for we have all met her marvelous long after progeny.(And yes, before you ask, George Cooper is my ideal man. So there.)
