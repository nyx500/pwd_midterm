4.5 stars. A terrific end to a terrific series. Beka Cooper, Tunstall, and a mage, Farmer, are tasked with finding the kidnapped son of their king. They encounter problem after problem, and are repeatedly attacked by a terrible foe, who thinks nothing of killing innocents. It's a hard case to solve, and is basec in mage and noble opposition to the King's taxes, but solve it she does, with much help from great scent hound Achoo, Farmer and Lady Sabine, who joins the group. Beka both loses and gains a lot by the end of this story, which was well worth reading. She's a wonderful protagonist, and I love her strength, steadfastness, doggedness, and kindness as she's worked her way up from Terrier to Mastiff. I had been leery of reading this series for so long, assuming that it would be more boring swords and sorcery-based fantasy. I am so glad I was wrong. I really, really liked this series and want to read more stories in the Tortall universe.
