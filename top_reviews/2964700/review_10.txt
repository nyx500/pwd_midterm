"Mastiff is a somewhat disappointing conclusion to Tamora Pierce's Beka Cooper series. I liked this entry better than the previous book in the trilogy, but neither approached the quality of the first book. There are many interesting and entertaining elements hereâ€”I enjoyed seeing how magic can be used for detective work and forensic investigation and was charmed by the new member of Beka's hunt team, but the book feels somewhat slap-dash despite its length and it has a number of odd inconsistencies that the editor should have flagged. More time for the author to revise and a stronger editor would have made for a stronger narrative. The controversial subplot that is receiving extensive criticism in other reviews felt unnecessary and contrived. Beka is strong, kind, intelligent and has incorruptible integrity. It is a pleasure to spend more time with her, but she shines best in the lower city, which does not enter into this story at all. I realize that the writer had a serious message about the degradation and dehumanization caused by slavery, but the level of violence used to convey that message makes this excursion to Tortall rather off-putting. This book, even more than the other two in the trilogy, is more suitable for adults and older teenagers than for younger readers.
