The out of the way, out of the war, green planet Gardenia is the next stop, as we move on to a few years later for Alana, Marko, Hazel, Klara and Friendo (who??). What starts off as a family living quietly on an outpost planet, descends into trouble, as they haven't been forgotten by those that are after them. Also, there's Ghuus :)This series! - on so many levels - gay partners/ detectives - the android class system - Hazel's family - Friendo - and of course the unsurpassable art of Fiona Staples, as per. - it all works so well, on so many levels. One of the solid storytelling devices used continuously in Saga, is not foreshadowing, but blatant foretelling, and instead of being spoiler-y, it adds to the authenticity of Hazel's narration. Although the weakest volume so far, still a 10 out of 12, still a Five Star Read! How can this be! What's the secret of Saga's genius?
