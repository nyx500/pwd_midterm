I'M SWALLOWING THESE BOOKS FASTER THAN ALANA DOES FADEAWAY DRUGS.And I don't know about you, but if that wasn't just some fantastic character development and maturity for Marko right there, then Mama Sun's a saint sent straight from the heavens. Would have loved to see more of the other characters than we did, but boOOoOoOoy oh boy am I still invested in this story than ever.I'm coming for you, Vol 5!!! No seriously, expect a review to follow in t-minus 2 hours. This shit really is like drugsâ€” the best frickin' kind of them.
