My favorite volume so far! The art? Stunning. The plot? A+.Despite it being one of the shorter volumes, so much happened. I think part of the reason this was so successful was the time jump. The past three volumes have all occurred back to back, and there wasn't much time for new obstacles to pop up. Volume 4 has a new villain who actually frightens me as well as new strain on Alana and Marko's relationship. Not to mention Sophie has grown up into a fierce little girl.Now, I'm not sure if this is really the best volume so far or if I've become more used to the vulgar and abrasiveness of this series, which has allowed me to enjoy the story more. Maybe both?I read the past four volumes in less than 12 hours (they are seriously addictive), so I'm taking a breather. But then watch out! I'll be marathoning the rest for sure.P.S. Can I please adopt Gh√ºs?
