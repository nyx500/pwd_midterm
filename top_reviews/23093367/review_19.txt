Re-Read 5/14/18:So I'm revising this down to four stars. Why? Because it is, conceivably, the weakest of all the volumes. It's not that it's bad, but that so many crappy things happen... or are caused by... the characters I love the most.Too much whining, too much indulgence, and just when they're both acting the most selfishly, FATE has to intervene. So. Crap. This is the downturn. This is the start of a tragedy that, fortunately, is not forever. Things GET BETTER. *Sob* But first, sometimes, an alien has to hit bottom first.Original Review:NOOOOO...I'm gonna kill the person who created serials. Seriously. I'm gonna clone the shit out of him or her and then kill em. This ending is so completely unfair now that I'm this freaking hooked.
