The Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter is the best fantasy debut I've read this year. This surprised me, because I've been generally trying to get away from books about great wars and warriors, lofty magic and military organizations being the centre of the story. Yet Winter's debut kept me captivated precisely because he managed to do what many of those books seem to avoid: he kept the story incredibly contained within the life of its main character.Tau is a Lesser – a low-caste commoner in this African-inspired fantasy realm. He's neither particularly strong nor skilled and, quite frankly, would be pretty fine with avoiding military service altogether and trying to build a life with Zuri, the girl he loves and who might just love him back. But, of course, in such a hierarchical society, injustice is at the very root of life, and it soon comes to destroy Tau's hopes and dreams. Watching the way in which Tau deals with those losses is simultaneously heartbreaking and inspiring, both epically grand and yet nuanced.Tau is neither true hero nor callous Grimdark-style anti-hero. He's just dealing with the hand fate has dealt him and wrestling with every decision along the way. He becomes obsessive about becoming the deadliest swordsman he can be, and along this journey makes sacrifices that carve out pieces of his soul. Always Zuri comes back into the picture, though, and tries to bring Tau back to the boy he once was.All of this against the backdrop of dragons, armies, a fascinating magic system, and a spirit of camaraderie that fans of old-school fantasy will appreciate just as much as those looking to go beyond European-inspired medievalist tales will enjoy a new cultural context for their fantastical tales. Put together, all of this makes The Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter a captivating read for fantasy fans old and new.
