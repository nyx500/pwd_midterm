Revenge and battle! Tau has everything ripped away from him and will go to any length to become a warrior capable of taking his revenge. There's scary magic, a demon world, and nonstop fighting. There was actually too much fighting for me, but at least the battles were well written.I love the middle section of this book, in which all of the battles gain urgency as a subjugated battle school group rises up against super-sized and magical nobles to prove that they're equals. We even get a fantastic lovable antagonist who Tau absolutely wants dead. There's great tension there, as we see both perspectives and can't help but root for revenge regardless.The opening and ending (more battles) are a bit less gripping for me but still engaging. There's a lot at stake in both, as whole cultures are put at risk of extermination. But for me, the personal struggles were always more interesting, which meant the intense middle really captured my heart.I also would have loved more women characters with more to say, though what women are here all have extreme magic.If you're looking for good battles and an epic fantasy inspired by southern African history (but with more demon magic), this one is for you.
