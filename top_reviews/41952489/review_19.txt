HOLY COW i wish i'd read this sooner, i literally stayed up until the early hours of the morning reading this because i couldn't put it down! The setting is unique and fascinating and the world development is remarkably well done, i really felt like i was in this story with Tau and really enjoyed his character development too. Chef's kiss!
