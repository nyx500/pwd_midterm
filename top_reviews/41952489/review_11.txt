“And, like that, there was no going back. A Dragon had been called and someone would have to die.”

The Rage of Dragons was one of the most hyped fantasy releases of 2019 and I believe there are great reasons for that. The story was originally self-published before Orbit decided to traditionally publish it with a new cover and some edits. I mean it is a story about revenge, it has dragons, a great cover (I am even a fan of the self-published cover) and the author seems like a very cool person and it has African-inspired settings so I had to buy a hardcover copy of this and read it.Last year I read Priory of the Orange Tree and I was unfortunately very disappointed with it. I thought that maybe this book will give me the dragons we deserve. I ended up enjoying the story very much but for different reasons. Although the title contains the word “Dragon” they don’t have a big role in the story so far (this being a keyword) but I believe they will and I believe the story itself was excellent without the Dragons part.The story is a revenge story, it is also a military fantasy story so the story may not fit the taste of every reader. The story is a bit dense, starts with many terms and information (The Glossary at the end of the book is very important in my opinion), It made getting into the story a bit of a challenge but the prologue was certainly intriguing enough to capture my attention from the start so I knew I was going to finish the book. 

“I’d rather live with a thing done poorly than do nothing and always wonder how things could have been.”

The writing is very good though, there were many quotes worth highlighting. The book did not feel like a debut at all and Winter definitely raised the bar for new fantasy authors.The characters were great, diverse and it is just refreshing to see POC characters written by an author of color in a fantasy setting with an African setting. All of it is just a derail from the stereotypical themes we are used to. The story has a wide cast of characters who were distinct and do grow through the story. At the same time, the story was very action-packed with a nice (not complex) magic system that kept me on toes while reading the book. I am used to slower books as I am reading more adult fantasy but this was a mix of non-stop action while still sustaining the focus on characters, a perfect mix in my opinion! 

“The days without difficulty are the days you do not improve.”

Summary: Winter wrote an epic debut which was unusual for its settings, action-packed chapters and characters. I think the revenge story is not something new but the author still managed to put his own twist on it and make it unique which explains the success it has been finding. I am very satisfied by this debut and I can’t wait for the second book!You can get more books from Book Depository
