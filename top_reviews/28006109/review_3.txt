4.5/5HOLY CRAP THIS WAS INTENSE. I can’t even imagine how wild the finale to this series is going to be!This book made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me FEEL. The only reason it isn’t five stars is that it didn’t feel as layered as the Burning Maze was. And I would have loved for some more side character development. But oh well, it was awesome either way, and I cannot wait for the last one!
