Reading this book felt more like a duty rather than a hobby for me. I still remember how much I loved the previous book, The Burning Maze, which made me scream in shock after I finished. Yet The Tyrant's Tomb didn't give me any of those feelings, it failed.Lester, aka Apollo, embraced a new journey in this book to Camp Jupiter. He and Meg met Lavinia while fighting off some hideous creatures. This should have been interesting with Rick Riordan's writing style that astounded me whenever I read his books, but it didn't work at all. I felt bored. I wanted to skip some chapters so badly, anyway, I waited and hoped that Uncle Rick might have something up his sleeve.No, he didn't have. Around the middle of the book, I was fed up with Lester even though his character had been developed since the first book but when it comes to The Tyrant's Tome, everything just stops. Character development. Humor. Climax. Pace. Everything just bored me to death. There is only filler in this book that will lead us to the last book which is about warring with Nero, aka the Beast.Also, at some point, I felt Jason's death was insignificant. I stopped caring. I couldn't even remember how that happened. The story in The Tyrant's Tomb is delivered to readers by telling, forcing them to acknowledge instead of showing them and letting them analyze.2.5-3 Stars for The Tyrant's Tomb.
