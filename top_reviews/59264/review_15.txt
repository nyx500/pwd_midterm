NO FREAKING WAY. NO.LYS GO HIDE IN A CORNER. "I want to see what you think of the ending"By now I should know that when Lys says that, I'm going to suffer. I mean, I didn't see that coming. At all. And it was a fitting and beautiful ending but...but, my heart is crushed, broken in little pieces! T.TIt's kind of pointless to talk about the plot, because I don't want to spoil the series for anyone. I loved Bartimaeus (Barty :3) and Nathaniel. I've always liked Kitty's character but I've never loved her part in the story. To me, this series will always be about Bartimaeus and Nathaniel and no one else.
