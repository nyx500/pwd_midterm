I understood the character Mandrake wholly, why he was scared,frightened or arrogant. And towards the end i was so proud that he was becoming such a wonderful person,i even hoped following this Kitty and him could be involved romantically, they had some sparks between them, but then JS had to do the inevitable, he took my beloved (cheesily feels for a character)just as he began living. Tears were in my eyes,I had to stop myself from crying.I knew JS would do something horrible, and had a terrible feeling it was going to be Kitty or Mandrake. And there you go, like a fist pounding my heart, gone. And it hurt more than i expected because I practically GREW up physically and mentally with Mandrake( its funny i read all the books around his ages , when i was 10,then 13, then 15). As his demise neared all i wanted to do was tell Mandrake i loved him, no joke, no one deserves to die without hearing those words told with sincerity. SO there it is, Ptolemy and Mandrake my lovelies. If magic is possible in that world, i hope in this book there is also heaven-like afterlife , because they deserve a chance at peace & happiness.I also thank Bartimaeus for giving them a taste of true friendship.My main point being it was an amazing book,using different methods i.e the fantastic plot and fantastic writing style, it really propelled me into 'living' in it.
