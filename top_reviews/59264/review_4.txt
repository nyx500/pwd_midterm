This book is very close to 5 stars...let us say it's another of those 4.5 books. I can recommend it and I do, but with a caveat, it is considered to be a youth or YA book. Be sure that your "youth" is mature enough for the book. I will go so far as to add a spoiler below for those who wish to know in more detail what I mean. This is the third in the Bartimaeus Trilogy. They are good books, and deal with in an over all sense attitudes of cooperation and equality. The Magicians are the ruling class here and the "commoners" those who aren't magicians mostly "exist" simply for the and to serve the needs and wants of the ruling class, said magicians. The Jinn and other beings from the other place are enslaved by the magicians. With everyone basically hating the magicians I think you can see how things might go. Throughout the trilogy we have followed Nathanial (the human who becomes a magician), Bartimaeus the Jinni, and Kitty a girl in the resistance. The stories are very well done, have some great (even humorous) dialog, and draw the reader in. If you're a parent be sure that your "youth" has a good reality concept and is mature enough for a story that turns somewhat dark at times.**** SPOILER ALERT SPOILER BELOW ****The end of this book took me by complete surprise...and that doesn't happen much anymore. I am about to reveal the ending surprise to the story so if you don't want to read it read no further. I include it here for parents who may wish to know before allowing children to read or listen to these books.****SPOILER BELOW ****We follow Nathanial or John Mandrake through all the books till the last. In the final book the magicians are duped by the Jinn into allowing them to enter into them or possess them. The Jinn promptly destroy the magicians minds as this is the only way they can be summoned into the world and not be enslaved. They then set out to take their revenge on humans, especially magicians. Now this possession angle may bother some, it didn't strike me as too bad as even though I'm a Christian, this is simply part of a story and the villains are doing villainous things...if it bothers you there it is. What got me comes next. A spent and all but powerless Nathanial and a severely weakened Bartimaeus are forced to work together. Bartimaeus enters into Nathanial but does not possess him. He doesn't harm his mind. Nathanial has promised that as soon as they destroy the most powerful "demon" he will dismiss Bartimaeus permanently. The being is stronger than they thought and after taking leave of Kitty they set out to break a magic staff, thus releasing all the staff's power at once destroying the demon. Unfortunately it will also kill them. I went on expecting the last minute reprieve, that they would somehow survive the blast, be buried under a building that would shield them from the worst of it or something as had happened a hundred times before in the books. Nathanial is badly injured already and only Bartimaeus presence is keeping him alive, Bartimaeus is too weak to survive alone here on Earth and may only survive alone if he is dismissed to go back to the other place and heal. As the evil demon closes in and Nathanial needs to break the staff, he dismisses Bartimaeus, breaks the staff and dies. The closing remarks are by Bartimaeus. If you think the death of Nathanial will be a problem for a child be aware of it.
