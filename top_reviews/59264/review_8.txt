4.5 to 5.0 stars. Having now finished the entire trilogy, I can say that this ranks in my top 5 "All Time" YA fantasy series ever. After loving the first book, The Amulet of Samarkand, I was a little disappointed in the second volume, The Golem's Eye, for reasons set out in my review. Thus I was a little worried about how the final installment would play out. Turns out that each one of my gripes about the second volume were dealt with beautifully in this story. The series ended on an incredibly high (though bittersweet) note and I could not have been happier. Bartimaeus is one of the most unique "voices" in fantasy literature over the past 10 years and I hope to read more stories with him in the near future. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!Winner: Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Young Adult Novel.
