I adored fairy tales as a child... wait, I've always adored them, even now when I'm... not a child... so many different interpretations -- truly the foundation for many of today's TV shows, movies, children's books... a must read! Who doesn't know the stories of Hansel & Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, etc. These are powerful parables meant to teach us all the lessons we need. Of course, they're fun and imaginative. But their the basics to start from. Love them.

About Me

For those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find TV & Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world. And you can find all my social media profiles to get the details on the who/what/when/where and my pictures. Leave a comment and let me know what you think. Vote in the poll and ratings. Thanks for stopping by. Note: All written content is my original creation and copyrighted to me, but the graphics and images were linked from other sites and belong to them.
