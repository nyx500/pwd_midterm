The copy that I owned as a child had Anderson's stories on the reverse - UPSIDE-MOTHERFUCKING-DOWN. I know, right? Too rad for words? Why don't I own it anymore? I presume it just fell apart from the heady love affair that I had with it. I was besotted. Rapaciously smitten. If rapacious means what I think it does. I just wanted to climb in between the covers and love it good. With or without its consent. Maybe rapacious simply means greedy, which does just as good because I was greedy for it, like a fat kid who mixed butter and sugar together and ate it as a snack. Like I may or may not have done as a kid. Whilst reading Grimm's fairytales.I will love whoever buys me a copy of the version that I had as a child with undying gratitude. It had charm, mystique, it was chunky, fat, just the right size. Just like a good man. Nothing has lived up to it's magnificence since. Oh and the stories were good too.
