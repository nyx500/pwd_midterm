Although I still and absolutely do cherish and treasure my traditional paper book copies of Jakob and Wilhem Grimm's Kinder- und Hausmärchen (of which I own various versions in both hardcover and paperback and in both German and English translation), I do nevertheless consider this here massive e-book compilation of basically the vast majority of the Brothers Grimm's fairy and folklore output both amazing and indeed also and definitely of much potential academic interest and use. Containing not only the 1812, 1815 and 1857 editions of the Brothers Grimm's Kinder- und Hausmärchen, Delphi Saemltliche Werke von Brüder Grimm (Illustrierte) (and yes, the title is indeed a bit badly rendered into German, but the internal contents, they do shine) also features their Deutsche Sagen (German legends), Irische Elfenmärchen (a collection of Irish elf and fairy tales) and last but not least Deutsche Mythologie (Jacob Grimm's take on German/Norse mythology, which I have always wanted to read but which is often really rare and massively expensive to purchase as a paper, as a traditional dead tree tome). And while this collection, and while Delphi Saemtliche Werke von Brüder Grimm (Illustrierte) does not feature Jacob Grimm's linguistic and philologic work (which would have been nice, but which I also was in no way expecting), that MOST of his and his brother's folklore and mythologic oeuvre has indeed been included is truly not only awesome but personally also very massively appreciated (not to mention that the general set up of Delphi Saemltliche Werke der Brüder Grimm (Illustrierte) and especially the tables of contents are clearly and aesthetically pleasantly organised, and yes, also quite user friendly, which is especially a boon and a godsend if one is for example trying to compare and contrast the 1812 edition of the Kinder- und Hausmärchen with the latest, with the 1857 one). Highly recommended is Delphi Saemtliche Werke von Brüder Grimm (Illustrierte) and like all of the Delphi Classics e-book tomes also extremely cost effective to purchase and download as a Kindle, but with the necessary caveat that this collection is entirely in German and therefore, a decent level of fluency in the German language is in my opinion an absolute must. And yes indeed, Delphi Classiscs also offers Delphi Complete Fariry Tales of the Brothers Grimm (Illustrated), which contains four separate sets of English language translations from 1826 to 1912, as well as the 1857 final German language edition (but unfortunately, this latter e-book does not feature any of the Grimms' additional folkloristic work, such as the above mentioned Deutsche Legenden etc., as Delphi Complete Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm (Illustrated) only focuses on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale collections).
