I was gifted a lovely edition of this - which was incredibly thoughtful, since there was no occasion for it. So, this is a 'review' as much as it is a perfect bout of nostalgia for me. There are 211 tales in here so I'm not able to, nor would I want to comment on them all.Grimm's tales are known all over the world - Hanzel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin, The Frog Prince - everyone knows these, right? What about The Old Beggar-Woman, One-Eye, Two-Eyes, And Three-Eyes, The White Bride And The Black One? I was a bit of a strange child in the sense that I was always fascinated by these beautifully dark tales. So as I peruse through this magical and beautifully bound book, I may make occasional comments on certain tales - and I hope that one day should you be curious enough, that you too pick up an unabridged copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales, and be as delighted as I am over these stories.~1. The Frog-King, or Iron HenryI used to fervently argue that the Frog Prince was never kissed, but then again, not everyone had read the Grimm's version of this childhood classic. Boo-hoo to them, because Iron Henry is perfect!
