I wish I could review each and every story in this individually, but there are soooo many. All I can say is that this has given me quite a few story ideas and its also given me quite a lot of laughter... along with probably scarring me for life, as well. :P Some of those stories are creepy!And if anyone writes a fairytale retelling of The Straw, The Coal, and The Bean... let me know, because that will be HILARIOUS. ;)
