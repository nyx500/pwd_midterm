As America continues to struggle with its white supremacy tendencies, books like Octavia E. Butler's Kindred can offer us insight and guidance. In Kindred, Dana Edwards travels back through time to a farm in pre-emancipation Maryland and witnesses/experiences slavery first hand. Kindred starts at the conclusion of Dana Edwards' time-travel adventures and then proceeds with Dana's first person narrative describing her experiences from beginning to end. This allows the narrator, Dana, to know everything that is happening before it happens while remaining unable to do anything to change the outcome. This emphasizes the fact that we can't change history. When Dana has finally managed to return home for good, she has lost part of one arm. Octavia Butler stated this was to emphasize that one can not experience slavery and remain whole. America may never fully recover from the damage caused by slavery, but we will never be able to move forward towards our national ideals until Americans accept that slavery has been an integral part of our history. America's current infatuation with white supremacy is an ugly offspring of our ugly history. Kindred is now my favorite novel and Octavia E. Butler is now my favorite novelist. I'm about to do an Octavia Butler binge. Please bear with me.13 December 2022: 10:17 AM PST "I just watched the 1st episode of the @KindredFX series on @hulu. It was great. It's based on Octavia Butlerâ€™s Kindred novel. One must make changes to adapt a novel to a multi-season TV series. So far, the changes have enhanced the show."@TimothySNull on Twitter13 December 2022: 7:12 PM PST"Part way through episode 7, I almost lost faith, but by the end of episode 8, I became a believer again. Season 1 of @KindredFX was fantastic! Different in many ways from the book, but marvelous nonetheless. I'm ready for Season 2!"@TimothySNull on Twitter
