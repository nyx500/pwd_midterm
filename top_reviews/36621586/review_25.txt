While the plot line was sometimes lost on me, the writing in this trilogy is beautiful. There were arcs in this story that almost made it feel like I was reading two separate books instead of a single cohesive one. While I enjoyed what happened in The Winter of the Witch, this was not my favorite in the series. I adored (most of) the characters in The Winternight Trilogy. Vasya is a fantastic protagonist and I was sad to reach the last page of her story.
