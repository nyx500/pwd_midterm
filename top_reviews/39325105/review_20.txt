I am not going to pretend that I understood everything that went on in this book, but I want more. Being confused is also not my fave thing, and yet, here it was fun to be completely lost. And I can’t resist the pleasure of saying names like “Necrolord Prime, The Emperor of the Nine Houses, The Prince Undying” or “Lady Harrowhark Nonagesimus, Reverend Daughter by Her Own Desire.” I like these wacky people and the incomprehensible necromantic sciences and the ghost underworld. Oh, and, of course, obscenities and juvenile jokes.I would have thrown away about 50 pages of battles towards the end of the book. Those pages were as tedious as the last half hour of every Marvel movie.
