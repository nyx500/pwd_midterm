Be prepared when going into this book to have to work hard to understand it for a number of different reasons. Then accept that you have to wait to the end before much of it becomes clear. Finally have your reading calendar cleared so you can go back and read it all again, knowing what you have finally discovered. The author weaves a very tangled web and I loved it!Harrow the Ninth is a great character and a very special necromancer. We begin to discover how special as this book progresses and we are introduced to some very major players. The bone magic throughout is horrific and clever and sounds very painful. It is not all bone breaking though. There is a lot of humour too and the book is very entertaining.I am finding it hard to review Harrow the Ninth without giving away something very important, so I will just finish by saying that I thought it was brilliant and I loved the ending and I am now waiting with bated breath for book three.
