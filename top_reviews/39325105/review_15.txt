We follow Harrow shortly after the harrowing events of the last book (sorry not sorry).She's quickly learning the secrets of the immortals from the emperor himself and it was all that she could ever remember wanting...and yet...something is off.Her memory is becoming more patchworky (or is she just noticing it now)? She feels physically ill looking at a sword and there's secrets - oh so many secrets - that could result in her death any day.But there's also a voice inside her head...one that may hold the secret to it all.After the intensity, humor and sheer badassery of the first book...I truly did not think the second could even come close. And then I read it.Oh. My. Flipping. God.Like...I can't even. I can't odd. This book has wrecked me in the best way possible.This book is so wholly different and yet brings about such sheer amazingness that I can hardly keep from reeling.If you haven't read it yet...you really ought to have started, like yesterday.
