sometimes romance isn’t romance sometimes romance is wholly tethering urself to another person in such a way that u are the beginning and the end of each other’s suffering and their forgiveness of u and sacrifice for u and desire to be consumed by u in every sense of the word becomes the literal metaphysical axis around which the universe revolves. and ur both catholic dykes who think they're going to hell no matter what btw.
