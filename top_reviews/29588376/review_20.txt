The Lies of Locke Lamora was bloody fantastic. I fell in love with these characters and the entire tone of the world! Consider swooning to be my review. There are no words to describe what a great reading experience this was for me.Just good ole' fashioned storytelling, well-constructed and captivating from beginning to end!!Lynch is a talented man and I cannot wait to continue on with the Gentleman Bastard series.
