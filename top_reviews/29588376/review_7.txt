locke lamora could rob me of all im worth and i would literally get down on my knees and thank him for the honour. he is the most deceptively clever, enticingly cunning, and gentlemanly bastard i have ever read and i cant get enough of him or his crew. you guys, this story is unreal. its so morally wrong that you dont even want it to be right. its that luring, that gritty, that bold. its masterfully chaotic - so many subplots, so many characters, so much world-building. theres never a dull moment.its intricately woven - no movement, no scene, no word is insignificant. everything is so interconnected on so many levels. i straight up got chills in some parts. its darkly humorous - oh my gosh. the banter! the jokes! the quips! the characters are so well-written and their interactions are always memorable.my only minor critique would be the lack of central female characters. this is a bunch of lads, lads, lads. and thats fine. but it would have been nice to have a constant womanly presence (one is alluded to frequently, so i hope she comes into play in the sequel). but other than that, this story is practically brilliant in every way possible. â†  4.5 stars
