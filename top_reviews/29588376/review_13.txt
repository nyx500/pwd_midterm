I'll be blunt up front and share that The Lies of Locke Lamora is one of my favorite books this year.I loved it. Ever freaking word of every line. While the main plot of the book features heist, treachery and more mutinies than you could shake a stick at – the heart of the novel lies in the epic bromance that is the Gentlemen Bastards. I am a huge fan of the ‘family that you choose yourself’ trope, so Locke and his gang of misfits tickled at my heartstrings. Make no mistake, they’re neither gentle or loving to one another – preferring to trade insults to niceties. Yet, through flashbacks and banter, the reader could feel the camaraderie between Locke and each of the member in his team. Morally ambiguous characters who look out for their own? Basically a set up after my own heart.The world-building laid the foundation to a much richer world which I am excited to explore in future books. The city of Camorr is loosely based on a medieval Venice, with once charming waterways turned sinister by presence of vicious sharks and the shadow of the criminal underworld. The city was another character unto itself, treacherous and filled with secrets. I also loved seeing the rise and fall of rival gangs, and how Locke navigated the bureaucracy of criminal societies with poise.Although most of the book was wildly entertaining, I appreciated that The Lies of Locke Lamora dared to go to dark places and take difficult roads. It would have been so easy to make Locke and the Gentlemen Bastards own all their exploits and emerge grinning. Yet, the plot throws many wrenches in Locke’s best laid plans, and the death toll is shockingly high for a book that started all banter and petty tricks. I liked that our protagonists were in true danger at some point, and they definitely did not emerge unscathed.In all, this is the type of book that any author should strive to write. And it Lynch's first.
