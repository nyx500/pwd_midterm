Κάπως πιο μελαγχολικός αυτός ο τό��ος με μια κάπως πιο θλιμμένη ατμόσφαιρα.......μου άρεσε πολύ!. -And what of your realm-I'm surre it's still there, in it's fashion. People and things are still created; still exist; are still destroyed. They tear down and they build. Things still change. The only difference is that no one running it any more. It's nothing to do with me any longer. It's theirs. They can make their own destruction.-My brother? How could you leave?-How or why?-It makes no difference.-Because there's no such thing as a one-sided coin. Because there are two sides to every sky.I like the stars. It's the illusion of permanence, I think. I mean, they're always flaring up and caving in and going out. But from here, I can pretend...I can pretend that things last. I can pretend that lives last longer than moments. Gods come, and gods go. Mortals flicker and flash and fade. Worlds don't last; and stars and galaxies are transient, fleeting things that twinkle like fireflies and vanish into cold and dust. But I can pretend.And she looked at me. You know her look. And she sighed. Then she told me everyone can know everything Destiny knows. And more than that. She said we all not only could know everything. We do. We just tell ourselves we don't to make it all bearable.-Um. What’s the name of the word for things not being the same always. You know. I’m sure there is one. Isn’t there? There must be a word for it… the thing that lets you know time is happening. Is there a word?- Change.- …I was afraid of that.η άποψη μου για όλη τη σειρά εδώ:https://wordpress64426.wordpress.com/...
