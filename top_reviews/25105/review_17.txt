Delirium, Dream's sister, decides she wants to find her brother who has left his duties and is gone. So she goes around asking her family and eventually lands on Dream, who surprisingly agrees mostly because he's heartbroken his love left him. So together they begin to travel the world trying to find their brother. Going from strip bars, to meeting other gods, to taking a chance against the odds and losing, to crazy driving adventures, and eventually landing on Dream visiting his son and asking him for help. This crazy, zanny, heartbreaking adventure ends in such a way I was expecting yet oddly hit me hard. This is easily my favorite volume. It's packed with plenty of emotional scenes, scenes you can think on for awhile, and some comedy bits that help keep it going. The relationship between Dream and Delirium is near perfect and I couldn't have loved it more. The other family members who pop in all do their duties and when you meet their brother Destruction you really feel a sense that this guy has been through some shit and just wants to live his life, and we can all understand that. This is a deep volume, heavy, took me a few days to read, but I was adsorbed into this world every time I picked it up. The ending with Dream and his son is just...powerful. I loved everything about this volume. A 5 out of 5.
