So, this volume is a single story, opening with Delirium aching for seeing her brother Destruction again, and starts to ask her other endless siblings for their help to retrieve the missing prodigal brother... I don't know what exactly is hooking me to this story, for sure it's not the art as it varies from book to book with the change of artists, like this one is much better than book 6... maybe it's the unexpected tale itself, as in you don't know what will the next chapter bring or what would be the next volume about? The volumes draw selectively on the same roost of main characters in every book with the addition of new ones that are singular for each volume, so  when I start each volume  it is really a new story in continuation of the overarching story, and you don't know where its heading, just relax and enjoy the ride...MiM
