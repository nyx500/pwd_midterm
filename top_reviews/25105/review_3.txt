Re-read 7/5/20:I really feel for Destruction. And no, it's not just the times we live in. I feel for him in a very deep way.After all, there are two sides to every coin. :)Original Review:What is really a road trip is really a helluvalot more than just a roadtrip when Dream and Delirium search for their long lost brother of change, Destruction. Nothing is quite as funny and quirky in these Graphic Novels like Delirium, and nobody is quite as quietly disturbing, deep down. How does one need to so completely retreat from Delight by willingly throwing oneself into deepest madness? *shiver*I really loved this volume. Things change.The other most memorable and thought-provoking stories are those of Ishtar and Bast and Orpheus, but honestly, I can't bring myself to pick which I liked the most. They all resonate deeply. :)This is the Sandman I remember decades later, and it holds up as endlessly now as it did the first time I read it. :)
