Dream finally gets to star in his own story. There's are so many great things about this volume. Delirium and Dream's road trip. Destruction and Barnabus. I love their friendship. We get to visit all of the Endless one by one. Even though Death only makes a cameo, she gets the best line, one that still sticks with me almost 30 years later:“You lived what anybody gets, Bernie. You got a lifetime. No more. No less”-Death
