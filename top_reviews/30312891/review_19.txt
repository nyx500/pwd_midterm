im sorry who the hell ends a book like that?? stomps on my heart makes me cry and then RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHIT STORM just ENDS. did cassandra clare not attend kindergarten?? everyone knows that to write a story you need a beginning, middle and end- a rising action, climax and resolution. SO WHERE WAS THE FUCKING RESOLUTION??? somebody please direct me on where to find the ten missing chapters at the end of this book.and the rest of the book?? fuckedy fuck fuck fuckedy fuck fuck over the cliff i gooooo like COME ON. it was something after something going wrong. there was no rest in this book. no relax period. just a constant state of anxiety. like i was balancing at the end of a cliff, teetering over the edge so close to falling. and the last chapter? cassie really just fucking SHOVED me off the cliff. free falling into the dark abyss. i will not recover from this book.anyway, in conclusion, i obviously loved it.
