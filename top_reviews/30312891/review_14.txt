“When a decision is made by the government it emboldens those who are already prejudiced to speak their deepest thoughts of hate. They assume they are simply brave enough to say what everyone really thinks.”

This book did not come to play. (Also I'm boosting this back up to a five because I don't give a shit)

I will actually admit that, sadly, I did not like Emma and Julian’s dynamic… quite as much in this book. I think the tension between them read,, just a little dragged out in the wrong ways? I think this tension actually would have felt more interesting had Emma come close to confessing her feelings in book one, but not actually done so. Here, I just felt like the arc of their dynamic from book one was simply being repeated.I’m really into three-act structure, so here’s my recommendation: some kind of release of tension for them at the end of the first act (in the actual book, this would be when they’re in faerie); they actually get together for the first time at the end of the second act (this does occur in the actual book, but their motivations up until then feel, idk, muddied?) And the entire decision Julian and Emma make about the Clave just seems… I don’t know. SPOILER: I don’t think the authorial decision for them to actually confess particularly works.But ah well. I mean, it's fine. I like them both too much as characters to have any reaction but ://////// sadness :///////

This is still my favorite dynamic of this series and I’m actually incredibly happy it got so much pagetime and uhhhhh buildup we'll go with that. I cried again because I'm me and this makes me so so fucking sad. The Reveals And The Explanations As To A Certain Character's Motivations Had Such Energy And Power I Am Shook. The only (well) love triangle I’ve ever supported or stanned and I would really really like my wishes & hopes & dreams to be validated when they all get together in book three !!!!!!!!

“I never realized how much you can take from someone by not allowing them the words they need to describe themselves. How can you know that there are other people like you when you’ve never had a name to call yourself?”
