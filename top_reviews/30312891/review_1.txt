Don't talk to me for like a week. In other news, I broke my promise again of not reading the book the day it comes out and in one sitting.------------------Why I always do this to myself?I always read the book the day they come out and in one sitting and I don't think about the consequences like how I have to wait another whole f*cking year again.This book is going to make me suffer. I know it. Like Clockwork Prince.I think I better wait until the last book comes out to read the whole series completely without suffering cliffhangers for a year again.
