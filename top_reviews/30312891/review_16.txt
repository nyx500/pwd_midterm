BUDDY READING with my Julian aka CaitlinI want to die. Everything hurts. I can't breathe. The world is over and I have to wait two years. My soul burns. I honestly didn't expect this. This book is a blessing and my hell. Someone save me. Cassandra Clare is my queen and has quite literally ripped my heart out of my body and stomped all over it. My lactose intolerance doesn't agree with this book either; I ate two blocks of chocolate stressing out and now I'm banning myself from buying chocolate because boy do I want to cry some more. It's been like nine hours and I'm still crying. H E L P. This was truly better than Lady Midnight and I never thought I'd say that. Now someone hold me for the next two years. UPDATE 14/05/17: PEOPLE ARE GETTING ARCS AND IM LAYING ON MY BATHROOM FLOOR CRYING BECAUSE LIFE ISNT FAIR AND I NEED THIS BOOK MORE THAN I NEED A BURRITO (aka very badly) EDIT: so many people are salty about this cover but guys anything trumps the original TMI covers - especially the first where it's just a chest. So, we've come a long way.THE COVER HAS BEEN RELEASED. I AM SHOOK. I CAN'T. I LOVE IT.  However, one question:Why is the London bridge in it?!DOES THIS SIGNIFY MORE JEM AND TESSA?! OMG. MAY CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH. I am literal trash for the Shadowhunter series.
