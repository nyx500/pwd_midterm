Calliope was my favorite!For the past 17 years, Linus Baker has been living a quiet life as a caseworker. He visits orphanages that are homes for children who are magical creatures. However, Linus is assigned to a top-secret mission: to inspect an orphanage for five very special magical creatures and their leader, Arthur. What will Linus discover?First of all, the cover to this book is simply phenomenal! I have heard many people describe this book as a hug. And I did find it enjoyable and adorable. The cat, Calliope, was my favorite character (Is anyone really surprised by that?). This book was also unique and magical, and the fantasy wasn’t confusing or difficult to imagine. The characters were distinct enough that I was able to keep try of all of them.That being said, this book seemed a little preachy and long-winded at times. “Don’t you wish you were here?” was mentioned ten times. It would have been more poignant if it wasn’t referenced so many times. Overall, a very enjoyable read. 2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones’s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta
