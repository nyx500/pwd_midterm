If you were to ask me how I’m feeling today, I’ll tell you I’m feeling pretty fuckin’ perfect. This book was unbelievably hyped. There are some hyped books you get, and an instinctual feeling sets in and you know that it’s deserved. Not just deserved: there’s something about it that sets it apart from others. I knew my soul needed this book. And it’s not that themes discussed were anything new. Or all happy for that matter. But they made for great reminders and they made you feel content. The author put his own spin on it, his own language. And then us readers find it and it makes every struggle you’re going through just that much more manageable. Your heart breathes better for it. It might possibly be even worth it?
“I don’t know why you can’t see it.” “See what?” “You. Everything you are.”
For those that want to feel seen, heard, understood and belong somewhere, this book is for you.
