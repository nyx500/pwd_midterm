Check out my YouTube channel where I show my instant reactions upon finishing reading fantasy books.
A delightfully pleasant cozy fantasy book that will leave you smiling from beginning to end.This book was not written for someone like me. I like huge, epic fantasy - and the darker and bloodier the most I will usually like it. So read a "cute", low stakes fantasy is just so contrary to what my tastes are.But I actually had a good time reading this, and it actually served as a good palate cleaner between the more dense books than I am used to. While no part of this book "wowed" me, I just constant had a smile on my face while reading and was engrossed in finding out what would happen here with the plot - even though it's extremely obvious from the beginning. The characters are the stars here, and are just so easy to fall in love with. Each of them is well developed and goes through nice character growth in a short amount of pages.I'm going to keep this review short since seemingly everyone has read this book before and I'm no adding anything new to the discussion here, but I would recommend this to any fantasy fan who is alright with reading something slower and "cuter" than the traditional fantasy book.
