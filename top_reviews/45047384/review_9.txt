i have actively avoided this book. even with all the hype its gotten over the past year and half, the story just didnt interest me in the slightest. but then i read TJKs ‘under the whispering door’ and it broke me. so here i am. hoping to have a similar experience. and i did. gosh, there are so many little nuggets of wisdom and truth embedded in this. there are also moments of pure happiness and love. like this adorable gem:
��youre too precious to put into words. i think… its like one of theodores buttons. if you asked him why he cared about them so, he would tell you its because they exist at all.’
i cant really add much to the thousands of reviews that have already been posted for this book. but for me, personally, this story is wonderfully life-affirming and gives me the hope in humanity that i desperately need.↠ 5 stars
