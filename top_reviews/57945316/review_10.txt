i read this 100% because it seems badass.and guess what! it was! i get everything i want in this life and i always will.this had translation! literature! school! the evils of colonialism! what more could you want!besides a swift end to my liberal and uncharacteristic use of exclamation points, as if i am writing an email uncomfortably! unfortunately that won't be happening, because i am too enthusiastic!i don't know why this book has been getting bizarre and specific negative reviews, because i thought it was pretty damn good!not perfect — very YA feeling at points, and very slow at others — but effective and cool!bottom line: !!!
