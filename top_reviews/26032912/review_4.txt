bad news: found out i DO NOT have the power to manifest dreams into reality.good news: even though my ending is definitely better, i am wholly content with how this ends. ________________________________i had a dream last night that i snuck into the little brown publishing office, stole a copy of this, and read the final scene. it was taryns funeral, with carden and jude laughing wickedly together in dark love over her casket.never in my life have i wanted to manifest something into existence so much.â†  4.5 stars
