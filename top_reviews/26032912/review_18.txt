“Mortals are fragile,’ I say. ‘Not you,’ he says in a way that sounds a little like a lament. ‘You never break.”⚠DO NOT continue if you HAVE NOT read book one (The Cruel Prince) and book two(The Wicked King) ⚠Jude, the High Queen of faerie has been exiled by her busband Carden Greenbriar. Her father Madoc is still set on claiming the throne for himself through means of war and Jude is beyond frustrated with her uselessness of being stuck in the mortal world. But when an opportunity to sneak back into Faerie under guise presents itself, Jude grabs it with both hands. Things don't go according to plan and Jude finds herself once again surrounded by enemies. 
“I am the Queen of Elfhame. Even though I am the queen in exile, I am still the queen. And that means Madoc isn’t just trying to take Cardan’s throne. He’s trying to take mine.”
 I thoroughly enjoyed The Cruel Prince and The Wicked King and like many, I have been anticipating this book's release for months. This book, unfortunately, just didn't have the ‘wow factor’ that it's predecessors had. And the entire time I was holding my breath waiting to be blindsided — it didn't come. Though I am disappointed with this finale, Queen of Nothing still had that easy writing that Holly is known for. Writing that you can't help but getting sucked into. I adored the epilogue and I will be very upset if this is the last we get set in this world from Holly Black. I'd even take a novella. Just give us something! « Thank you to the publishers for gifting me this copy in exchange for an honest review »______
