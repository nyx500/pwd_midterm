I am not, contrary to the belief of many, a cold, heartless rock. Though sometimes I feel like one. To support my claim, I present to you my notes page, in its entirety. "It's you I love," he says. "I spent much of my life guarding my heart. I guarded it so well that I could behave as though I didn't have one at all. Even now, it is a shabby, worm-eaten, and scabrous thing. But it is yours."That's it. Those are my notes. You see? I'm capable of shipping a romance without tearing it into pieces smaller than my heart a rowan berry! Only two characters can lie in this book, and yet the number of betrayals and the amount of treachery that goes on is staggering. And I love it. This is court politics at its finest, balanced with action and romance and character development and BANTER. Yes. Authors, take note. The dynamic between Cardan and Jude is perfection. 
My sweet nemesis, how glad I am that you returned.
 They were enemies to start with, and then sort-of friends but mostly allies, and then MARRIED, and I--Proof I can actually feel emotions. *screaming* Anyway. This was supposed to be a review, but my heart isn't cooperating. Curse you, emotions. Maybe it was easier being ✨heartless.✨⬆️ my heart right now6 stars (Goodreads needs to get a better rating system)
