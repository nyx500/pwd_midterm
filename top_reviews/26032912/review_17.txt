"For what we want most, we will take almost any chance."
Let me preface this by saying I've always been honest in my reviews and I'm not about to start sugar-coating things now. So, if you loved this book and are willing to down fighting tooth and nail over it, do you. You're entitled to your opinions and they're totally valid since we all have different reading experiences. If you loved this book, I'm happy for you but this just wasn't for me. And it's not that it was bad, I mean, I devoured it in one day. But basically on every single level this book did not live up to my expectations which was something I worried was going to happen.  To put it simply this was underwhelming AF and instead of writing some nice cohesive review let's just break it down, shall we?What I Liked👸🏻 Jude. Jude is basically the one thing in this book that felt the most authentic from start to finish. I think out of everyone in the book her character development was the best. And I will always appreciate how badass she is and the fact that she basically takes what she wants out of life, no questions asked.🌎 The worlds. I really liked that there was more of a clash of Faerie and the mortal world in this book. It added a nice element to the story imagining some of the fae characters doing things like eating pizza or learning what gummy worms were and left a nice lighthearted touch to the story. I also loved being back in Faerie. This fae world is without a doubt my favorite and I'll always love how Holly Black is basically the master of creating all things faerie. The TRUEE Queen of Faerie.👵🏻 Grima Mog. The MVP of the story. Don't even try and change my mind.What I Didn't Like🧚🏻‍♂️ Cardan. Let's start with my first biggest issue with the book, and that's Cardan. Now, I know that obviously a hate to love story is not going to stay on the "hate" side forever. I get that. However, what I was not expecting is to have two books filled with so much hate and then book three Cardan turns around and is just all mushy, gooey, head over in heels "I'll die without Jude by my side". Like what?! Meanwhile homeboy would have killed her with a smile on his face during the last two books. Where is the growth? Don't just expect us to believe it. SHOW US. Show us how much pain Cardan was in while Jude was in exile IN. THE. STORY...not in the Barnes and Noble exclusive edition all the way at the end that most reader's won't get to experience!!! Honestly, I'm low-key heated about this whole thing. When I read the letters in the back of my book I could not believe that they were not included in the story. That was such a bad move since those letters would have given Cardan just an ounce of decent character development.📈 Pacing. The beginning of this book didn't necessarily drag, but it also didn't do anything for me either. With the first two books if anyone even looked at me while I was trying to read they would have gotten screamed at, however, with this one once I hit chapter five I was like "alright nothing's happening let me take a break." Things eventually did start to pick up once you hit part two but that's halfway through the story. At that point I was shitting bricks thinking there was no possible way everything was going to be resolved in the next 150 pages. Much to my surprise it was, but it was mediocre as hell.⚔️ Battle Scene. Where was it? Because I'm still waiting. I legitimately cannot believe Jude got strapped for battle and then it just literally lasted like 2.5 pages...maybe less. It was so anticlimactic and predictable that I had to laugh. Where are the twists and turns books one and two delivered?! Why was there nothing that shocked me in this book?Holly Black's plot twists usually take my breath away and it was all just so predictable and underwhelming. 🔚 The end. In terms of wrapping up the series it was pretty weak and again super underwhelming. After the whole battle scene I knew that any hope of a truly good wrap up was out the window.All in all, this was definitely the weakest out of all three books for me, but I don't think three stars is a bad rating. It's average and that's exactly what this book was for me. The Wicked King will always be my favorite and I'm perfectly fine with having the first two books be basically perfection. So, am I sad to see these characters go? After this book not really. But would I read more books written in the Faerie world? Absolutely.Blog | Twitter
