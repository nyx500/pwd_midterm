“There are some lessons that must be written in scars.”
After loving Red Sister with all my heart, I was prepared to spend two more books seeing all the characters I fell for going through classes and surviving the occasional battle, but Mark Lawrence had other plans for them. Grey Sister took a completely different turn that left me speechless, worried nothing was going to be the same again. I was kinda right, because it was so much better. Everything was new, exciting, surprising. I didn’t know what was going to happen next, didn’t know what they should do, who was going to survive and it was driving me crazy. The continuation of the scene that was the very start of book one is still keeping me on the edge. The more glimpses we get, the stronger is the need to know more. 
Those novices are my friends and I would die for them. I would face a terror for them that I haven’t the courage to stand against on my own behalf.
I fell in love with all the characters in Red Sister, but seeing them mature as the stakes grow higher and they start to realize they have been playing a bigger game than they thought made my love grow to obsession. PS: it’s great to see LGBT+ rep in adult fantasy books through characters that are not secondary ✨
