Another solid instalment in the Book of The Ancestor series!The first 150 pages of this took me a little while to settle into but after that I was immersed, once again loving the grim atmosphere and tone of Nona's story. Nona herself I still adore, one of my favourite things about this series being how you come to sympathise with and root for her throughout the story. I was however, a tad disappointed that this book unfolds in one part, as my favourite element of Red Sister was the interludes that gave us a glimpse at where our main characters were at a little into the future.While I feel that Grey Sister really expanded the scope of the plot, I feel like we haven't really had any big reveals yet or moments of plot points coming together so I'm looking forward to finding out how the story concludes in Holy Sister!Note - Grey Sister has a recap at the beginning that runs through all the important points from Red Sister if you need a refresh!
