4.25ish stars. I've been reading a lot of good books recently. Makes me want to read a gutter book just so I can skewer it in a review. This is a solid follow-up to Red Sister and is a worthy addition to the series even if it can't match the feeling of surprise that came from experiencing the refreshing novelty and creativity introduced in the first book for the first time. I was unsure about the first half-ish of the book. All of the petty middle school drama - mean, rich girl bully cliques; wretched, crotchety teachers; angsty romance; basically all of the young adult-ness - that Red Sister (thank the Ancestor) managed to circumvent, seemed to rear its ugly head. Thankfully it's balanced by the introduction of a new POV character, Abbess Glass, whose maturity and cunning elevate the story above female-Kvothe school shenanigans. Nona is still Nona, a ruthless, demonic version of Bubbles from Powerpuff Girls. As always, she's surrounded by a strong supporting cast of female characters, including the Abbess, Sister Kettle, Arabella, Darla and Zole, whose increased involvement provide a depth and fullness RS never quite reached. I actually found the Abbess's chapters more engaging as she manipulated her way to the meat of the story while Nona was cavorting about (being hunted, tortured, blah blah, etc.). It ends on a cliffhanger and I'm already ready for the final installment which is why I feel obligated to thank Mark Lawrence for 1) finishing the series before publishing and 2) including a recap section at the beginning of the book. What a gentleman! Finally, I can't emphasize enough how great the audiobook narrated by Heather O'Neill is. I can't imagine experiencing this world without her Irish lilt to guide me.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library
