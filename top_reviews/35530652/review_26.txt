This is the second instalment in the Book of the Ancestor trilogy.Nona Grey is an inhabitant of the Sisters of Sweet Mercy convent, which trains its girls less in prayer and more in the art of death. Her new skills will soon be put to good use as all those outside of the convent walls, as well as a fair few inside it, wish to see Nona suffer for her past crimes and ultimately pay for it with her death.Whilst I adored the first series instalment, which was largely set inside the convent and focused on the training the young girls undertook, this soon widened its focus and provided a larger political and geographical investigation. With this, the laws and magics of this kingdom were further explored and a far more complex story-line emerged.Nona remained as bloody, bad-ass, and beloved as ever, but I also appreciated how other characters were also given their time in the spotlight, meaning I now have a whole band of knife-wielding, magic-possessing, poison-trained, seductively sinister females to fawn over!
