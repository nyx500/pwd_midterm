Even though I’ve had the benefit of knowing what happens in this volume of Outlander by having seen Series 3 the previous year, I still feel that these books are so incredibly well written and structured that any reader can slowly take their time with them and flip between this and other books intermittently.It’s a good job to as this edition had 1,000+ pages and the new few in the series appear even longer!I love where Gabaldon takes her characters in both their life time’s experience and forthcoming locations. Even though the reader is itching for both Claire and Jamie to be reunited, their some nice symmetry in the earlier sections of the book that shows just how perfectly suited the pair are together.The actual voyage itself is some of my favourite parts of the second half of the novel, just like the previous novels the feeling of living in this time period is so delicately detailed that it’s easy to slip through the high page count.I thought the fourth season was even better so am looking forward to tackling Drums of Autumn next!
