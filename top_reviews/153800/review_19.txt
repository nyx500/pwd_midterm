Once again, I was going to give this four stars, but the ending (the last hour or so in the audiobook) pushed it up to five. Really loved seeing Kel come into her own as a knight while still demonstrating her stubborn heroism and courage. I particularly liked the addition of Toby and learning exactly where "protector of the small" comes from. I'll definitely be reading more Tamora Pierce!
