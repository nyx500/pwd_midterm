This was all set up to be a wonderful conclusion. The pacing was quick, Kel has developed into my favorite Tamora Pierce character thus far, and we had easily the most evil villain Tortall has produced thus far for our heroine to vanquish.Everything up until the last few chapters, I really liked. I enjoyed her new command, what she made of it, and how she disobeyed orders to go after captured innocents, disregarding their station as peasant class individuals(Very in keeping with her character as the girl who saved her maid, risking her own advancement of her dream). It's not that I hated the last few chapters, they just felt a bit lame. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't the last book in the series, but I didn't feel it was the thrilling conclusion Kel deserved. Everything wrapped up nice and neat in a couple chapters, and everyone got to live happily ever after. No real sense of suspense or drama, just put the sword(glaive, actually) through the bad guy and ride off into the sunset. I appreciate the complete disregard of the love triangle earlier in the series, and the focus on Kel as an individual coming into adulthood on her own. Kel as a character is the best and most smoothly developed I've read from Tamora Pierce. I think she warranted a better ending.
