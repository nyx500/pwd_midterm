Added 2018: I still think this is largely true! The first Alanna book is just perfect, but as a series this is stronger. There's also a lot of really good stuff about the practical realities of being a woman in command.These are much better than the Alanna series. Better written, really solid on the horrors of war/the problems with the setup of the Tortall universe, and it's interesting to see Pierce go back to Alanna and Jonathan and show that they are imperfect, not necessarily likeable people.
