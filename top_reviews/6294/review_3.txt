I came in expecting a novelization of the movie (one of my favorites), but what I got was even better. Good news: The atmosphere and characterization is extremely similar to the Studio Ghibli film. I absolutely loved practical, stubborn Sophie and vain, dramatic Howl as well as the overall concept of the story. Those were the reasons I wanted to read the book in the first place, and luckily it delivered.The book is simply more. We get more insight into Sophie and Howl's backstories and strong personalities, more time in different worlds, more characters, more factors working against our protagonists, and more explanation of how magic works in this universe. As someone who loves to completely understand fantasy worlds and how they work, I loved it. Since there were so many factors introduced throughout this novel, the ending felt a little rushed. I loved it just the same!The movie is a great movie, and the book was a great book. They are two very different experiences, but work perfectly hand-in-hand. I would recommend it to all fans of the movie and YA fantasy!
