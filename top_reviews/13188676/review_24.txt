if i were to choose who id fuck marry and kill, id fuck kenji, marry warner, and kill adam (its self explanatory really). its usually hard to make me genuinely laugh but kenji's humor had me actually laughing for a full 3 mins he's probably my favorite character ngl,, warner and juliette's relationship warms my heart i internally screamed so many times warner deserves the world :( the first book was a shitshow but i could see the author's improvement as i kept reading and her writing and the plot def got way better.
