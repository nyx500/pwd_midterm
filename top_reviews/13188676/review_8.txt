Reread: I just realized I never wrote a review on goodreads for this book so here we are:5/5 stars this book is my comfort read.Juliette is one of my favorite female mc because of her character development and the way she never gave up and continued to grow and grow and become a stronger person. When you compare Juliette from book one to in this book, you can see a massive change in not only the way she talks and thinks about herself but also because of how she is respected by other people.I relate to a lot of Juliette’s thoughts in book one so I guess she is a very personal character to me and seeing her grow makes my heart warm every single time. Warner is obviously my book boyfriend and I feel like that already says enough but here we go. I really didn’t like Aaron in book one, not the first time nor any other time I have reread it because coming from Juliette’s perspective, he was a horrible person.Now he has always has a lot of respect for Juliette and yet again in this book it just shows how much Aaron really cares for her.The way he starts expressing his feelings towards her make me emotional and honestly jealous because I want someone to talk about me like that.The chemistry between the two also finally explodes in this book and I mean it’s definitely there.You can tell that they are a match made in heaven.Both keep pushing each other to be better:Aaron keeps pushing Juliette to be comfortable in her skin and understand that her power doesn’t make her something evil or something that everyone should hate and Juliette keeps pushing Aaron to be a better person not just to her which works (kinda).You can just tell that their relationship has respect in it and lots of learning and growing together.Kenji is obviously my platonic soulmate so I can’t forget about him. He brings everything to the table okay:He is a loyal friend that will stand up for you in any situation and is your partner in crime. He’s funny and loving and even if he doesn’t have any love life advise he sure does have lots of advice for how you can grow as a character and jump over your shadow.We get a lot more depth for Kenji in this book and find out more about his past and his relationship with everyone else like Castle and Brandon.Him and Juliette have such a great friendship and I find that they have the perfect balance of a teasing and fun but also caring and loyal friendship. We get a lot of other characters that make the entire group grow and we are at the beginning of the forming of a found family trope which is my favorite thing of all times.Now writing wise I do live Tahereh and I still to this day love the crossing out technique she used in her first book and just because she made Juliette a character that I really really like. Plot wise we are getting quite a lot of actions but also ✨drama✨ on love island which we all know is super fun. This book has a lot of tension and the story is written at a good pace and the set up for book four is there. Yet again I think the book had enough tension and enough serious moments to make me never feel bored at all and yes there us a slight love triangle in here but as you will find out pretty quickly, you can’t really choose Adam. Now about Adam. Honestly biggest change in character ever but somehow it all fits together and makes sense especially in correlation to their chemistry.That’s all that’s my take on my comfort book and yeah BEST LOVE CONFESSION ON THIS PLANET IN HERE LIKE WOW AARON KNOWS HIS WAY WITH WORDS Had to reread yet again
