“Ignite, my love. Ignite.”
Literally sobbing. I saw a candle on Etsy called "Ignite My Love. Ignite." I'm going to buy it. I also saw a Warner candle and yes. I'm going to get that one too. I have no words. Zero. Zip. Nada. This was my favorite so far, OBVIOUSLY, and WOW. I am going to have SO MUCH FUN writing this review. Ok, so let's start with the PLOT. Wild. Fantastic. Made my heart pound. Gave me chills. Literally in the first chapters we got plot twist after plot twist, and I was so confused, because SO MUCH STUFF WAS JUST BEING ADMITTED and I was freaking out! But a lot happened, with Juliette reeling from what happened in Unravel Me, and she didn't know if her friends were all dead and all that jazz. But just wow, I'm so hyped for the next books. (let's not talk about how I forgot everything that happens in Unravel Me except for a Warnette kiss heheh...)And there's the WRITING.There are some incredibly good quotes in this book, and I love how the writing subsides with the metaphors because Juliette isn't entirely crazy anymore. I wish I could create amazing quotes like these 🥲EXAMPLES:“It's the kind of kiss that inspires stars to climb into the sky and light up the world.”“Words, I think, are such unpredictable creatures.No gun, no sword, no army or king will ever be more powerful than a sentence. Swords may cut and kill, but words will stab and stay, burying themselves in our bones to become corpses we carry into the future, all the time digging and failing to rip their skeletons from our flesh.”“And we are quotation marks, inverted and upside down, clinging to one another at the end of this life sentence. Trapped by lives we did not choose.”And who could forget:“Lift your hips for me, love.”I was a giggling monster after and during that scene, no joke. But more on THAT later.AND THEN. THE CHARACTERS.And since first is the worst, we start off with:ADAM KENTI hope he dies. By being pushed off a cliff. And I'm the one who pushed him off a cliff. Because he is the worst. I may have hated him for no reason in the first books except that my love for Warner came with a hatred for Adam, but oh boy do I have many reasons to hate him now.1. He's so possessive over Juliette. In Unravel Me, they end their relationship, and Adam still believes that they're in a "relationship" because they "still loved each other" when they broke up. Move on2. He tried to make Juliette feel guilty about what happened at the end of Unravel Me, when it wasn't even her fault. I think. I remember nothing about Unravel Me, so don't take my word for it. 3. HE'D RATHER SHE DIED THAN GO TO WARNER. LIKE WTF?????4. HE MADE JULIETTE AND KENJI TOUCH. NOT ENOUGH TO KILL KENJI, BUT BRO. YOU DON'T DO THAT.There are probably many more I cannot remember. But anyways, that felt freeing to rant about, and I still hope Adam dies. “You want to be with him?” He points to the door. “Go. Drop dead.”Excuse me while I go-KENJI KISHIMOTOI love him so much. He would make an INCREDIBLE best friend. I envy Juliette more and more (mainly because of Warner, but because of Kenji too). And he is hilarious. Just look:Let's set the scene: Warner's working out and Juliette is trying not to be attracted to him (impossible)Kenji: "So this is what gets you going, huh?"Juliette: "I've never seen him in shorts."Kenji: "I bet you've seen him in a lot less."PERFECTION. (this scene made me die)“I'm not falling for Warner,” I say quietly.“Sure you aren't.”“I'm not," I insist. “I'm just-I don't know.” I sigh. “I don't know what's happening to me.”“They're called hormones.”BRILLIANT.Anyways, Kenji is just perfect. I can't wait till he meets Nazeera, (I haven't met her yet, but because this series is everywhere, I know she comes in later) he deserves everything. JULIETTE FERRARSShe has grown SO MUCH. When Warner calls her out for her overdramatics and pettiness, she realizes her mistakes, and she really grows with them. And when Juliette was addressing the crowd near the end, I got chills, literal chills. She's just such a solid character, and I can't wait to see how she progresses and grows even MORE throughout the next three books. “I can do anything I want.Be with anyone I want.And it'll be my choice.”AND THE PERSON WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR: AARON WARNER ANDERSONGod, the choke hold Warner has on me. He's so much better than Adam. He's supportive of Juliette, he loves her and cares for her SO MUCH. And we learn how he's not that terrible, though I've believed in him from the beginning. And he's a fashionista, like what else could you want? AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON HIS LINES-“Ignite, my love. Ignite.”I'm repeating this quote because it is literal perfection.“It's not charity,” I snap. “He cares about me-and I care about him!”Warner nods, unimpressed. “You should get a dog, love. I hear they share much the same qualities.”Wonderful description of Adam. And here's another amazing description for Adam by Warner: “Bland, utterly replaceable automaton.”Chef's kiss. Anywho, Warner is my favorite person ever and I wish he would marry me. But alas. That is impossible. And now I'm sad. WARNETTE“Come back to life, love. I'll be here when you wake up.”QOEGWEGERIEROHEORHERMHThey are so incredible together, omg. AND THEIR FANART, OMG. They have some of the best fanart I have ever seen, like what. It's unfair. And chapter 55- famous for the line "lift your hips for me, love" and it DELIVERED. I was such a mess during Warnette scenes, like in the beginning they were crackling with so much tension, and then when they finally kissed, I was a puddle. Also, those kisses were hot. Like the "lift your hips for me, love" one was hot, but the second one?? ANYWAYS, as I expected, this was really fun to write. I loved this and I am growing to really love this series, and the characters are becoming some of my favorites. 4.5 stars H e l l i s e m p t ya n d a l l t h e d e v i l s a r e h e r e
