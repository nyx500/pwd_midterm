“i want you to make a list of all of your favorite things, and i want to be on it.”

“the perfect book doesn’t exi-“ WRONG the perfect book does exist and it’s this book RIGHT HERE— i honestly can’t put into words how i felt while reading this bc i’m just overwhelmed with all these emotions rn, like it was a full on roller coaster. i’m going to need at least 5 business days to process this book.okay, so hear me out,
CHAPTER 55
— juliette’s growth from the first book to now is PHENOMENAL. from being this shy timid girl to a whole girl boss who doesn’t take shit from anyone anymore, YOU LOVE TO SEE IT. i loved watching her gain more confidence and finally become her own person. she knows who she is and what she wants and is ready to take charge and rule the nation. she finally stands up for herself, more specifically to *cough* ew adam.i was fully invested in her friendship with kenji—their banter is EVERYTHING, my fav comedic duo 🫶🏼kenji is carrying this whole series on his mf back— warner, *sighs dreamily* idk how it’s possible to love him more than i already do. i’m literally on my knees for him. pick me, choose me, love me. i would do anything for aaron warner!! he needs a dog? i can bark. he could run me over with his car and i would drop to my knees, kiss his hands and beg for his forgiveness.

”you can have anything of mine you want. you can have all of it.”

kicking my legs n shit—sir i want YOU.

”lift your hips for me, love”

WHY ARE MY LEGS WIDE OPEN— his name who shall not be spoken is a certified douche and i just kept hoping he would, excuse me, ✨drop dead✨ just when you thought his character could not get any worse, BAM he gets 100 times worse. this man is just big ball of possessive rage that needs to seek help. the urge to just punch him in the face.as aaron warner says he is "some bland, utterly replaceable automaton."no thoughts, head empty. just the pager scene.
NOTHING
WILL EVER TOP THIS SCENE, THIS IS GOD TIER PEAK ROMANCE. WHEN I TELL YOU I WAS LOSING MY MIND, NOW JUST IMAGINE IF WE GOT IT IN WARNER’S POV!! i’m having a breakdown while writing this, that scene is the apex of literature.
