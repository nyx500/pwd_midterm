"Ignite, my love. Ignite."I get it. I FINALLY GET THE HYPE of this series and the amazing characters in this. From the book 2 in the series I knew it will become one of my favourites. This is a freaking masterpiece for me and I definitely want more of this series and more of Aaron, Kenji and Julliete. There is romance, drama, tension, war, love, friendship, freedom, found family thing, character development and so much in this one and I ate that shit up. This book is an utter perfection. There were so many parts in this which had me gasping, screaming and giggling and it was all worth it. One of my most favourite scenes from this book was when Kenji and Julliete spend the night at the terrace and talked about everything from friendship to lost dreams and it was just beautiful. The other one was when Julliete confessed her love for Aaron 😭💗 well that scene was hot as hell and it was exquisite. 
"Lift your hips for me, love."
 Iconic 🛐God please just give me a best friend like Kenji and a lover like Aaron Warner. I swear I can die for these two because how can I not !? Kenji and Aaron are everything😭😭💗The world building and everything was perfectly laid out and the cliffhanger in the end...umm yeah I definitely have to read it to know what the hell happened after Julliete killed Anderson and how the hell are they going to take over everything. Well this is gonna be so much interesting now 😩🔥I loved Kenji and Julliete's friendship and how they both helped each other and how they stood for each other. Which was just beautiful because they both deserve each other in every aspect. Aaron and Julliete are love 😭💗 Aaron and Julliete both become friends in this one. I just love them so much and they are Soulmates for sure.I also loved the fact there is character development wether its Kenji or Aaron especially Aaron Warner and Julliete but hell not Adam. His character just sucks and he was portrayed like this asshole ex boyfriend who just can't get over the fact that Julliete left him for the boy he considered his enemy and he fucking said these stupid and infuriating things to Julliete like I just wanted to punch him in the face and then kick his face because Adam and his mouth were just so fucking irritating in this book. And I can't wait for Winston and Brendan to be a thing I mean they are sometimes so cute and adorable together and they need to be a couple in the next book. The story basically started after the Omega Point had been destroyed by Anderson and Julliete was shot by Anderson but Aaron somehow saved her. She thought that her friends died and she didn't wanted to let Anderson destroy other things and kill other people so she decided to kill him. But she wasn't enough to make this plan work but then she somehow met Kenji who led her to their other friends who were still very much alive. And they all together fought to destroy The Reestablishment and to kill Anderson.The writing in this book was poetic, riveting, eloquent and amusing. I mean the way Tahereh Mafi writes her books is something very enchanting ✨️ and I just can't help but fall in love with her writing pattern and characters. She describes everything so beautifully whether its world building or her character's inner thoughts or the scenes where characters are getting intimate. There may be long narrations sometimes and many inner dialogues but I just can't help but love everything. Aaron WarnerThis man is everything and so much perfect even with his flaws and the things he did. I have always been intrigued by his character from the very first book but in this I am so much deeply in love with him and the way he loves Julliete and would do anything for her. And that "PAGER SCENE" God the way I screamed at that part 😭😩 This man even has a soft spot for fashion. Oh. God. He's always so vulnerable when he is with Julliete but he finally told her about why he did those things to her and how he fell in love with her. He shared everything with her his past and his future and his most feared thoughts and Julliete accepted him the way he was and never wanted to change him. He thinks he is a monster and I will kill those who made him felt like that. He had been through hell and what happened to his mother was really heartbreaking. He didn't deserve this cruel world. But thank god he found his happiness in this book with Julliete and James. I loved Aaron and James interactions even though they were about random things. And most importantly AARON WARNER BLUSHED in this book 😭💗💗 he really can be sweet and adorable when he wants to..
"In a world where there is so much to grieve and so little good to take? I grieve nothing. I take everything."
Julliete FerrarsThe "touch him and you die" girl. I loved how she went from this timid little girl who hated herself because of her lethal touch to this powerful and brave girl who knows what she wants from her life and who is ready to take over The Reestablishment. Although the transition felt a bit rushed for me but I think that's okay atleast for me. She is so much confident and strong now and is leading a rebellion. She finally mastered her powers and I am so proud of her. I am also glad she took her time to accept her feelings for Aaron because she loves him and not because he was the only one who can endure her touch. It made their realtionship more stronger and mature. I loved her inner dialogues so much and the way there were so many things in this book that symbolises her growth. 
"I am no longer afraid of fear, and I will not let it rule me. Fear will learn to fear me."
Kenji KishomotoIf you have a friend like him irl you are winning in life. He is the best character in this book. He is so selfless, caring and sweet and I just can't but want to hug him so badly right now and tell him that "Kenji you are the absolute best and my forever favourite". He's always ready to help his friends and hides his own emotions from others because he didn't want to cause them pain. He turns everything into a joke and it hurted me a lot when he said that he is as much broken as others and tired of living like that. He has such a pure soul and he can do no wrong in my eyes. I am glad that he has Julliete as his best friend and he can now atleast share his thoughts with her. Their interactions were just so wholesome, adorable and heartwarming 😭😭✨️ and I also loved their banter and Kenji's weird references 😆 "For me Kenji and Julliete are the definition of Platonic Soulmates."
"You'll fight with me?" I ask him, hardly breathing. "Fight back with me? Even if it's with Warner?"Kenji smiles. Looks up at the sky. "Hell yeah," he says. "Really?""I'm here for you, kid. That's what friends are for."
The ending had me gasping and screaming and I loved every bit of it. Well I thought it would be a massive war but things happened very quickly in the end. But the cliffhanger arghhh I just can't wait to start the next and see how Julliete and Aaron are gonna takeover The Reestablishment. I know it's gonna be freaking amazing. —Favourite Quotes—➸ "And we are quotation marks, inverted and upside down, clinging to one another at the end of this life sentence. Trapped by lives we did not choose."➸ "Words, I think, are such unpredictable creatures. No gun, no sword, no army or king will ever be more powerful than a sentence. Swords may cut and kill, but words will stab and stay, burying themselves in our bones to become corpses we carry into the future, all the time digging and failing to rip."➸ "I like the way I feel about myself when I'm with him." I say quietly. "Warner thinks I'm strong and smart and capable and he actually values my opinion. He makes me feel like his equal--like I can accomplish just as much as he can, and more. And if I do something incredible, he's not even surprised. He expects it. He doesn't treat me like I'm some fragile little girl who needs to be protected all the time."➸ "He and I would end up like water going nowhere. Water that never moves-- It's fine for a little while. You can drink from it and it'll sustain you. But if it sits too long it goes bad. It grows stale. It becomes toxic. I need waves. I need waterfalls. I want rushing currents."➸ "I’m not sure. But there’s something about the darkness, the stillness of this hour, I think, that creates a language of its own. There’s a strange kind of freedom in the dark; a terrifying vulnerability we allow ourselves at exactly the wrong moment, tricked by the darkness into thinking it will keep our secrets. We forget that the blackness is not a blanket; we forget that the sun will soon rise. But in the moment, at least, we feel brave enough to say things we’d never say in the light."➸ "You’re perfect,” I tell him, so overcome I forget myself. “All of you. Your entire body. Proportionally. Symmetrically. You’re absurdly, mathematically perfect. It doesn’t even make sense that a person could look like you,"➸ "You are magnificent. You are extraordinary."➸ "It's the kind of kiss that inspires stars to climb into the sky and light up the world. The kind that takes forever and no time at all."➸ "I promise myself then, in that moment, that I will hold him forever, just like this, until all the pain and torture and suffering is gone, until he's given a chance to live the kind of life where no one can wound him this deeply ever again."➸ "Juliette,” he says.“Yes?”“Thank you,” he whispers. “For being my friend.” I turn around then. “I will always be here if you need me,” I say, the darkness catching and hushing my voice. “Please remember that. Always remember that."So far I am loving this series so much and I can't wait to unravel other things in the next books. Hope they are as good as this one. Ignite Me is the best one for me in this series and I know I'll be a sobbing mess once I finished reading all the books. I don't know what you all are doing right now just go and read this amazing series!!!!
