I can’t think of a single pirate or sea faring adventure story that centers a female pirate in her 40s. And not only is Amina revered, she is feared. And for good reason. The rumors surrounding her and her crew are infamous, and she refuses to back down.Amina finds herself coming out of retirement for the ultimate heist, which will ensure that she can provide her daughter Marjana with everything that she needs in life…BUT the stakes are sky high and of course nothing is as it seems once Amina sets sail. I loved every minute of this book. There’s so many wild adventures and utter shenanigans, but watching Amina with her old trusted friends (Dalila, Tinbu, and Majed) was a reminder that no matter how old you are and what you’ve been through, your day ones will stick by your side.There’s also some really incredible magic and creatures in this book. They took me by surprise, and I found myself utterly enchanted by this immersive tale! I can’t wait to see what’s next! Lastly, I listened to the audio while reading along, which I HIGHLY recommend because the narrator is amazing! Thank you to Harper Voyager and Harper Audio for providing a review copy! This did not influence my review. All opinions are my own.
