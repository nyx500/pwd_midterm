What fun this was! My quibbles here are that I wish we'd had a little more character development and the pacing dragged a bit at times, but otherwise, I loved the authorial voice, the world building, and the romping plot. This is the first in a series that I see myself continuing on when it's all out and I can binge it in one big, delightful gulp. Definitely lives up the pre-pub hype
