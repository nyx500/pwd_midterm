4.5 stars rounded upA very promising start to a historical fantasy series! the Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi draws on the real history of the Middle East and follows a notorious female captain and smuggler who is now a middle-aged mother trying to keep her daughter safe. But fate forces her back to sea in search of a missing young woman. And of course there are monsters, supernatural beings, an evil sorcerer, and magical artifacts! Not to mention the reappearance of the husband Amina hoped was dead. A husband who isn't human and doesn't know about their daughter... Amina is a great character- she is brash and irreverent, but also a mother doing her best to keep her daughter safe and coming to terms with how that new piece of her identity has changed her priorities. And she's trying to be a better Muslim as well. With mixed success. I'm loving this mini-trend of writing older women and mothers as main characters in fantasy novels. It's an entertaining adventure that infuses a lot of real historical detail, plus we get a trans side character and I liked how it handled the issue of gender identity. (note that I'm not trans myself, so I will be looking to hear from trans reviewers on this)There were parts of the book that dragged a little for me, and I think this is a bit more plot driven than what I prefer and more of a character reader. But overall I really enjoyed this and love the ship-board family Amina has cobbled together. I will certainly read on in the series. The audiobook is mostly quite good, also there are a handful of asides that are recorded in a way that makes them muffled and hard to hear. I think this was an artistic choice, but it could have been done better. I received an audio review copy of this book via NetGalley, all opinions are my own.
