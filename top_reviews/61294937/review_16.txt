i’m usually fine with not understanding what’s not going on but because i didn’t understand the language it made it even harder, half the words i needed help with weren’t even in the glossary. in fact the glossary only had 9 words. i thought the premise was interesting and the characters were funny but idk i just spent more time trying to figure out what they were saying and maybe that’s my own ignoranceedit: i edited changed my rating of the book and i don’t want people to think i gave the book a low rating because i didn’t understand the language. originally i gave the book 3 stars but after sitting on my opinions of the book for a few months i realized the book isn’t memorable and decided to change my review lower because of that. sorry if you enjoyed this book but we all have different opinions and that’s ok!
