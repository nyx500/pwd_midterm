Cover: 🌟🌟🌟 (Design with blue and black background)
The mystical patterns and illustrations in this design nicely allude to the magical and oceanic elements of the story. However, I prefer the alternate cover with a ship and sea creature as this is more striking and provides stronger hints of the story's premise.
Writing: 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Amina's sassy narrative quickly grabbed my attention, and I loved the humour this brought to the story. I was also pulled in by the fascinating world, with its rich mythology, culture, history and religion. While this world-building is presented in information dumps, these were easy to follow and strengthened by vivid descriptions which brought the world to life.“There is no living thing that doesn’t desire freedom.”
Storyline: 🌟🌟🌟
Despite an intriguing introduction to the world and protagonist, I soon struggled to remain invested in unfolding events as the story's pacing and tension gradually waned. Still, Amina's quest is filled with constant action and danger as there are jailbreaks, cons, dangerous creatures, treasure hunting, explosions, dark magic, and so much more, providing many moments of entertainment. I also enjoyed the feminist theme woven into the storyline through Amina's character and experiences since these add some depth to the story.
Main character(s): 🌟🌟🌟🌟
As an older protagonist with different facets - mother, wife, pirate and captain - Amina Al-Sirafi is a compelling and complex character. More than this, Amina's fierce, sassy, and accepting personality made her character easy to love. Although she also experiences some growth as she reaches a resolution about chasing her dreams and being a good mother, I found the inner conflicts she works through to get there repetitive.“to be a woman is to have your story misremembered. Discarded. Twisted."
Secondary characters: 🌟🌟🌟
The story is littered with numerous secondary characters who are gradually introduced but are given little depth beyond their assigned roles. Even so, I loved the diversity of the characters and the witty banter between Amina and her friends.
Narration & Audio: 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Lameece Issaq and Amin El Gamal create an impressive listening experience that perfectly conveys the sass and personalities of the characters. I also loved the creative effect used for Amina's interactions with the scribe! However, since the story contains so much information and background, it was hard to find the narration engaging in these moments.With its intriguing start and compelling protagonist, I really wanted to love 'The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi.' Sadly, while the storyline has multiple elements that should make it a delightful read, I struggled with the pacing and slowly lost interest in the quest. Those who loved this should check out The Eyes of Tamburah by Maria V. Snyder for another entertaining adventure with a fascinating world.
