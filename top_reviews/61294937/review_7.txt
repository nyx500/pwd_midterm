A swashbuckling, charming, high-seas adventure with lady pirates, poisoners, magic, demon husbands, and a host of loveable characters. If you are looking for some good old-fashioned fantasy reading but set in a wonderfully fresh and unique world, this is the ticket. I know Chakraborty also meticulously researched this book (as she says in the acknowledgments) but honestly, that's just an added delight. It's the characters that shine for me, and the fun plot, and the spot on and often hilarious voice of the main character. A true joy.
