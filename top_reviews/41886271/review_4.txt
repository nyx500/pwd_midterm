Woot!! Holy shit!!!!!!!!! I can’t!!!! I’m having a damn panic attack I’m so hyped up on this damn book!! Someone run over and buy me the paperback!! This is going on my shelf, I don’t just want the kindle. I’m getting it in July!!! And I missed out on all that swag 😫. Damn it all to hell!! I’ve actually had this book on my kindle for awhile but like most things kindle it takes awhile. But, when I started out with the book, I couldn’t get into it. I was on crack apparently but my sweet friend told me to push on so I’m naming her as a recommendation and I love her for telling me to keep going!! Anyhoo....I freaking love, Misaki!!!!!!!!!
And for the moment, Misaki let herself be thankful for the thing she was. After all, a lady wouldn’t have been able to slice a man’s legs out from under him and then plunge a blade into his mouth when he opened it to scream. A mother wouldn’t have been able to cut a young woman’s head from her shoulders. A human being wouldn’t have been able to turn from their dismembered corpses without a single pang of guilt. Thank the Gods she was a monster.
Omg!! Why 😫Omg!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS EVERYTHING!! WENT TO FAVORITES LIST!! MISAKI IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL!! 
"You lost your right to my obedience when you stopped being a man!" Misaki cut him off. "If you want me to go back to the house, you’ll have to fight me. I’ve stood by too long while you disgraced yourself, but this—this is the last time you will be weak in front of me. One of us is going to rest here with our son. Draw!
