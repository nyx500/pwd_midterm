In this ambitious, self-published, standalone fantasy novel, M.L. Wang tells the story of a conservative warrior society and the impact of war on the relationships in a family of magical fighters.There are many good aspects of this novel, especially the last third which focuses on the impact of the main battle on the family. While the world-building is expansive, the novel truly shines when it focuses on the smaller scale of personal relationships. The author is very talented, and with some editing this could have been a masterpiece. There were some annoyances throughout the book, viz., the fantasy society was copied directly from Japanese culture, there was an overzealous and unjustifiable use of italicized dialogue, the magic followed a traditional elemental system, and much of the world-building was done as info-dumps with little relevance to the key story. In my opinion, the novel would have been more effective if it had been scaled back in scope.Still, there is much to love here, especially the emotional impact in the final third of the book.Note: this book is not nearly as dark as "The Poppy War," despite claims to the contrary. "The Poppy War" is definitely the better of the two books.
