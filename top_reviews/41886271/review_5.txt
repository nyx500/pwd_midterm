alright. lets break down how i feel about this book.things i liked:interesting world building - i really loved the old traditional japanese feel to the story and the setting is described in a way that makes it very easy to feel immersed.the characters - really well-rounded and complex characters that go through some great development, so its not difficult to root for them.all dialogue - the vast majority of the narration is dialogue and i personally enjoy that because it always makes for quick and easy entertainment.things i didnt like:odd pacing - the climax takes place in the middle of the story and the remaining 60% feel like a very extended epilogue.unclear genre - with elemental magic, brief sci-fi technology, a setting in a modern future but has made-up lands/empire like traditional fantasy, this felt all over the place. more positives than there are negatives, so a pretty good reading experience overall. i would be really interested to see if this becomes a series. the ending definitely lays the groundwork for a sequel, so i will be keeping my eyes open.â†  3.5 stars
