Two books through this trilogy (because I'm very unsure about reading past that, since Nix has started doing prequels and such) and I'm STILL uncertain how I feel about it. I reread my Sabriel review and basically find myself feeling the same way, if rather reluctantly. As I mentioned in my last update, these books are sometimes difficult to focus on, but by the end I want to go back and reread them to piece everything together. Lirael and Sameth both felt very realistic, although I was disappointed that the story didn't pick up where Sabriel had left off -- it made the romance between her and Touchstone feel very insta-love, but alas. Looking forward to reading Abhorsen though.Also, Tim Curry's narration is very good. Audiobook recommended :)
