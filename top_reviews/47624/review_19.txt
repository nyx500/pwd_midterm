Ya’ll I remember my childhood trauma of picking up this sequel to Sabriel and realizing that it was not in fact about Sabriel and we had to follow this random other girl who wasn’t my awesome heroine of the last novel. However, as we got a librarian introvert who’s only true friend is a talking dog…I really didn’t end up minding. In fact, I fell in love, which is pretty hard to do after emotionally devastating me first that Sabriel was all ‘old’ and married with kids now. Devastated preteen me was all set up to hate on Lireal as a lesser character but that did not happen at all (though Sameth was definitely a little shit). Lirael follows the titled Lirael who lives as a Clayr in the Glacier of the Old Kingdom. Born to a group of people that all get the gift of the Sight, Lireal feels more and more left out and different as she is never called to her power. She ends up making her own adventures, becoming a librarian (a much more dangerous enterprise in their world than ours) and making lots of interesting friends and discoveries. Meanwhile, as we are 14+ years after the events of Sabriel, Sabriel’s youngest son Sameth who grew up across the wall from the Old Kingdom is brought back and forced to begin training as the next Abhorsen after he is attacked. Eventually, these two adventures and many dangers find themselves colliding. I don’t know if I can talk about this story too much without revealing more about it then is necessary but just know that it is lovely. A different but wonderful follow up to Sabriel with a character who has a quiet kind of strength that I think a lot of dorky little readers (like me) might relate to and find comfort in the closeness of a dog friend. Sameth was fiiiine. I kept having to remind myself that he was young to be so whiny lol but Lirael more than makes up for him and his development is actually worthwhile even if it is a little slow. This one has two talking animals so twice the fun and adventure. I loved this! Read this trilogy!
