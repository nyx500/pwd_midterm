4.5/5.0This is a fabulous book, and duology, if one enjoys the world of spy’s, intrigue and what goes on behind the scenes of a revolution! I had honestly never thought much about the subject before, but Ms. Pierce tells such a riveting story that one can’t help but get hooked! I especially love the fact that the author centers on the characters and allows the reader to get to know and soon love each and everyone. That genius also explains the reasons why so many of her series focus on characters from previous series (don’t worry, all are completely standalone series. I haven’t even read the series that begin it all and still love every single one I pick up). We truly do invest so fully in them that we ache to know each and every story! And, of course, as the plot of both books is creating a revolution that will overturn an unjust and awful monarchy, this second installment slowly and methodically works toward that climax. It is never boring, however (it’s all that delicious spy stuff that keeps one turning the pages!) The only thing in the entire duo that I was disappointed in was the way Aly’s family and roots were handled. I was SO anxious to read the big “reveal”, especially given both Sarai and Dove were so enamored with the Lioness, her exploits and example in the first book. I could hardly wait until they found out the truth! Sadly, it didn’t turn out the way I so desperately hoped - with all the awe and excitement accompanying the “TaDA!” moment. *sigh*. It was a grave injustice to my expectations, I’ll admit.Still, I thoroughly enjoyed and relished the entire experience. THIS is what fantasy fiction is meant to be!
