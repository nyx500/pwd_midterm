I'm a huge Tamora Pierce fan. Her Song of the Lioness and Immortals series both count among my childhood-defining books (I feel secure in crediting Alanna with my strange fascination with girls disguising themselves as boys, and Daine and Numair were likely a part of why I like a good mentor/student relationship). So I was really freaking excited when her new series came out. Pierce is great with character continuity, and she likes to bring characters from former series into her new ones, which I love. Plus, the main character, Aly, is Alanna's daughter, which pretty much guaranteed the girl would kick some ass.And she did kick some ass. Too much, really.Alanna and Daine (Pierce's previous protagonists, for the record) were both strong, fully formed characters. They had flaws, and weaknesses, just as they had talents and strengths. Her strong, realistic female characters are a huge part of why I'm such a huge fan.So when I realized that Aly had inherited all of her mother's talents and powers, a long with her father's, plus she had every important or talented person in the entire kingdom fawning over her and teaching her their skills (all of which she excelled at, of course), I was flat out pissed. It's a long fall down from Pierce's earlier protagonists to Aly, and it was a painful landing.That said, the book was fun, I appreciate that Pierce at least got Aly out on her own in the world, and Pierce's flat characters are still good characters overall.
