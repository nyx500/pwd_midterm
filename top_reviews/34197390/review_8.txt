Aly is one of my all-time favorite heroines to hail from Tortall. That she uses her intelligence and quick wit to accomplish everything that she does in astonishing. I love getting lost in the dark and twisty place that is the spy world of the Copper Isles. I've read these books so many times and will continue to do so - I just can't get enough. Highly recommended to anyone, anywhere, anytime.
