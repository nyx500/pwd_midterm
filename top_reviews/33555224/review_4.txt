My original review still stands. Shusterman played us. Hard! That ending is one of the best and psychotic endings I’ve had the pleasure of reading. Goddard has now taken his rightful place as the most hated characters on my list. Above Umbridge. Voldemort. Honestly, every villain seems tame in comparison to that punk. Please, I need a disgusting and brutal end for him. Not just a basic gleaning.I can't wait to see what Shusterman's brilliant mind has come up with for book three. There is SO much to look forward to!—————————SHUSTERMAN, I NEED ANSWERS! HOW DARE YOU LEAVE US IN A STATE OF ABSOLUTE DISARRAY?! My mind! What does this all mean? How will everything be resolved in the third book?!I thought I could review this, but I can't really. So just pick up this series, I implore you.—————————Book one obliterated me.This book will probably finish me. —————————I’m not even halfway through Scythe and I just ordered the sequel because the book is that stupidly good!
