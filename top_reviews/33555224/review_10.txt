Second time reading and that ending!!!Still worth every stars. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~First read: 26/4/18Hot damn. That ending. Shit absolutely and unequivocally just hit the fan but... no worries. It’s only a year right?The cruelty...I pondered for days over how to rate this (needlessly it seems) because I finally came to my senses. There’s nothing to overthink here because I am so fucking speechless that I don’t know how I could give this anything less than what it deserves. NS is. A. Genius.The symbolism, the intricacies of the overarching plot and the religious imagery that took root in book one and brilliantly and ever so subtly intertwined in this book is simply... awe inspiring. Everything was artfully constructed. All I can say is: read between the lines. Shusterman is onto something here.
