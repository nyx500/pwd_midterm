its 2018, so can we just go ahead and put forth a movement that says cliffhangers qualify as cruel and unusual punishment!? i mean, i will start a petition and everything. whos with me??? because there is no way the ending to this should be legal. its the very essence of torture. okay. now that i got that out of my system, lets talk about everything other than the last 30 pages. im pretty sure i am in the minority when i say that i didnt think this was better than scythe, but i didnt think it was worse either. if anything, i found them both to be quite equal and consistent, which i find to be rare in a series. as with scythe, i thought the writing and storytelling was wonderful. the originality and creativity of this story was beyond phenomenal. i loved the new characters and visits from old ones. im so very excited to see how the series will continue. if there was one thing i would change about this it would be rowans character arc. i was desperate for him to get some sort of break or absolution for having been dealt a crappy hand in the first book. i was pleading with everyone to see that the reason he is the way he is was because he was forcibly placed in a horrible environment and his behaviour is a product of needing to survive. i understand how the continuation of his unfortunate circumstances helped move the plot along, but goodness. the boy just needs some TLC in his life. is that too much to ask?! i swear, the next book better have rowan healthy and happy, or else i will start another petition. so you better watch out, shusterman. lol. â†  3.5 stars
