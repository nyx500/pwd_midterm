"Scythe Johannes Brahms, you are accused of abusing your position and multiple crimes against humanity." "How dare you!" Brahms gasped. "Who are you to accuse me?" He struggled, trying to rally strength, but it was no use. The painkillers that were in his system were filling his responses. His muscles were weak and useless to him now.  "I think you know who I am," the young man said. "Let me hear you say it." "I will not!" Brahms said, determined not to give him the satisfaction. But the boy in black jammed a knee so powerfully into Brahm's chest that he thought his heart would stop. More pain nanites. More opiates. Brahm's head was swimming. He had no choice but to comply.  "Lucifer," he gasped. "Scythe Lucifer."
Rowan is doing his own thing and I just love him! Love him! There wasn't enough of him in the book though. Scythe Anatasia (Citra) has her own way of gleaning people, which has the scythedom in a uproar. Actually, Rowan and Citra have them in an uproar. We have the Thunderhead giving us tidbits here and there and he's using someone to try to sort things out. I enjoyed Greyson in the book. He had all kinds of stuff going on with him and that ending with him! What!? Actually, that ending, PERIOD! There was some sadness there =( I can't even begin to imagine what will happen in the next book! I hope everything will be okay!!! 😫😫Overall, I enjoyed it, but I just wish there were a bit more to it. It was a little slow in some areas for me. Happy Reading!
