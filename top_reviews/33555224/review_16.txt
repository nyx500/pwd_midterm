❥ 5 / 5 starsQuestion (10 points)Is the romance in this book / this trilogy necessary?.....
Answer
 —> No.Everything in the story is already perfect on its own. Even if there’s no romance between Citra and Rowan or other couples, it‘s still completely fine and the book itself can easily make me love it without that. Therefore, I see no reason why 
Neal Shusterman
 need to include romance in the trilogy if he cannot make it good enough or make it at least believable. (It’s harsh. I know. But if you ask me, I think this is the only weakness of Arc of a Scythe.)However, since he already tried and it would be cruel if I let it affect the rating, I decided to look at the whole picture instead and yeah, unsurprisingly, it deserved 5 stars. ★★★★★P.S. I like that plot twists always intrigue me. So, keep doing that. :) (I admit that sometimes it’s kinda too much for my heart but it’s what make the book fun, right?)P.P.S. Despite P.S., still damn you, Neal!!! How come you killed one of my favourite characters?! Though I like unexpected things, this is utterly unforgivable and I won’t stop being pissed at you.
