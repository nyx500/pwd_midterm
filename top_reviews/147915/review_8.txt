My favourite book of the series so far! I will not ruin it for anybody, but this book turned me into an emotional reck in the best and worse possible ways. It gave me moments were I found myself jumping round like a child who actually did get a pony for christmas, moments when I bawled like a baby and finally, moments when I was yelling my head off, threatening to never read another page and swearing like a banshee. This series needs to form part of everyone's life - it is so unpredictable and engrossing that it has to be up there with the greats.
