O.OOkay. You know what time it is (besides 9.00 p.m. on a Tuesday night) - ASoIaF gif reaction time!So, after an extended break after reading A Clash of Kings, it was time to jump into A Storm of Swords.

And everything was good. 

.. Even the Davos chapters.



Until..







And though slightly spoiled for part of the story, I was entirely unprepared for the feels.



At first I was all, "This book is DEAD TO ME."

Then my grief became anger.

Then resignation..



And finally determination.

Until.. that ending.
