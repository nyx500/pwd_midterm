“In King’s Landing, there are two sorts of people. The players and the pieces.”
A Storm of Swords is responsible for so many of the now-iconic moments from Game of Thrones. The Red Wedding, The Purple Wedding,  Tyrion's trial and Tywin's death, Oberyn Martell and Gregor Clegane's fight, Daenerys conquering of the cities, especially Astapor and so much more. So it's not surprising this is such a well-loved instalment of the series. I do have to agree with the masses and say this is the best of the ASOIAF books so far. The first half is excellently plotted with meticulous character and political arcs, and the second half is a whirlwind of action and drama that undermines expectations over and over. Sam and Davos are extremely boring but, beside their chapters, I genuinely loved every POV included in this book and every character and plot arc. AND THAT EPILOGUE !!
“You are grown so very great now, yet the higher a man climbs the farther he has to fall.”
And onto A Feast for Crows! Who knows when I'll get to it, though. I like that this is a world I can easily jump in and out of. I did have a lot of fun with this though, and I'll be looking forward to seeing what comes next (especially since I believe we're getting to the point where the book and show start to really deviate)
