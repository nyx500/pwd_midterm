I have slowly been making my way through the Song of Ice and Fire series and this has been my favourite of what I have read so far. In case you are wondering I have watched all of the TV show so I do know what is going to happen in the books before I read them but this doesn’t really bother me. I won’t go into detail about the plot of this book as I wouldn’t want to spoil it for anyone but I would definitely recommend to anyone who hasn’t yet picked up the series. All of my favourites characters were doing awesome things in this book and I simply loved it! ★ ★ ★ ★ ★
