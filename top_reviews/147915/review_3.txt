“Night’s King was only a man by light of day...but the night was his to rule. And it’s getting dark.”This one is definitely a game changer! I’ve never known so many major and minor characters to be killed off in a book - must be some kind of record! I really can’t say a lot without spoilers. The war for the iron throne is ongoing but it seems being away from the battle can be just as deadly as fighting in it! “It was not for murder that the gods punished him...but for slewing a guest under his roof; that the gods cannot forgive.” I am loving this series! All the action that is happening at the same time to the different characters in different areas is so addictive! I love seeing how the characters interlink - and I fear for what will happen to them all next! Arya is about to head off across the water after escaping numerous brigands, Sansa has found new troubles in a new place, Bran keeps on travelling, Davos still fights on for Stannis despite his Red Priestess, Brienne has fulfilled part of her vow and is off to fulfill the rest. Jaime is changed from his time with Robb and Catelyn, Tyrion’s family issues just get worse! Jon and Sam are having their own problems on the wall, far removed from all those in the South. Daenerys is conquering the East city by city. And where is Theon Greyjoy? Bring on A Feast for Crows!“We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance on in our stead.”
