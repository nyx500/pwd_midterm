“We look up at the same stars and see such different things.”God that took me months and months! At first I couldn't find the motivation, then there were other books I desperately wanted to read. So this giant of a book had to wait.When I finally picked it up again, I finished it in a week. While I had a slow start (I really did not want to read about the Red Wedding), I didn't want to put it down again. The plot thickened and every single chapter was intruiging, even those of the less interesting characters.Here's the list of POV's from what I liked most to what I enjoyed the least:DaenerysTyrionSansaJonAryaJaimeBranSamwellDavosCatelynFind more of my books on Instagram
