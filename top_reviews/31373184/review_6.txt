Reread 2022 - 2.5 Stars - I don’t like it. I’m not sure why I have it 5 stars before. I was mostly bored but I’m giving it 2.5 stars for the gang. I’m going to unhaul my hardbacks of the first two and I probably won’t read the 3rd one unless I get it from the library. I loved The Raven Boys and I hope I still do on my reread of them, I’m pretty sure I will though 💕 We shall see. ********************Here's the awesome CALL DOWN THE HAWK BOX FROM OWLCRATE! Let me just say, I'm so glad they got their special edition cover! I love theirs more than the original cover! Click on the GOODIES LINK to see the awesome GOODIES!THE GOODIES LINKMel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
