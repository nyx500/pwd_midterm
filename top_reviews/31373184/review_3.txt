You are made of dreams and this world is not for you.
Ronan Lynch thought he was alright with staying at the Barns but what once felt like freedom is becoming increasingly more like a cage. 
But joy is a small, tenacious crop, especially in soil that hasn't grown any for a long time.
After a disastrous visit to Adam's dorm room, Ronan realizes that he cannot continue balancing so perilously close to danger.Unbeknownst to him, there is something hunting (and eliminating) the dreamers. Jordan Hennessy is a flawless art thief and one of many. Danger is circling ever-closer to her and disaster is around every corner.With Carmen Farooq-Lane on the side of the hunters, and the fate of the world is determined by the outcome, she will stop at nothing until they are all eliminated.
Dreams are not the safest thing to build a life on.
So. I tried reading this one when it first came out and...I couldn't. I actually got so angry at it that I had to set it down.It was too many characters, too many creatures and too much happening. It wasn't remotely the same as the Raven Boys and I truly thought this was going to be a disaster rivaling the Shiver series.BUT THEN I got a free trial from scribd and decided to give Call Down the Hawk another shot.And honestly...I don't know what I was thinking that first round.I loved this book.I think the first round I was just so mad that this book wasn't Raven Boys #5 that I just threw up my hands and gave up.But after taking (a lot) of time to cool off, the second round of Call Down the Hawk felt like coming home.I loved the plot, the return of the characters and (above all) the magical narration of Will Patton.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
