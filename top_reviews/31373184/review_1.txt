"CALL down the hawk from the air;Let him be hooded or cagedTill the yellow eye has grown mild,For larder and spit are bare,The old cook enraged,The scullion gone wild.""I will not be clapped in a hood,Nor a cage, nor alight upon wrist,Now I have learnt to be proudHovering over the woodIn the broken mistOr tumbling cloud.""What tumbling cloud did you cleave,Yellow-eyed hawk of the mind,Last evening? that I, who had satDumfounded before a knave,Should give to my friendA pretence of wit."- w. b. yeats, "The Hawk"First 8 chapters can be read free here! https://www.scribd.com/document/41236...Chapter-by-chapter playlist of songs I listened to while writing it here: http://maggiestiefvater.com/call-down...
