In this epic finale, S.A.C. delivered yet again. So much bloodshed though, friends, enemies, innocents, nobles, servants, young and old, no one spared the brutality of war.Daevabald was free from one tyrant only to be plunged deep into the hands of another, Menizeh. She made the previous ruthless dictator look like a saint. With magic gone, Menizeh got desperate and gave in to the vilest of evil to maintain control. She got the power she sought, but she lost the people.It was up to Nahri and Abu-Zayid to find a way to dethrone Menizeh, who has the greatest warrior in their history mind-controlled and wraiths at her beckon...SO MUCH BLOODSHED.Empire of Gold was an epic conclusion to the Daevabald trilogy. I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed this series very much. 5 stars.
