I love this trilogy so much itâ€™s unrealMore thoughts on my YouTube channel https://youtu.be/8NtUPX_koyYEmpire of Gold was truly a perfect finale in my opinion, it expanded the world so beautifully, it answered all my questions and even a few new ones I never thought to ask. It had adventure and plot twists and character development, and everything else I could have wanted from this wonderfully whimisical fantasy series. The way that Chakraborty is also able to naviagate discussions of the cyclical nature of war and violence, prejudice, etc., was really brillant for me. I think that this book was truly phenomenal and if I had to think of some flaws I'd say that at times the plot was a bit too convenient, and Chakraborty adds alot of new mythology in this book so it may feel overwhelming to some, but for me it wasn't an issue I enjoyed the way the story played out immensely.
