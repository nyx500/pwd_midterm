Fact: I stayed up all night to finish this 28 hr audiobook in under 3 days. And frankly I'm not sure whether to be impressed, or concerned about my priorities. Fact 2: if Fact 1 doesn't evidence how compelling this story was, I don't know what will. This was easilyy my MOST anticipated book for 2020, and (disregarding lessons learnt from my past experiences) I had raised my expectations extortionaly high. Yet...miraculously (thank god!) this time I was NOT disappointed. That said, the one thing I didn't like was the way Ali and Nahri's relationship was handled. It was mainly moments of lust which felt out of character for both of them, especially Ali. I mean staring hungrily at the expanse of Nahri's WRIST? Come on. They still had some cute moments though like the ones I lovedd in book 2. Infact, if you've followed my reviews for book 1 and 2, you'd know I've never been a huge fan of Dara, and Ali has always been my fave. However, for once I think Daradefinitely deserved some more page-time (I mean 13 out of 47 chapters hardly seems fair) because his arc was amazinggg and I needed more of it! Nonetheless, let it be known: I now love Dara.All in all, the above 2 things are really my only critiques of this otherwise spectacular finale to one of my favourite trilogies ever! It really was the best ending I could've asked for, and better than I could've imagined. _______________________________UPDATE: Expected publication is now FEBRUARY!! *jumps up and down whilst squeling*_______________________________Omg would you just look at that GORGEOUS cover!Now that I'm all hyped up again, I'm 100% sure that I need an ARC. Besides, I've been dangling off the cliff in book 2 for far too long already and I'm not strong enough to hold on for much longer. And does the fact that I've never recieved an ARC before (sob) stop me from promising to do anything and everything to get my hands on this book before April? Psshh NO. Of course not. So basically what I'm trying to say is:If you're in a position to give out ARCs, please please can you save me? Pretty sure my mental health will deteriorate otherwise (in other words, I will lose my mind). Thank you
