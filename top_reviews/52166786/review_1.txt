‘the city of brass’
 handed me a map and started me off on an enticingly ambitious journey. 
‘the kingdom of copper’
 had me at a fork in the road, unable to choose a path as i did not know my destination.
‘the empire of gold’
 has rewarded me for my struggles and has shown me that the journey, no matter the obstacles, is worth it. this book is the X on the map, the lost city of wonder, the hidden oasis in the desert. it is the final resting point at which a traveller can see just how far they have come, understand just how much they learned and grew from the challenges they faced, all while being surrounded by old friends and new ones they made along the way. i feel so at peace.↠ 5 stars
