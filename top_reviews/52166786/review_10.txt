A 2020 Goodreads Choice finalist in Fantasy!
It’s really no secret how much I’ve adored this series. From the moment we met Nahri in The City of Brass, I knew this was going to be a special story. I’d like to just take a beat and thank Shannon Chakraborty for transporting us into a world of her own imagining; I feel truly lucky to have been able to experience her creation.“Creator, every time I think I’ve found the bottom in all of this, I get some new story of murder and vengeance.”But for those who haven’t had the opportunity yet, I don’t want to mislead anyone into thinking this is a series of just beautiful magic set in a far away place. Though the characters are powerful djinn, the setting an enchanted city, at the center of the story is revenge and violence, passed down through the generations. Pain and grudges are inherited, just like their powers, and it can be a difficult cycle to break out of. Empire of Gold is the final comeuppance for all the characters who have been reeling with this legacy of grief and trauma. Each of the younger ones are forced to make a decision: will they let their ancestral anger dictate their paths or will they forge their own? I’m sure there’s a lot of parallels to Middle Eastern history and politics represented between the 6 tribes which I am not aware of. But you don’t have to have any sort of background knowledge before diving into this series; you just need to prepare to have your beliefs challenged again and again. And take my word for it, Chakraborty doesn’t let anyone get away with feeling 100% vindicated. This is an entire society painted in shades of grey, much like our own.“she wasn’t going to waste her life regretting other people’s choices”There wasn’t one character I didn’t feel for in some way. Nahri is our protagonist that tries her best, but is struggling with identity. Ali is devout, rigid in his beliefs, and always attempting to do the right thing. Dara is strong, passionate and stubborn, with a relentless loyalty to those he loves. I won’t give a blurb for every single character, but Zaynab, Muntadhir and Jamshid are also completely captivating. Throughout all three books, Chakraborty explores themes of family, both who you’re related to and that which you choose for yourself. Similarly, we examine the importance of a shared history, of a shared culture. The importance of someone’s name. It’s up to each person to decide which pieces of themselves make up their own identity. You don’t have to answer for every mistake your family or friends have made, but each of us is responsible for the choices we make. We are culpable in accepting the status quo when it benefits us to someone else’s detriment, even if we aren’t the ones to created that power structure in the first place. Seeing something wrong and doing nothing causes just as much damage.Please note I have barely scratched the surface of everything covered in these books! Read some other reviews so you can get a fuller picture. If this was being adapted for film instead of a Netflix series, this book would be split into at least two movies. Not just because of the length, but the huge amount of plot and territory that’s covered. But since it 
is
 going to be a Netflix show, I would also like to congratulate Shannon & the fandom because honestly this is huge for us too!! 🥳 I’m so excited to see Daevabad on the big/small/silver screen, or whatever it’s called. I’m sure it’ll be more than any of us can dare to imagine. 🧞✨I will keep the spoiler section short:“You have earned your happy ending, little thief. Let me do the same. Let me earn a place in the garden with my family.” “Find your happiness, little thief. Steal it and do not ever let it go.”😭😩😢“Grandfather?”🥺Anyways. It’s over. It’s done. I’m going to be entirely useless the rest of the day as I process what that means for me going forward.**For more book talk & reviews, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!
