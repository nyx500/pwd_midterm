This was everything! 😍😍I will not claim to have understood everything but I loved it nonetheless! 🥰The end to this trilogy was everything I could have asked for. The extensive world building is expanded even further, the characters are pushed to the absolute limit. The conclusion was just perfect. I feel like I can’t go into it without spoilers but everything that unfurled I was pleased with. I’m not going to yammer on because I’m just all gush and no substance. Just. If you enjoy epic fantasy then pick up this series!!!! ************************Library copy available for pick up. I will finally get the answers I need!! 😁********************I don’t usually care about the romances in books but I really hope Nahri and Ali are endgame and not Dara. I hate the trope where a girl falls in love with a man/being that is like thousands of years older than them. And I just love the friends to lovers trope! Roll on June!!!!
