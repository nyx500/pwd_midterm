anyway this series is dead to me, dara iâ€™ll get you out of there!!!!!!!!!Update: 08/08/20 - Every time I think about this book, the more disappointment I feel and I want to take off yet another star, so here we are at a 2. Had it not been for Dara's arc and chapters, it may as well have been a 1. :) Everyone say thank you Darayavahoush e-Afshin for carrying this series on his back.If you really want to know why this conclusion sucked, here's a 10k word long post with all my many grievances. Very spoilery. You've been warned.
