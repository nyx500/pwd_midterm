This was cute! It definitely had those common tropes that can get kind of boring and repetitive like the chosen one, or the whole “she‘s not like other girls” thing, but if you can get past that then it’s a cute middle grade story! There’s definitely a lot left unanswered and since there’s literally been like 9 other books published since this one released, I’m assuming I’ll get answers there lol
