that was not what i expected and i have to say i’m glad. this is my first middle grade in a while (other than Renegades because that WAS NOT A YA) anyway i’m going to answer some questions that i looked up online hahaWho was your favorite character and why?Keefe was my favorite character🥰. i loved how he was the funny one in every situation. He sort of reminded me of Adrian (from Vampire Academy not Renegades lol) and any character like him is automatically my fav😌Who was your least favorite character and why?I don’t really have a least favorite character, but if i’m taking about characters that annoyed me, i would have to say Dex and Fitz. Dex was just idk man he just needed to chill. I really liked Fitz in the very beginning, but in the middle it seemed like he was really not a good friend. What was the most exciting/boring part of the book? The beginning-middle part of the book was kind of boring. I mean it just felt slow and overall I don’t think the book needed to be that long. My favorite part was probably the middle-end part. I liked seeing her classes but also when she got kidnapped that was super fun too😳👀Were the descriptions in the book good?Yes. When Sophie was originally taken the other world (can’t remember what it’s called lol) it was really cool to read about what it all looked like. I would love to visit sometime ;)Describe the book in one sentenceSophie getting confused by everything (then knowing something she shouldn’t) for 488 pages. also I buddy read this with Adela ✨“Everyone congratulated her – except Keefe, who leaned in and whispered, “Told you so,” when his dad wasn’t looking.”i need more keefe that all i have to say. is he a big character or is he just on the side please tell me.ok it’s 4am i’m gonna go to sleep😋
