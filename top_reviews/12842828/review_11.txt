Honestly? I hated this book and I was expecting so much more. This is a pretty disgusting book, especially with someone like Sophie for the main character. I generally don't like Mary Sue characters and this is the perfect stereotype for it. She is so annoyingly ✨speshul✨. She so "smart," but in reality, she's literally an idiot. I've read several books in this series, and all Sophie does for at least 80% of the book is go "hMMMMMMMMMmmmmm i wOndEr wHy?" The "romance" in this is messed up. She meets a random guy elf, and you know, they all have to be good-looking and pErFecT because they're elves. So naturally, she has a crush on every single one around her age, and they all like her back. Wonderful, isn't it? The last thing is I'd say all of the characters would be better if they were more diverse. The dwarves, the people who do work for the elves, just to happen to have dark skin. But no, they're not sErVanTs, they willingly help them! I don't like that, and I wish there were some more major characters that are diverse. Occasionally there's a minor character that has a slightly darker skin tone, but not enough to make this book any less stereotypical than it already is. 1.5/5 stars, rounded down to 1.
