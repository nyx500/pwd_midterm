This is the beautiful beginning of a new obsession. ðŸ’–I just wanted to read a fun middle grade book, but I got something that totally blew my mind. I already orderd the next one when I was only halfway through, but I won't be able to calm down until it arrives!The characters are everything, although I don't trust anyone except my baby Dex. And when I say this book has the best found family (with parents), I don't lie. That is my favourite part of the whole story. Buddy read with Rue.
