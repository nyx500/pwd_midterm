WOW!!! This book was WONDERFUL!!! My favorite read of 2018. Where to start... Romance- Sophie did have crushes of boys; mentions of hugging, hand holding... nothing bad at all. Violence/content- Two of the main characters get kidnapped; lots of magic, feeling severely alone; mentions of being drugged (while kidnapped), etc. First off- Shannon Messenger is an INCREDIBLE author. I cannot wait to read more of her work. The world-building in this book is mesmerizing. The details and choice of words were so beautifully precise that I could SEE the images that the author created. The plot was amazing. It had so many plot twists and cliff-hangers. Some books that I read consist only of constant action, and therefore, the characters are lacking realness and creativity. The characters were so real, frustrating, loving, heart-wrenching... ❤️ With every word I read, the characters became more special to me. This book left me in a daze until I finished it, and I LOVE the characters. Oh! And btw- I am totally team Sophitz... 😏😏😏
