Parts of these books I really like -- and then other parts make me want to either throw the book across the room, or smack Mercedes upside the head a few times.Lackey is pretty darned good at manipulating emotions when she sets her mind to it. I'm just as susceptible to melodrama as the next person, and probably more susceptible than many -- and Lackey's books don't lack for that. On the other hand, Lackey often doesn't seem terribly concerned with logic. For instance, an especially egregious (and significant!) example turns up when Vanyel "suddenly" notices that he's the last Herald-Mage. Seriously?? Seriously, nobody ever noticed that: 1. they were running out of Herald-Mages at a rapid rate; and 2. when they were already down to 4 Herald-Mages, nobody was worried when two of them suddenly died mysteriously; and 3. nobody cared that no new recruits had been turning up for training for YEARS?? Nobody went out to try to find any?? And 4. somehow the Herald-Mages IN Valdemar couldn't find anyone to train, but an evil mage in a DIFFERENT country could sniff out the potential recruits and kill em anyway?? SERIOUSLY?????. Le Sigh. Anyway - these books can be fun, as long as you totally turn off any powers of critical thinking. Maybe have a few beers first. Go with the flow, try to think like a 15 year old girl, have a few sniffles, watch you brain bleed out your ears for awhile. Just don't try to apply any rules of rationality -- That Way Lies Madness.
