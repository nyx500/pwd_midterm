A fitting end to the trilogy - there have been enough hints through the previous two books that you know where it's going (hell, the clues in the name of the trilogy!).As usual, there is a lot of build up and all the action is crammed into the last couple of chapters, but as I knew to expect that it didn't worry me this time round. I was kind of getting a little bit bored with Van's constant angst anyway ... you'd have thought he'd got over a lot of his worries and insecurities by the time this book kicks off.The very ending is a little bit too twee for me - it did fit in with the rest of the story, but I personally like my fantasy a little darker.My overall thoughts on the whole trilogy - an enjoyable read, but think romance with a twist and a dash of fantasy. If you go into them in that mindset, you won't be disappointed.
