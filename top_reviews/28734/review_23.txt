Hello, hello there are spoilers all over this review. Consider yourself warned.I really wish there was more set up in the previous book for Vanyel and Stefen's relationship (and that Stefan was just a tad older but that's just me). It felt tacked on, rushed and just placed there to make the ending more of a gut punch. I hated the ending, and it's casual deployment of gang rape on Vanyel. What a horrendously lazy way to inject ineffectual drama in an already stuffed last 1/4 of the book. If the big bad isn't sufficiently fleshed out enough for the reader to feel in any way tense, then throw some rape in there. Lazy. Whatever else was in the book, I don't quite remember. I'm too angry over the lazy ending. Then again, if I can't remember then nothing too important must've happened.
