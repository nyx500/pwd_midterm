Review may contain spoilers for those who have not read the first two books in the Last Herald-Mage series. Vanyel gets a new boyfriend. Sure, there's a lot of other stuff about ruling a kingdom steward-style for the ailing king and loads of heroic feats including surviving torture, defeating an entire army with several powerful mages, and dying a bloody death. But mostly, Vanyel gets an awesome new boyfriend.  It turns out that this new fellow is the reincarnation of the old fellow, but I choose to not care about the implications of that.  Because Stefen is not a Herald. He doesn't get a magic pony who loves him always because he isn't even a little bit self sacrificing. While he loves Vanyel, Stefen's first--and only--action is to for cover when the two of them are facing one of those armies I mentioned earlier. Stefen is a typical Bard. Not only is he as shaych as a jaybird, he has no problems with using his Gifts to show off, influence other people, or gain material wealth. He is perfectly willing to alternately nag and manipulate Vanyel to get what he wants from his lover, although he does accept and support Vanyel in his dangerous line of work. However, he doesn't entirely understand that heroic drive to help others to the utter exclusion of one's own comfort that defines all Heralds. In other words, Stefen is a realistic person. Not a common find in fantasy novels. This is definitely my favorite trilogy in the Valdemar series.
