Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire for Young Adults 2016. Dabos’ second book in the internationally popular Mirror Visitor fantasy series provides wonderful continuity to the story readers were introduced to in A Winter’s Promise. French author Dabos has fun building this fantastical world that her heroine Ophelia has to navigate through. The plot is filled with animists, dragons, immortals, invisibles, nihilists, and Valkyries. They all inhabit a shard of planetary substance—the Ark of Citaceleste, and ruled by Farouk the family spirit. Recommend this enchanting book series.
