Re-Read 2/18/22:This must be my 6th time reading this and I cried like a baby at certain parts all over again as if it was my first.More importantly, I read it with my daughter, so it WAS her first time. Say what you will about the author, he wrote a fantastically empathetic book that works on so many damn levels. And this time, my daughter and I both bawled our eyes out together.I'm so glad I can introduce her to a true love of SF. :)Original review:So nice to read it again. I suppose I can point to this book as being one of the very first to open my eyes to just how much can be accomplished in SF.I mean, sure, I first read Chriton's Sphere right after King's Tommyknockers so I was feeling the love already, but Ender's Game set a new standard in readability, emotional impact, and sheer cussed F***ed-up-ness.Since then, I've read over twenty novels that shared echoes of this novel. And yet, I keep coming back to this and its companion, Speaker for the Dead, glorying in the wonder of all these little pieces coming together in plots both interesting, tragic, and wonderful.This is one of those rare cases where popularity is not unfounded. A great tale meets great acclaim. I can rank this up near Dune as one of my most beloved novels of all time. No question about it.Do I pity Ender? Hell, yes. But more than that: I admire him.
