“Fear is no bad thing,” Orka said. “How can you be brave if you do not feel fear?” 

In the past six months I have read almost everything by Gwynne (except for Malice which I read a year ago) and I enjoyed all of these. In fact, TFATF became my favorite quartet of all time. I was ecstatic when I was approved for an ARC of this because it means I could continue this journey (Thanks for the publisher who approved me through Netgalley).This is a completely new series with a new cast and a new world so people who always wanted to read Gwynne can start with it. I won’t be comparing it to the previous series because they are different.This book follows three characters:💉 Orka: I have been hearing a ton of great things about Orka from everyone who read the book. So she’s a warrior in search for vengeance and her lost son!💉 Varg: He’s trying to find what happened when his sister died and who did it. He joins the Bloodsworn to get more answers.💉 Elvar: She comes from a slightly more fancy background but she’s trying to make her own name known through her war efforts!I know most readers have Orka as their favorite character but for me, those POVs were dynamic because every few chapters changed who I was enjoying and who I was a bit less interested in. Overall, the characters are well written and their stories are engaging specially in the last third or something. I still believe that TFATF is my favorite Gwynne book though because of its spectacular characterization.

“You are wrong,” Elvar said. “It is kin who are a curse. You cannot choose them; they are inflicted upon you. They are the poison.” 

Now the writing is good, I think I am more used to Gwynne writing after reading 7 of his books. As mentioned above, this is a different world so there were new terms and I wish we had a glossary for those and the characters (Of Blood and Bone had a character glossary from the first book). I think there was a lot of Jargon that I was not familiar with and would have appreciated a way to know what is meant by them since I am not the biggest expert on Norse mythology despite being a fan. I did get most of the terms by the end of the book but I would have preferred an “easier” way. It wasn’t hard for me to follow the characters but once again, a glossary is something I always appreciate in a book and Gwynne proved he is so good at writing those in the past.The world-building is great, I like the new world and atmosphere. I like the incorporation of Gods and magic whether through bloodlines or their bones. I also liked the weapons and clothes and all those little details.The pacing is slow for the most part with most of the action happening in the last chapters. I always enjoyed Gwynne’s endings and this was not different. I have to mention though that I found this one kind of predictable compared to the previous books and I think it is actually because I read the previous books. I just develop a feeling of how the author thinks and writes and what stuff is ingrained in their writing which was the case here. I am not saying it is a bad thing because with Gwynne it is usually the most appropriate choice that is being selected so I didn’t mind it!

“We all have our scars, and not all of them are etched in our skin.” 

Summary: I find The Shadow of the Gods to be well written. The characters are well written and it is hard for me to choose a favorite because it kept changing. The world-building and writing are good but I would have appreciated a glossary to support all the new terminology. I loved the ending and I am of course going to continue the sequel which I believe will be even better!
