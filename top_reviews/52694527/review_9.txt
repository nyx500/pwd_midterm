I wasn't sure how I felt about this book for a while.The world was interesting, although I still wonder how anyone makes it to adulthood alive, the writing was fine, although it's one of those Fantasy book where half the words make you look at the glossary, and the characters were fine, although I didn't find myself that attached to them...There's definitely a lot of hype surrounding it and while I'm not as crazy as everyone else about it, the ending was great and I'm excited to learn more about the magic and the Gods in book 2!
