4.5 Great epic fantasy read! This has been on my shelf for months and one of my reading goals for this year was to branch out more with my fantasy reads and I am so glad I started with this one!! This book is set in a Norse inspired world and follows three different people on their journeys while navigating this world of old gods and new realities. There are warriors and witches and myths and magic. There are epic fights and battles. Triumphs and some heartbreak. This book started off a little bumpy for me bc of all the Nordic words and references but once I got past the first few chapters and got a hold of the lingo it was smooth sailing. There are some slower parts but it's mostly due to necessary world building. This book really unfolds itself to the reader which I loved as a writing style choice so much. There were a few surprises that I definitely didn't see coming!Orka is my absolute favorite character and I am bloodsworn to her now! I may or may not be going to look into viking style wkouts (if that's a thing) for my new gym regimen. ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™I can't wait to continue this series!!!
