This book is the very definition of EPIC! - and is currently the best book I've read all yearI can't even begin to tell you how much Shadow of the Gods blew me away! Hands down, it's one of the best Viking-inspired fantasies I've ever read. John Gwynne's epic storytelling, mind-blowing world-building, and incredibly unforgettable characters just sucked me in and never let go. It's been ages since I've read a book that made me feel so hooked on the story and so deeply invested in the characters. I haven't read the Faithful and the Fallen series yet, and it appears that that series is even better than this?!?! To which I ask one simple question. How?!World Building: 5/5Right from the start, Gwynne's world-building skills are off the charts, creating a brutal, blood-soaked world inspired by Norse mythology, as well as elements from Ragnarok and Beowulf. His descriptions of the landscape, the culture, and the daily life of the characters were so vivid and authentic that I felt like I was living in the world he'd built. Gwynne's talent for crafting a universe that's immersive and fantastical while still feeling grounded in reality is seriously impressive. The gods in this story, like Snaka (Snake, the father of gods), his sons—Ulfrir (Wolf), Berser (Bear), Rotta (Rat), Orna (Eagle) Lik-Rifa (Dragon)—and Oskutred, are super cool and clearly influenced by the Ragnarok-inspired world-building, which has a massive impact on the people and events in the story.A world filled with Norse Gods based on RagnarokOne of the most awesome aspects of the world-building is the blood system, which is central to the story. In this world, the Tainted - descendants of the gods' children - are kept as slaves in thrall collars, sold to the highest bidder as symbols of status and power. They each have hidden traits of their ancestor God, and the thrall collars help keep these powers under control, to be unleashed only at the direction of their owner.... We only get a taster of these powers in this book, and I can't wait to see what happens with them in the follow ups. 
"When you have lost everything, there is still something you can lose. Hope."
Story Telling: 5/5 As for the plot, Gwynne's storytelling chops are seriously next level. He masterfully weaves together multiple storylines, keeping you on the edge of your seat with every twist and turn. The pace of the story is non-stop, but he's got a talent for balancing it with moments of introspection and character development. It's like this wild rollercoaster of action, suspense, and epic battle scenes that keep you totally hooked and dying to know what happens next. The plot is intricate and well thought out, with each revelation and plot twist feeling earned and satisfying - with plenty of "No way's" and "are you kidding me's" being exclaimed by me at the end of chapters.
“Sometimes there are no choices. We are swept along in a current not of our own choosing… I will be the current. I will be the course.”
Characters: 5/5The characters in this book are seriously amazing, and I've gotta say, Orka is hands down my favourite. She's this strong, complex female lead who's super determined, loyal, and loves her family like crazy. It's her love for her family that drives her actions throughout the story, making her such a compelling character. Sure, she's a badass warrior with a sharp mind, but it's her vulnerability and humanity that make her feel so real and relatable. Varg, on the other hand, is this former thrall on a quest for vengeance for his slain sister. His journey is all about self-discovery, as he deals with his past and forms new bonds with his fellow mercenaries. Elvar, she's this ambitious young warrior, super eager to prove her worth and make a name for herself. Her character arc dives into themes of honor, duty, and the cost of ambition. Gwynne has this knack for making you care so much about these characters, like you're right there with them through all the ups and downs, the wins and losses. The supporting cast is also crazy well-developed, making the world feel even more real and alive. And I can't go without mentioning Svik - who is this humourous, wiley warrior. I found myself so emotionally invested in these heroes and just couldn't help but cheer them on every step of the way.Orka - a badass viking, out to find her son (Credit: John Wallin Liberto)
“Remember, we are Bloodsworn, bound to one another. Stand or fall, we are sworn to each other. That is our strength.”
Writing Style: 5/5Gwynne's prose is seriously amazing in this novel, with a super atmospheric and engaging writing style that paints a vivid picture of the harsh environment and the fierce battles happening in it. The writing just flows so effortlessly, making it easy to lose yourself in the story and feel the icy winds on your face, or hear the clash of steel against steel in the heat of battle. Gwynne's got this poetic yet raw style that really brings the characters and their world to life.And let me tell you, the build-up towards the epic ending is spot on. The tension and anticipation grow as the story moves forward, leading to a heart-pounding finale that will mean the last 100 pages or so just fly by. Maybe not quite as good as Sanderson, but still bloody great! Gwynne's also got this talent for balancing quieter, character-driven moments with high-stakes action, making for a wickedly captivating reading experience.
"The only thing worse than a lie is a half-truth. They are harder to kill and easier to swallow."
Enjoyment: 5/5 I can't emphasize enough how much I enjoyed this book. It was one of those rare reading experiences where everything just clicked, and I found myself utterly captivated by the story. I was so engrossed in the world and the characters that I blew through the book in just a day or two. With young kids (and therefore sleep deprivation) around, it's not often that a novel can hold my attention like this these days, but Shadow of the Gods had me eagerly flipping the pages, desperate to know what would happen next. In short, Shadow of the Gods is a total game-changer in the fantasy genre. If you're a fan of Viking-inspired stories and epic adventures, you've got to give this one a read. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!Final Rating: 5.0/5 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕
