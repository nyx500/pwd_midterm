Shadow of the Gods just hit 10,000 ratings!***Before the release of The Hunger of the Gods, I decided to listen to the beginning of The Bloodsworn Saga in the audiobook format for the first time. Colin Mace is great! A voice full of gravitas, with excellent narration that really effectively builds the tone and atmosphere. It is just so, SO AWESOME.***A glossary guide to the terminology used in The Shadow of the Gods - Shadow of the Gods Glossary GuideRelaxed interview with John (Papa) Gwynne - John Gwynne interview with The Brothers Gwynne***Okay. Okay. WellI'm speechlessThis book is honestly just incredible. INCREDIBLEThe grittiest John Gwynne book so far. The most realistic. The most amazing. There is honestly not a dull moment, because it is always tense and just shocking. I cannot wait for everyone else to read this next year. Add it to your lists, get a countdown, because this is not something you will be able to cope missing out on.
