In three words: heartfelt, dreamy, powerful."'There's no point in feeling guilty, or worrying about what may come. Put one foot before the other, and follow your path. That's all we can do.'"When I love the first book of a series, I sometimes worry about whether I'll like the second one as much; we're all familiar with 'second-book syndrome' and it's always a bit disappointing when a sequel ends up falling short of expectations. However, I can safely say that Marillier absolutely delivers with this second book in the Sevenwaters trilogy - I loved it even more than Daughter of the Forest! Son of the Shadows follows on some years after the end of book one, and it was so delightful to meet some new characters as well as hear from the ones I fell in love with in the first book. While I did love the new characters introduced here, I think my heart was slightly more taken with those in Daughter of the Forest. However, Marillier excels in writing heartfelt romance and she hit me right in the feels with this book. The slow burn of the romance was masterfully done, and a big plus for me was that this book was more action-packed than the first; I instantly felt swept up in the story. Marillier has such an effortless way of writing fantasy - it's truly storytelling of the purest, most powerful form.Recommended for: people wishing to read an utterly captivating second book in a fantasy series that I'm sure will become a firm favourite of mine. For excellent writing, characters and plot, I'd highly recommend reading Daughter of the Forest and then Son of the Shadows!~~~~~Review also posted here.
