An outstanding book that continues the story of the children of Sevenwaters, and another for my favourites shelf.The story of Sevenwaters continues with the children of Sorcha and Red. Whatever idyllic start Sevenwaters gives its children, they certainly are expected to shoulder more than their fair share of trial and difficulty as they grow up.Liadan demonstrates the same fortitude her mother displayed in Daughter of the Forest as she makes her way through a path of treachery and hurt in order to protect what she loves. The path she walks is only part of the story, however, and the road ahead remains filled with uncertainty and danger. This book fulfilled every expectation I had, delivering an amazing and richly imagined tale told with Marillier's trademark excellence and style.
