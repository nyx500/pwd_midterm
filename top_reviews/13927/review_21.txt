2 1/2 stars. After absolutely loving Sevenwaters part 1, I was really disappointed that this book turned out to be an unnecessary sequel that truly pales in comparison to the first book. The main problem is that Marillier simply rehashes many of the main plot points from the first book: We have a young girl whose skill in healing brings her to the attention of an enemy of her people. After spending time with this person, she falls in love with him and comes to realize that her people's enemy aren't savage barbarians after all. Since they are from warring factions, however, they have a heck of a time trying to be together. This description is equally true for book 1 and 2. Marillier simply took the skeleton of the first book and rewrote it. The second problem is that, where book 1 was a book about magic with a little romance, book 2 is all romance with a little magic. Witches, gods, shapeshifters, and curses take a back seat in this volume so that we can spend hundreds of pages watching a girl fawn over an emotionally distant tattoo enthusiast. Now, I have no problem with romance, but I feel like Marillier completely changed the focus of this series and that is a bit disingenuous. Luckily, the volumes in this series are only distantly related, with each volume following around the next generation, so I don't feel the need to rush into volume 3 like I did with volume 2.
