3.5 stars, leaning to 4. I enjoyed this 2nd book in the Sevenwaters series. This time, we follow Liadan, Sorcha's and Iubdan's (Hugh) daughter as the Fair folk meddle once again in the lives of the Sevenwaters clan. Liadan is a healer like her mother, and kind and forthright in her dealings with others. Liadan is a twin, with an older sister Niamh. Though not gorgeous like her older sister, Liadan has attracted the attention of Eamonn, the head of a neighbouring, important clan. Sorcha points out to Liadan that Liadan seems to be outside of the roles and rules of the Fair Folk's endeavours, which may allow her to make her own choices.It's several years after the action of book 1, and the Britons are still a concern, with Liadan's male relatives forging alliances to build a large enough force to push the Britons out. When Niamh's attention fixes on the wrong guy, all her male relatives gang up on her in a "blame, shame and defame" game that sends Niamh off with a much older husband. Where Sorcha's brothers seemed more sympathetic of Sorcha, all the Sevenwaters males seem to have become much more rigid and dictatorial in their attitudes. Their decision to sell Niamh's body off has long term negative consequences, which look to play out into book 3.I did not enjoy this book as much as book 1, probably because I spent much of my time annoyed or angry with Sevenwaters' men, who came off as obdurate to me. I also felt generally uncomfortable with a couple of the other male characters. That said, I did enjoy the writing, and I liked how determined and strong-willed Liadan was, holding out against her entire family when necessary.
