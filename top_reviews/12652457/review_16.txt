Yes, I loved the re-read of this one just as much as the previous two and I have already started book 4. Can't wait for the final one to come out as I forgot so many of the plot twists and the crazy amazing-ness which I now remember. I have to admit that I really think Weeks outdoes himself in this one and the next with the mind-bending magic and plot twists, they just keep on coming and I feel like I never know what may happen next, and yet he does tie things up well too!Overall, fantastic again and without trying to spoil things T and Kip are still my faves, I am glad Liv is a more minor character in this one, and seeing Gavin and Karis struggle to figure everything out is great. Also Ironfist and the White have some amazing conversations and moments in this book!5*s again!
