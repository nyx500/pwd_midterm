Wow. Just wow. It took me a long time to get to this point, but it was so worth it. I can't say much about the book itself because I would just have to mark the whole review as a spoiler, but what I will say is Erikson has truly created a masterpiece. Having so many characters and plot-lines makes it really difficult to tie together, and sometimes authors flop at the end or just never finish. Erikson is not one of those authors. He has one of the largest worlds, if not the largest, in fantasy fiction and yet he perfectly finishes this amazingly epic series.If you're reading this review and you haven't yet started Malazan, now is the time to jump into Erikson's vast and beautiful world. Starting Gardens of the Moon is a daunting task: a huge book that is super confusing with 9 more super huge books to follow. I'm here to tell you that it is all worth it. This book, and this series, now proudly sits at the top of my favourites list and will likely not move from its position.
