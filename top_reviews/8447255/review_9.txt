Simple review. If you have gotten this far you do not need an introduction. If you have made it this far then you do not want me to spoil the plot. People have analysed that the ending of the series is weak. I completely disagree. This is up there with Deadhouse Gates, Memories Of Ice and Midnight Tides. Everything is written perfectly. Poetic. I cared about all the point of view characters. Even the storylines I did not care about too much in the prior instalment Dust Of Dreams, such as the Shake come to fruition here and you understand the necessity for the journey. You need to just read it. There are so many great scenes combining a huge amount of the big players that we have been following over what is a span of about ten years in this saga. Characters meet each other again after say 8-9 books apart and some of those moments are heart-wrenching. You will know the points when you get to them. There are so many amazing stand out dramatic scenes. A lot of the plots are wrapped up but you will still leave with so many questions. Ublula and Draconus are up there with Tehol and Bugg for their comedy gold. Forget this review. Just read this is you haven't already. Fiction especially fantasy will not compare to me anymore. I feel like part of my life is over now completing it. Take care all. Peace x.www.youandibooks.wordpress.com
