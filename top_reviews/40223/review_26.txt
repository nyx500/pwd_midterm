Annnnndddd... My heart is full. 😭♥️ This is the last book in Phèdre’s trilogy so I won’t mention any specifics of the plot, but be warned that if you thought the first two books were dark, this one is even more so (TW include slavery, child slavery, rape).I will admit that my brain has not been the best at focusing for the last two weeks or so, so although there were plenty of moments where I did get swept up in the story, there were also points where I think the details were lost on me. 😅 But that’s OK - I’ll definitely reread this trilogy at some point! I love these characters too much not to.Because Carey has based her world on ours (but in a historical fantasy sense), it makes it very easy to imagine the different settings! In Kushiel’s Avatar we visit more countries outside of Phèdre’s homeland, Terre d’Ange (like Renaissance France), and it’s so interesting to see it all through her eyes. It’s easy to forget that travelling in a fantasy or historical setting isn’t as simple as hopping on a plane! There is a lot of travelling in this book, but for the most part I wasn’t bored because the characters and their stories kept me gripped. There were so many little scenes that touched my heart so deeply. 🥺
