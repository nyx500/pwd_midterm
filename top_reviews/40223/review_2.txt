Although I did enjoy the first two books in this series, it was with a bucket of reservations: repetition, overblown language, and inadequate characterization of the supporting characters, which made the impressively plotted political machinations so much less involving.The third book, however, overturned most of these. There is still repetition (I will own, if I ever hear that phrase again I will go mad), but the high-flown language comes into its own describing the lengthy journey undertaken by Phedre and co. The thinly veiled copy of our world almost seems like a whole new fantasy land.There is some dark unpleasantness in the middle of the book that felt like a step too far for me - significantly beyond what occurred in earlier books. I didn't like it, but it was somewhat redeemed when it proved to be integral to the plot.Above all, as other reviewers found, the more personal and philosophical nature of this book and the characters' motivations made it a much more enjoyable read. In particular, the development of the relationship between Imriel, Phedre and Joscelin was moving and genuine, and gave a satisfying conclusion to the series.
