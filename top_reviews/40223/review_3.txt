2021 update: My first (but definitely not last) reread of this trilogy is complete. And I love it as much now as I ever did.————————————Five well earned stars. A beautiful end to a fantastic trilogy.
I prayed it would end in love. I prayed we could come home, all of us.
I love Phèdre nó Delaunay de Montrève. Wholeheartedly, her story and her character have captivated me. She is loving, brave, and compassionate, devoted completely to the people she loves, with a deep code of honor. A vow from her is worth more than gold. Knowledge is precious to her, and she learns all she can. She is also vain, suspicious, and stubborn. Phèdre is one of the most beautiful, complex, fully-realized fantasy heroines that I have ever had the pleasure of reading.I love old-fashioned, unexpectedly humorous, "protect and serve" Joscelin. I love Imriel, Ysandre, Nicola, Kaneka, Favrielle, and Quintillus Rousse. Even after everything, I still love Melisande. I don't think I could not.
I had killed a man, murdered his trust, taken his life. If I had to do it again, I would. I believe that. Still, I could not forget. Should not forget.
Kushiel's Avatar dips its characters into the depths of hell. There is hardly a character who emerges unscathed, physically or emotionally. The cruelty and brutality seem overwhelming. Phèdre herself questions Kushiel. Surely, somethings are too much to bear. But there's also unimaginable joy, hope, and love. Positivity and beauty practically radiate from the pages. There's a future. By the end, I was crying happy tears.I have nitpicks. The endless traveling was a bit repetitive and exhausting after a while. It definitely needed more Favrielle and her sass. But what is comes down to is that I don't want to criticize this. This has been one of the best fantasy trilogies, with the best heroine, that I've read. All my nitpicks matter little in comparison.
