How can a series with prose this purple and a premise this absurd be so gripping? All three of these books have kept me up reading late into the night. Purple or no, Carey’s writing is engaging; and somehow I completely buy into the idea that a prostitute with a heart of gold can use her astonishing beauty and hardcore masochism to save the world.In this conclusion to the trilogy, Phèdre seeks nothing less than the Name of God, which she needs to free her friend who was trapped on an island by an angry angel in the first book. She travels the world looking for it (a significant part of these books is travelogue, giving us a glance at Carey's intriguing alternate history) and along the way she undertakes to rescue the child of her greatest enemy.The section in the middle where she’s imprisoned in the hellish harem is absolutely nauseating, and I’m grateful the author skimmed over most of the details.The next trilogy focuses on the rescued child, Imriel, and I hope those books are as good as these first three.
