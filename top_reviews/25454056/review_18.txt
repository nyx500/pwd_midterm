Chaos is aggression, Order is protection against it.
Still awesome! I was so scared this won't live up to the first book/novellas but I was wrong, I so do not agree with most folks on this, this book is as good as The Last Wish, some characters like Dandelion and Yennefer that was introduced in that novella made more appearances here. Not to mention Ciri the child of promise, I cannot wait to see what happens in the next book.Just like the first book this book is written jn Geralt's narrative, I really loved the novella that Geralt met Ciri and the one with the doppler, I really felt bad for the creature, to be hated for something you can't change sucks. I just have one issue with one of the stories  Sacrifice everyone's hair was been ruffled by the wind it was so annoyingly repetitive.
In the morning each of them was going to go their own way; in search of something they already had. But they did not know they had it, they could not even imagine it. They could not imagine where the roads they were meant to set off on the next morning would lead. Each of them travelling separately.
The world building and writing is as great as that of the first book, I hope this continues as I start the initial series.
‘Then tell him… Tell him to dry up!’‘What did she say?’‘She told you,’ the Witcher translated, ‘to go drown yourself.’
