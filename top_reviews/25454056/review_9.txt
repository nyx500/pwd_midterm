“There is never a second opportunity to make a first impression.”

The Last Wish ★★★★Sword of Destiny ★★★★I am quite happy that I enjoyed those two books before the main series, I mean usually short story collections don’t work for me for some reason but those ones did and those introduced the characters so now it will be easier to read the main series!I do think that “The Last Wish” is better structure wise from Sword of Destiny but I still enjoyed this one very lot. The main reason was that I watched the first season of the Witcher and as a visual person, it made my life much easier when I read this book. I already know the characters and their motives and how they look and some of the stories were adapted already so I flew through them.As I said above, usually short stories don’t work for me because the books are condensed with those, maybe 10-12 of those in a 300-400 pages book which means they are very short stories and I feel there is never enough time to tell a story in an appropriate way. The good thing in this series that they were a bit longer which gives time to connect to the story.I won’t be discussing each story alone here but I am gonna say what is the common thing I liked about all of them and what could have been better! I like Geralt and Yen and Dandelion, I feel it is easy to connect to their stories wherever the setting is. I think the plot lines were interesting but I felt that most of the endings were rushed somehow, I mean I enjoy the build up but usually the end result is unsatisfactory and the story ends with the shortest chapter!

“Our world is in equilibrium. The annihilation, the killing, of any creatures that inhabit this world upsets that equilibrium. And a lack of equilibrium brings closer extinction; extinction and the end of the world as we know it.”

I think I need to mention that the translator did a very good job and translator efforts usually go unnoticed but I think that would not be fair here. Another thing I should mention is that Sapkowski has the typical white male voice of fetishizing women and describing their round heavy breasts *face palm* which I understand for a book published in 1992 but I don’t quite like! I hope the later books are better in that aspect!Summary: I did like this collection of short stories more than I expected given that they are usually books that don’t work for me. I liked the plot lines, the characters and mythology, I kind of felt underwhelmed by the endings and by the female descriptions. I am still looking for the main trilogy which I hope to start later this year!
