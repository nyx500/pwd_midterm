I read this book in swedish (called Ödets Svärd - Sword of Destiny) and let me just say;WOW. Sapkowski, you f-ing rule.Everything about this book is awesome, from the characters to the world, to the humor and the fighting scenes. Geralt is a true badass, although he tries not to act like one. And his, kind of tragic, love story with Yennefer really gets to you. (unless you are a ghoul or something, and then Geralt will find you and destroy you.)So, if you haven't yet read any Andrzej Sapkowski, do it now. Yesterday if you could. You wont regret it.
