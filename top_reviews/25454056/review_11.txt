4 STARS, destined for great things ★★★★✩


This book is for you if… high fantasy with room for humour and modernised language suits your tastes. Be prepared for a lot of angsty romance and badass fighting scenes.
⤐ Preface.Can we please, collectively, complain to Netflix for taking off The Witcher soundtrack of Spotify? I literally need to listen to Toss a coin to your witcher until I shout it from my grave. UPDATE: It seems our collective karening has helped. I've not only enjoyed the original, but also this amazing cover by the incredibly talented Orletta Vicover⤐ Overall.Different from The Last Wish in its style of adventures but still very enjoyable, this collection of short stories is less a sequence of cases, as was the previous book, but more of a deep dive into what shape and traits Geralt's character has, which is very useful considering I've not read the following books or played the game.A close up on the witcher characters is the unofficial title of Sword of Destiny book, I swear! It was very enjoyable to remeet with the men and women I came to love in The Last Wish. They are now a bit less of a mystery and more like old friends to me.World(-building). It was more of a world deepening in my experience. The political dynamics became a bit clearer, as did the ethnic diversity which leads to an overall improved understanding of the world.The arch of suspense. Hmm [in Henry Cavill's voice].Some of the stories were really exciting and others kinda had me skimming the pages for dialogue. This is probably my biggest point of critique. Still a page-turner overall.You will find me in bed, inhaling the entire Witcher Season. Oh, and harassing both Netflix and Spotify on Twitter, for obvious reasons.⤐ What’s happening.

‘Doubts. Only evil, sir, never has any. But no one can escape his destiny.’

Whether he knows it or not, Geralt of Rivia is getting closer to his fate with every step he takes in this unusual but enlightening collection of short stories. Dragons, mermaids, dopplers and dryads, this book challenges him in very untypical ways.
Con:⇢ the monsters are getting bigger⇢ destiny has fangs, not feathers⇢ incompetent morons everywherePro:⇢ more dandelion⇢ more yennefer⇢ more angsty romance
