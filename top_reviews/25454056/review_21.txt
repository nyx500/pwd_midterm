This is the second prequel short story collection that begins The Witcher series.Like the former anthology, this follows Witcher, Geralt. Unlike the former anthology it largely deviates from detailing his work and the many beasts, creatures, and magical beings that roam these lands, and instead focuses on more personal topics, including his relationships with women and his preoccupation with one female in particular.I found I appreciated the contents of this one less as it did not contain the scenes of magic and bloodshed that I was anticipating but it was interesting to get to know this elusive witcher a little better. I also loved how, just like in The Last Wish, the stories were interconnected to make a chronological history of Geralt's life. I think I'm ready to move onto the full works in this series, now though.
