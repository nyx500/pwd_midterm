Five years of blood, sweat, tears, and cliffhangers later, the journey has finally come to an end... Well, where to begin. This book ended perfectly. Beautifully. But (there's always a but), it could have been fifty or even a hundred pages shorter. I felt like there was so much exposition with little pay off with too much telling and not showing. ex: "10 days later, Laia did this, 2 weeks later, Elias did that,".....I felt like there were handfuls of 'empty' spaces within the book where characters would rest, talk, meet up, leave on a journey, and meet up again to fight, escape, repeat. But overall, spending time with them before the end was bittersweet. This book did not hold back the knife on killing certain characters. The final battle was a whirlwind of tension and throughout the entire time, holding my breath; literally living through the infamous phrase: I let a breath I didn't know I was holding.In the end, I'm glad I know these broken brittle characters- their strength and weaknesses, their stories, this world.....I'm sad to leave it but looking ahead with more wonder, a fond heart, and lighter spirits, than before I began this harrowing journey. 4 STARSTwitter | Bookstagram | Youtube |
