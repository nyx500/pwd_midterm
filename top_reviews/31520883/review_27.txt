❝
What a small thing it seems, to walk with the one you love. To look forward to a day with them. I marvel at the simplicity of this moment. And I thank the skies for the miracle of it.
❞finishing this series was so heartwarming and bittersweet and also heartbreaking all at once. when i first read an ember in the ashes three years ago, it reignited my love for reading and was one of the books that really back into reading again. i absolutely fell in love with the world, laia, elias and everything else. needless to say, it's one of the series closest to my heart, along with it's flaws. my favourite is still and will always be the first book. there was just something so compelling about the way it was written. the characters that i initially fell in love with were so different in this one. elias will still be my fave even though his character arc kinda broke me :) would confirm that i'll still let him step on me and thank him for it. and the way every book just slowly got more sad and dark, bye😔😭 while reading a sky beyond the storm, i shed teARSSS (which i rarely do tbh) and what i can say is, the end scene was all i ever wanted :') laia becoming a tribe's kehanni when she said in the first book that she wanted to be that since she was a child??? thAT was everything uGHHGHGHSJFKS. when i read that it was the moon festival boYY i was about to tear up because we came such a long way from the first moon festival. aaand just realized i won't ever be able to write a critical and coherent review with all my thoughts about this so imma just rate it and goooo 👉🏾my messy emo thoughts right after finishing:i truly have no idea what i did to deserve this series. my heart was broken into pieces and then put together and i'm being SO dramatic here but idk what i'm going to do rn. forever going to love sabaa tahir ofc because this kind of changed me as a person and i'm going to go now because it's 3am and i might just start rambling/crying so yeah :')__________________________________waiting for this to save/ completely change the face of my 2020 for the better
