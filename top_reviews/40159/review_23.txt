Buddy read with my girls at Buddies, Books, & Baubles.I kept putting off starting this one. I think it was because I just couldn't warm to Attolia, at all, so I wasn't sure I'd enjoy this book. I'm so happy that I was dead WRONG!I was hooked my the second chapter & started binge reading until 3 in the morning. I couldn't figure Gen's motives for most of the book. I only knew he wanted to be underestimated. I didn't understand what he was doing with Costis beyond securing the Captain of the Guard. I mean, it didn't earn him any loyalty. I was in the dark about Attolia & Gen, what was going on? I LOVE BEING KEPT GUESSING! This is my most favoritest book evah in The Queen's Thief series. Excellent plotting and storytelling. I put these books on both my middle grade and young adult shelves, it's hard to believe they're classified as middle grade. Megan Whalen Turner made it onto my favorite authors shelf, that woman can write! I very highly recommend this series. Most of my GR friends rated the first book lower than the rest. I was opposite, I rated the second book slightly lower because Attolia was hard for me to appreciate. I still feel a bit like I don't know her. Gen is such an excellent, intriguing character, he could carry the series alone if he had to. I think I'd probably laugh harder at his antics if I reread the first book, The Thief, knowing his secrets. When he gets his master-thief-mojo on, he's stinkin' incredible! His grandfather was not wrong when he said that a thief's greatest weapon is his mind!I want to know if Sophos is alright. I loved him in the first book and really want him and Eddis to make each other happy. Please, don't let him be dead.
