An awesome, awesome book! Sweet revenge. When you have a protagonist so much superior mentally and physically than anyone else, yet was taken as a fool and belittled by everyone, it was the COOLEST thing to see him finally reveal his true self, making everyone realize they'd been played all along. Turner was a genius. Her intelligence and imagination made Eugenides a truly brilliant character. "...if Attolia could look like a queen, then Eugenides was like a god revealed...". Furthermore, Turner made the story that much more interesting by telling it from a third party point of view. The illusion and misconception at the beginning; the subsequent intrigues; and finally the awe, everything was revealed gradually. I was giddy with anticipation reading and guessing Eugenides's maneuvers. I'd had such negative feeling about cutting off Eugenides's hand in the last book that I didn't believe the series and the romantic relationship could recover from that. However, in this book, everything made sense, their relationship flourished. I actually felt Eugenides's losing one hand was essential to the story's perfection. Not many authors could've pulled this off and Turner did it beautifully.Last but not least, the book is a perfect example of "show, not tell". Nothing was told outright to the readers, everything was observed through other people's eye, yet we still got a clear picture of the characters and felt close to them. It was in turn heartwarming, sweet, and heartbreaking, while the story always absorbing. A solid, deserving 5-star.
