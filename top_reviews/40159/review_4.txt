Definitely not as dark as the last book.I loved the tone of this one. You get an almost playful heist vibe this time around. And there's a build-up toward what you know will end in Gen having pulled something over on...someone?And it doesn't disappoint.I don't think that's at all a spoiler because Gen is Gen and there's no way anyone who has read the previous books is going to fall for him being a complete stooge. The question is how much of what he's doing is real and how much Gen is playing everyone around him.  The basic gist of this one (without giving any spoilers) is that Gen is having to deal with becoming the King of Attolia when everyone in Attolia hates his guts. Partially because he is the Thief of Eddis but mainly because they all think that he forced their beloved queen into this marriage. Everyone from his own attendants to the palace cooks is out to get him - in big ways and in small irritating ways.Can Gen win over an entire nation? <-- so he can help his beloved Queen rule her peopleOr at the very least win over the palace guards? <--so he doesn't get shanked in the gardens  This. was. excellent.I loved it from start to finish.Highly Recommended.
