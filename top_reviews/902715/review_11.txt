A masterful follow-up that leaves the reader ravenous for the final bookThis book is absolutely wonderful, and somehow improves upon the first book which was a great first entry in this series. The first series suffered from a few too many different POVs that didn't interconnect, but this one feels tighter with three main storylines.It's rare to read a book that fully commits to making every single character a "bad guy" in their own way. The writer didn't fall for the temptation of making a good guy that feels unrealistic in the world that's been painted. Instead, this world feels dark, gritty, and extremely real. It feels somehow like a more impressive A Song of Ice and Fire, which is almost blasphemous for me to say considering I absolutely adore that series and have read it multiple times. I am entirely confident that the third book is going to blow me away and make this series one of the all-time greats. Joe Abercrombie has absolutely knocked this one out of the park, and he rightfully deserves all the praise he has received over the years.If you are a fan of fantasy with darker elements, just stop whatever you are reading and pick up The First Law trilogy. You can thank me later.
