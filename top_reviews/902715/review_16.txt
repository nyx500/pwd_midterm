Full video review here: https://youtu.be/OVr28iuVqhAOk Goodreads, I ACTUALLY finished the book this time. I don't know what the hell is wrong with you for just randomly marking books read, you lunatic. Anyway, this book kicks ass. Everything I enjoyed about The Blade Itself was expanded on and knocked out of the park in this sequel. This was a massive step up from an already solid start to the First Law trilogy. The characters were more intriguing and there was definitely a lot more plot movement in this one.Glokta is far and away one of the best fantasy characters I've read in quite some time. He is such a loveable bastard and Joe Abercrombie has done excellent work here. Pacey's audiobook narration also brings him to life in a way I didn't know was possible. I also love how the world of First law really shows you that there's always someone worse than the person you are reading about. Logen Ninefingers was more interesting here as well and is an absolute badass. That one scene though, you know the one, I'm not sure I needed lmao. "I told you it's been a while."Jezal is still as insufferable as ever but in an entertaining way. All I kept thinking of is this is a whinier/more pathetic version of Adolin from the Stormlight Archive. I'm curious to see where his story goes from here. I loved learning more about Ferro and spending more time with her and the same goes for the Dogman. They are both intriguing in their own rights. Collen West also has a lot going on. Basically what I'm saying is these characters are at the center of this series and they are fantastic. I can't wait to read book 3!
