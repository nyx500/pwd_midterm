I've been enjoying this series but less so with book 2.I still love Glokta, there were some strong moments (West pushing the Prince down the cliff was particularly satisfying.) but the story didn't grip me as much.Anyone else felt like the sex scene were... kinda gross?Will continue and see how I feel after book 3.
