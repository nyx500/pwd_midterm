What can I say that others haven't already? It's Abercrombie; it's excellent, stairs are a constant enemy, the mud welcomes all into its embrace. Again I want to stress these are characters that you take with you and mentally keep around; they are near and dear companions even when you aren't reading it. This is a world that doesn't feel like you're on a railroad ride. It's a living, breathing world that sucks you in and makes you want to stay there. Our plot further thickens now that the stage is set in the first book. This tale contains much more action, twists, and turns, and unlikely deaths, friendships, and lovers happen along the way. If you like dark fantasy, just read this series already. I highly doubt you'll be disappointed. Say one thing about Abercrombie; say he's an unbelievable writer that grabs you and doesn't let go until he's done with you.
