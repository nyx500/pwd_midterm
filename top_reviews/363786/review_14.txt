One of the most heart-breaking stories of all time.ðŸ’– I'm pretending I haven't already read the entire series, up to Book # 9. I'll also ignore all the villains. They aren't worth my time and energy. The finale of the trilogy had to be one of the most imaginative, complex, captivating, haunting, and yes, heart-break stories I've ever read and loved. Daemon broke my heart over and over. His love for Jaenelle was beyond measure. Sharing this scene with my tears flowing:

"I want you to promise me something.""Anything."Her eyes filled with tears. . . "Thirteen years ago you gave everything you had in order to help me.""And I'll give you everything again,". . ."No. No more sacrifices, Daemon. Not from you. That's what I want you to promise. . . The Keep is going to be the only safe place. . . you must get to the Keep before dawn. Promise me, Daemon. . . I have to know you'll be safe. Promise me." . . . "I'll not going to do anything that will make me late for my own wedding. . . I'll come back to you, . . . I swear it."
That wasn't how things happened.
