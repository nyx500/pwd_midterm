May 2020:Went through the book again (with some skimming so I am not counting it). Lots of fun but this is probably the weakest 2nd half of the trilogy. I loved the first half - the romance between Janelle and Daemon is fantastic- but the resolution to the climatic battle in the end was a bit of the cop out. Thankfully some crazy OTT drama with Daemon saved the book. Is it weird that I find this book fun, given its level of violence? There is something addictive about the writing.
