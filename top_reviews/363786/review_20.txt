Finally, all the children are grown up. Well, as grown up as they can be. They are a force to be reckon with and yet, they are still held back. Some die which just break my heart. Usually, I'm okay with characters dying or getting hurt, but I feel like I've watched all of these characters grow up and to watch them die just kills me. This is the final show down. Witch will now bring war to all the rotten. Lorn is finally revealed. Are we surprised? I'm not surprised. The fact that the others never guessed, I'm disbelieving. Regardless, I do have to say, I cried in this story. When the war is over, I cried for Daemon. And how those ungrateful brats were cold to Daemon. How could they? Bastards. This was a lovely ending to this trilogy. I have my happily ever after even if it is slightly bittersweet.
