Update 2023- This is an addendum to my original review. To 'new to this series' readers, please note that this does not end as a trilogy as first advertised. As of last year, this is a 12 (or more)-book series, including short stories/novellas books. And be aware that there will be some surprises with books 9 and 10! This is one of the most emotional novels I have ever read. Remember that these novels, and more importantly this trilogy, borders, if not leaps over the border at times, of horror.Jaenelle finally decides she has had enough of the horrific murders, sadism, and cruelty that the realms are going through via Dorothea and Hekatah and finds a way to do something about it. Unfortunately, not everyone will understand precisely WHY she has to do it this particular way.As I said, at times, this is a gut-wrenching horror read, and other times, it is a love story that will make you weep...a lot!Again this is written quite richly -if I had any complaints, it would be that the backstory is sometimes pulled out a little too much for me. Perhaps, this little quirk would not annoy me if I had not read this when all the books were in place.
