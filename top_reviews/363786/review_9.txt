I have nothing against guilty pleasures, or the r-rated themes, but there was no pleasure anywhere unfortunately. The characters are as flat as pancakes. There's no action. Why does anyone fall in love with each other? Who knows! They just do! Even when the heroes throw out ways to stop the upcoming war the heroine/author retorts that the war will be kept fighting by the enemy because - there is no reason. Just because! Because it was started! The two main villains plan about 5 evil schemes and all of them are foiled in 2 seconds flat. We keep hearing how sadistic the the main love interest is and there's nothing of the sort. In fact he's just poor misunderstood dude who people keep saying is capable of horrible things, why? Who knows. Because the auther has the characters say so. There's one incident where he kills a woman who was torturing him. Not virtuous but hardly sadistic. The book isn't even that graphic, so if you're looking for eroticism it's not here. The heroine's family constantly misunderstands her for no discernible reason except to give her some more angst. One good thing was when the main couple finally had sex it wasn't the giant cheese fest I expected it to be.And besides the plot, just plain repetitive writing, repeating the same things and the same words over and over again.Like others have said, if you're looking for books like this go with the Kushiel series by Jaqueline Carey. And if you've already read that and are looking for more like that don't go with this.
