Some days it seems like hardly any of my childhood dreams came true.I never grew up to have Lynda Carter's cleavage:I never grew up to be a sassy black woman with an afro, like my childhood idol, Willona Woods, from Good Times:And I never (no matter how many times I tried) learned to fly or to move objects around with my eyes.But, somehow, Roald Dahl knew about these childhood dreams. Knew that kids want to have a magical bustline, rare hair, or powerful eyes that make evildoers pay for their bad behavior.And it's this ability, combined with his fantastic writing and humor, that makes his books what they are.A third read of Matilda this week did not disappoint. Roald Dahl always gets it, and never gets old for me.
