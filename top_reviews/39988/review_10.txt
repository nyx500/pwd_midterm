I have short-changed this story by giving it 3 stars for so long. I ran out and bought this book for my little nieces for Christmas. No way they will grow up without Matilda in their life.

I can't wait to share her with them.8/28/17 Listening to this for the third time...I just adore Kate Winslet's narration.
