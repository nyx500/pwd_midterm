Middle of the road middle grade.That best describes this reading experience for me, which was a huge bummer. Someone I follow gushed about this book and how "magical" it was...and it just didn't live up to those expectations for me, sadly.In fact, this read like a book that was trying too hard to be the next big movie franchise. A lot of the elements of the book felt very choppy and very clearly borrowed from other huge blockbusters, i.e., Harry Potter (obviously), The Hunger Games, Mary Poppins and The Wizard of Oz, to name just a few. Full disclosure, though: the fact that I read this on the heels of my FIRST read of Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban (my first read of the HP series ever in general) probably didn't help matters any. All that said, while the story didn't blow me away, I DID enjoy it well enough. The main character, Morrigan, read pretty flat for me this go-round; but, I really liked Jupiter North and Hawthorne Swift and I will still read the next one to find out what happens. And who knows, maybe I will like this better upon a second read when I'm prepping for book two.
