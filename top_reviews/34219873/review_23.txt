I enjoyed this book. I liked Morrigan as a character, she’s very charming. As always, there’s a villain and the good, and there are many messages while she’s going through the trials. The writing was quite good. Townsend made the story very exciting, very action packed. The world is described in detail that was very enjoyable to read. The side characters were even very well thought through.If you’re going to pick up a middle grade book to enjoy your time and get lost in a magical world with a cute character, it's a good choice. Somehow when I read this first, I was more excited about it. But, as time passed, I realised I didn't care for the sequel that much. So, maybe on reflection, I didn't find it that memorable.
