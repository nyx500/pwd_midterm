You know what this means?
MORE WILL HERONDALE!
Update: First review for this book. Claiming it! (27/03/13)Edit 10/05/15 Since writing this review I've fallen out of love with Clare's novels, and in fact most novels I used to love (*shakes fist* "curse you, maturity!"), but I'm strangely proud that this semi-positive review is one of the top liked reviews amongst all these nasty reviewers... Seriously, why are you wasting your time with such redundant commentary? If I'd created a world as expansive as Clare's of-fucking-course I'D like to write about it as much as I can!!So boo on you fellas. Don't buy the books, save a tree, & save us from your bitterness ( ˘ ³˘)♥
