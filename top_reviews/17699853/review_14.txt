4.5 stars! How does Cassandra Clare always find new and painful ways to keep characters apart?üò≠‚ù§Ô∏èI haven't read a book in the shadow hunter universe in YEARS (probably like 8+ years which makes me feel old), so I was SO EXCITED to get back into the shadow hunter world, and I was not disappointed. I LOVE our main character Cordelia. She is brave, bold, and would do anything for her friends. I also love James and his whole group of friends. They would all walk straight into danger to protect people and do what's right. We get a big cast of characters. And I loved reading about all of their relationships with each other and their romances. Overall a fast-paced plot in a fun world.
