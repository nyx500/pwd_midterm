JEEZ!!! My heart stopped beating when I saw this cover. It's so gorgeous I want to marry it. <333___________________________I've been dying to read more about James Herondale ever since I read "The Midnight Heir" in "The Bane Chronicles". I love all those Herondales and Carstairs and Lightwoods and Blackthorns. Gosh just give me all those awesome Shadowhunters! I need them like I need air to breathe! <333I genuinely hope Cassie Clare never stops to write those books because it certainly would be the death of me. *lol*
