Sandersonitis...I've gots it!Mind Blowing This book Obliterated everything I thought I knew about Sanderson. I thought I knew his tricks...I thought I knew what he's going to do, I even sent theories to Robin, and in the end I've learned to just let shit flow the way they should. Just let Sanderson take over my life and give me amazing stories. Now, when this book started, it started with a bang! Running, running...YEAH YEAH YEAH! Then things changes and I was thinking...What are you doing Sanderson? Why are you changing things on me...I don't want this..what is this fuckery? Then BAM! And BOOM! My mind was blown. I can't give anymore because then it will spoil this book, seriously spoil this book. But one theory that I had came to life and I NEED BOOK THREE to see WHAT HAPPENS!!! This is the only review I can give for now..I need to go through my notes and really think about what to write.
