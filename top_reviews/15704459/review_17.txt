"I needed to say something. Something romantic! Something to sweep her off her feet."You’re like a potato!" I shouted after her. "In a minefield."She froze in place." Aaaand I'll leave to you the possibility to find out by yourself what this could possibly mean because it's so cute and -unbelievably- romantic, that honestly I don't have the heart to steal this pleasure from you. •It's Sanderson, it's good. With some authors it just works this way and you just know it. Plot is good, pace is good, characters are fantastic, and you're happy like a kid on Christmas day. Especially if it's December 22nd. Oh yeah. •And don't get me started on Sanderson's blessed plot-twists: they give you all the feels. And specifically, one of them made me realize how wonderful a person David is because I, in his shoes, would have gone berserk and killed everyone in no time. He really is kind and good-hearted, it's not simply a façade or an ostentation on his part, and that may have moved me a little. Being a horrible person, of course, my ideal flawed (not that David is Mr. Perfect or anything; he is flawed, just in other ways) and dark-ish protagonist would have slaughtered a person or two, and I still can't wrap my mind around how someone could not unleash his rage at least a little bit in a situation like that, but my not understanding was precisely what allowed me to appreciate David's characterization even more. •The fifth star is missing because, though fabulously and adorably entertaining, the book is still not as mind-blowing as Sanderson's books get. I want a breathtaking, heart-stopping conclusion, and if some thought-provoking stuff can be thrown in there too, I'd be in paradise, thank you. Now bring on Calamity.
