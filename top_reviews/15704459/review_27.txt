4 STARS
So Firefight! Indeed, the star in this book is Firefight, besides David himself:“And a figure of pure white light exploded into existence ... . It blazed like the sun itself, a feminine figure, radiant, powerful, golden hair blown back and shining like a corona.”I enjoyed the book a lot. And probably I would have rated it higher if it had the luck to not be my first read after Golden Son. Alas, it had no such luck! The start of the book is a bit slow and some of the things felt forced but nevertheless it’s a very good sequel to Steelheart. There is a refreshing change of setting from Newcago to Babylon Restored(old Manhattan). Really?! I want to know how Sanderson came up with this name. :) The author is grand at world building and I always enjoy super settings, especially well written ones. We meet and laugh with interesting new characters, members of the Reckoners team. We learn new technology and fight new dangerous Epics along with David. The book picks up its momentum after the 50% mark and the last third is full of action and suspense following David from one crisis to the next. My favorite parts of the book are the moments where David and Megan are together. And the Calamity scene! I won't tell much because spoilers ... .I'm looking forward to more exciting revelations in Calamity and a good conclusion to the trilogy!
