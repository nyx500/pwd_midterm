Wow! This is what I call super duper AMAZING read!YA science fiction/dystopian is not a genre I normally read. It's probably because I rarely find books that enthrall me like ones in this series have done. This is the second installment in The Reckoners trilogy and I found it was as good as the first one, or perhaps even better. The story delivered exactly what it promised. I had a hard time putting it down. The story grabbed me from the beginning and I was personally happy with the ending which was such a great surprise. I was left completely awestruck after finishing the book.David's nerdy personality still made me smile and chuckle. Despite the fact that he's sometimes too impulsive, careless, and a bit crazy, he keeps amazing me with his bravery and intelligence for the most part. Did I already mention how awesome the ending was? By the way, I did very much enjoy reading this book. Now I really want to know what will happen next!
