Kings of the Wyld is a rollicking, page-turning, edge-of-your-seat road trip of a book. Great characters, loveable rogues that I genuinely cared about and all manner of fantastical monsters. All spiced with a sly sense of humour that had me smiling throughout.I read Kings of the Wyld a few years ago now and absolutely adored it. Since then, two of my boys have joined the bandwagon and also loved this story. In the time that has passed I still fondly remember the wonderful band of characters that Nicholas Eames created. In my mind that is the mark of a great book.Definitely one of the best reads of mine in recent years. It is a fun and serious story essentially driven by friendship that is written in an effective and powerful way. I think one of the many things that makes this book distinctive is that not only fantasy readers will enjoy it, but I believe that many who do not frequently delve into the genre will also gain a lot from Kings of the Wyld.â€œAmong them is a renegade king, he who sired five royal heirs without ever unzipping his pants. A man to whom time has imparted great wisdom and an even greater waistline, whose thoughtless courage is rivalled only by his unquenchable thirst."It was so funny and hilarious, but what set it apart for me was its character and heart.A full 5/5 stars from me.
