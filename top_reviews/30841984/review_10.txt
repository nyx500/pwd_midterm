The best comedic fantasy book I've ever read! If you want a hilarious rollicking romp of a fantasy book, do yourself a favour and go and read this book!Final Rating: 4.7/5  ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•This is a book that takes the classic quest narrative and turns it on its head with a healthy dose of irreverence and humour. Imagine a world where mercenary bands are like rock stars, complete with groupies, tour buses, and a die-hard fanbase. Add to that a cast of characters that are as flawed as they are endearing, and you've got the recipe for a book that's both hilarious and heartfelt.The book follows the story of Clay Cooper, a retired mercenary who is drawn back into the fray when he learns that his old bandmate, the famed Gabriel, is in trouble. Along with a motley crew of fellow mercenaries, Clay sets out on a quest to save his friend and restore his band, Saga, to their former glory.
World-Building: 4.5/5
The book's setting is a land called Grandual, which is a sprawling and diverse continent full of all manner of landscapes, kingdoms, and creatures. From the vast forests of the Heartwyld to the frozen tundra of the North, the world of Kings of the Wyld feels like you've been plopped straight into a old school classic rpg - nostalgic to the core.One of the key features of the world-building is the existence of "bands," which are groups of mercenaries who travel the land and take on various quests and missions. Each band has its own reputation and history, many of whom parallel the stories and names of rock bands of the 1960's, 70's and 80's. By taking down the various wyverns, basilisks, chimera and other assorted baddies (most of whom are able to talk) they hope to gain enough glory to be become legendary "stars" in the world of Grandual. While it may not be the most complex fantasy world ever created, it was still a delight to inhabit!
Characterization: 5/5 
The characters are a riot! The five members of the titular "band" all have different skills and personalities, and their interactions with each other are what drive the story forward. But it's their banter and chemistry that really make them jump off the page. Their relationships and interactions are a major part of what makes the novel so enjoyable, and their journey together is one that will stay with me for a long time to come. Even the "bad guy" was so well realised that I found myself rooting for him at points.Individual Stand outs? Definitely Clay Cooper, whose sense of duty and loyalty to his friends make him a compelling protagonist. His dry wit and understated humor (especially as a complement to the frontman, Gabriel) are the drum-beat to this story. And then of course there is Moog the onsie wearing, outrageous and flamboyant, innocent-like-a-child, and optimistic-even-when-his-spells-go-very-awry wizard. Easily the character that made me laugh out loud the most!Ahhh Moog! Such a fan!
Plot: 4/5
The plot is fast-paced and action-packed, with plenty of twists and turns to keep readers engaged. While not amazingly original in terms of overall narrative arc - there was enough there (especially when combined with the pacing, humour, world building and characters) there to keep me "just one more chapter"-ing along, which is always a good sign. I also liked how the plot managed to balance the subversion of a number of classic fantasy tropes while also cleverly nodding to many others.
Enjoyment: 5/5 
I think it should be noted that the humour probably makes or breaks this book. It is so ubiquitous (even in rather deep or action filled moments) that if you don't gel with it, or prefer a more serious story then I would probably avoid this book. With that out of the way. You should know. This book is hilarious!! I can count on hand the authors that have the ability to make me laugh out loud while reading (Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, and Trevor Noah) and Nicholas Eames is now one of them! Whether through witty banter between band members, stupidly clever music/band references, puns or some of Moog's common outrageousness, the laughter just made this book phenomenal! I really liked how the novel never took itself too seriously, and the humour provided a nice counterpoint to the intense action and danger that the characters may be facing.As an aside, one of the reasons I'll re-read this book is to see if I can spot any other humourous "easter-eggs" that I didn't uncover on my first pass - there are literally hundreds!Alongside the laughter though were a number of heart-wrenching moments as old friends (who have been through thick and thin together) have to make some really difficult choices. Also, many of the characters in the book are grappling with their past mistakes and failures - indeed, for many, the reason they decided to join up to one final tour is at least in part to make things right. This layered with the themes of friendship and camaraderie made for some truly heartwarming and gut-punching moments. Tears? No. Welling? Yes.
Prose: 5/5
The writing style of the book is engaging, witty and fast-paced. To me it felt like reading a blend of Terry Pratchett (although without the satirical social commentary, and with more of an emphasis on clever wordplay and situational comedy), Scott Lynch (with similar blends of humour and action, but maybe this is a little more lighthearted than the world of the Gentleman Bastards) and with a dash of Joe Abercrombie (certainly not as dark/gritty, complex or realistic as Abercrombie, but fast paced and action filled like many of his novels). All of those author's are massive green ticks in my eyes - and so it should come as no surprise that I found the writing style here to be highly entertaining and engaging.
Final Thoughts
In short, Kings of the Wyld is a book that deserves to be shouted from the rooftops (or, perhaps, from the top of a wyvern). It's a raucous, rollicking, and utterly charming read that will leave you wanting more. So gather your adventuring party and set forth on this epic journey â€“ you won't regret it!The three books I'd recommend if you like this book (or if you like these three books I'd recommend this book) would be:- The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch- The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie- Guards! Guards! by Terry Pratchett Final Rating: 4.7/5  ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•Final Rating: 4.05/5 ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ‘
