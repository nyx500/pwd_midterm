Re-read 2016Ha! I love it when a series I read years ago actually HOLDS UP!Mostly, because that means I was right the first time, but also because it means...I WAS RIGHT.Yeah. I'm that shallow.Point is, book 4 was a fantastic conclusion to the Seven Realms series, and you should definitely give these books a try. Especially if you've been on the fence about this one.GET OFF THE FENCE! Original review: 2012Reading the last book in a series you love is always hard. I was so afraid this was going to be a disappointment (Mockingjay, I'm talking to you), but I couldn't be happier with the way Chima wrapped things up.5 big fat stars!The only thing I can't understand is why none of my GR friends have read any of these books.???
What is wrong with you people?!
The Crimson Crown is a wonderful ending to the Seven Realms books, but if the author wants to...*hint, hint*there's still plenty of room to write a few more books in this world.I, for one, would love to continue reading about all of the characters Chima has created.Dancer, Micah, Melody, Cat, Willo..Really, there are so many stories left to tell in the Seven Realms, that I refuse to believe this is the end!If you haven't picked up these books yet, you don't know what you're missing. The Demon King.Read it.Now!
