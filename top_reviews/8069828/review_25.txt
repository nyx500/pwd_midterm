MY HEART...OMG...it's all full of the warm and fuzzies but also the why did so many people HAVE TO DIE to get here?!? And that SHIP...THAT SHIP! I don't even know what to do with myself right now. I'll have to re-read something because there's no way anything else will compare to all the feels I have for these books, not so soon after finishing the series. Except maybe her new book, which I just so happen to have in my hands...but I don't want to taint what I felt for the Seven Realms characters in the Fells before I move on to another realm.

This is seriously going on my all-time favorite series list. And I know what I'm asking for for Christmas...the box-set, duh. :P
