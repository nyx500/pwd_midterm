Beautiful, detailed book with really interesting short stories in it. (Well, if 150 pages per average can be considered as short stories... but it's Brandon, so no one expected them to actually be as such.) If anything else, this book for me, with 
The Emperor's Soul
 and 
Mistborn Secret
 stories, is a clear reminder why that 
Elantris
 sequel is long overdue and why we need that world expanded. But, again, I adore Elantris, so I'm biased. I would trade every other of his work for Elantris 2 - Judgement Day. (I have no idea why sudden Terminator reference, I was born like that, shut up.)One more story I adore and world I find fascinating with amazingly interesting characters in it is 
Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell.
 You know how I complained and complained and complained (yes it was needed to be said three times, hexes people, hexes!) about Brandon writing almost all of his main female characters by the same 
Vin - Shallan - Jasnah
 pattern? Well, I still stand by what I said, but I did asked for one world where main female character isn't defined by her magical powers. And I totally forgot that he created such character called 
Silence Montane,
 a middle-aged innkeeper/bounty hunter. Alas, life is too short, so probably I will never get to read full novel about this 
Threnody Shardworld.
 (more like, when he finally writes it, I'll be in my fifties, and who knows if I'm gonna be as interested in fantasy as I am now, in my blossoming youth, hmm?)It was nice to be reminded how much I miss 
Kelsier.
 I did have such feeling, so it was nice to learn that 
Hoid
 is nothing more than a prick.And it was nice to meet 
Kriss and Nazrilof.
 To learn more about 
Shards, Adonalsium
 and usual 
Cosmere
 things.I did planned to reread 
Mistborn
 series immediately after this anthology... but after binge-reading 

Elantris

 and 

Warbreaker

 as well, I need to rest from Sanderson before I tackle 
Stormlight Archives
 for the fourth time.
