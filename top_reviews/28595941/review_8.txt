"...“All things exist in three Realms, Gaotona. Physical, Cognitive, Spiritual. The Physical is what we feel, what is before us. The Cognitive is how an object is viewed and how it views itself. The Spiritual Realm contains an object’s soul—its essence—as well as the ways it is connected to the things and people around it.” ..."
This is a collection of stories from the Cosmere Universe, the creation of Brandon Sanderson, which together or in parts has swept the Fantasy Genre Fandom and has created a following not unlike that of many of the old Fantasy Classics. I have read many of the works in this collection, but having them gathered together like this is a treat for the reader. For those who are not familiar with this author or the worlds he writes about, the Cosmere Universe consists of many worlds, all of them somewhat touched by magic and all the magic systems are different in some way, depending on the predominant sphere of influence that exists on the planet. All the many Magic systems seem to be written with one leading principle Sanderson employees :
“Magic works best for me when it aligns with scientific principles.”
 I believe all of them are marvelous and intimidating all in same measures. *** 5 ***The first story is "The Emperor's Soul " from the World of Elantris and is about a master craftsmen forger, Shai, who can meticulously copy and re-create any item by rewriting its history with skillful magic, knowledge and will. The concept is that an object can be "persuaded" do believe ti is different to the point that it changes itself and could even become something completely different. However, that something has to be believable to begin with, only then would the forgery stick and persist. I loved the idea that the world depends on how we perceive it and what our vision and belief can do to the reality we live in, choosing to make it better or worse. 
"...“People", Shai said, rising to fetch another seal, "by nature attempt to exercise power over what is around them. We build walls to shelter us from the wind, roofs to stop the rain. We tame the elements, bend nature to our wills. It make us feel as if we're in control. Except in doing so, we merely replace one influence with another. Instead of the wind affecting us, it is a wall. A man-made wall. The fingers of man's influence are all about, touching everything. Man-made rugs, man-made food. Every single thing in the city that we touch, see, feel, experience comes as the result of some person's influence.” ..."
This story packed a whole lot of emotion and thought in a very short space. A delight to the more cognitive-oriented reader. On to the next one ( will update this as I go... )*** 3 ***The second story, a very, very short 25 page one, is also from the World of Elantris and is called "The Hope of Elantris". It has some spoilers for the Elantris main book, but it is almost impossible to read and understand outside of the book's context. The main character is Matisse, who is charged with taking care of the children in the City of New Elantris while they are under siege. Nothing much new, just a slice of someone's life at that time. Not essential to the overall arc. Just a question for Ashe: 
""Where were you during those last hours before Elantris was restored?" Raoden asked. "I don't remember anything of you for most of the night."
*** 4 *** "The Eleventh Metal" is the third short story in the collection. It could be considered as a prequel short to the Mistborn original trilogy and is all about Kelsier and the moment he decided what to dedicate the rest of his life to. Although it is very short and might not be impactful outside of the Series, once you are familiar with the Mistborn books, this little short is a very telling and somewhat emotional moment of Kesier's life and what makes him the guy we all learn to like and trust. 
"... “Glass broke and metal tools clattered to the ground.“Have you any idea what all of that is worth?” Shezler growled, lowering his arm and advancing.“Your soul, apparently,” Kelsier whispered.” ..."
Definitly a recommended read for all those who have read or plan on reading Mistborn!*** 4 *** The forth short story was written for a RPG game. “Allomancer Jak and the Pits of Eltania, Episodes 28 through 30” (Mistborn)" is completely over the top and I had a smile on my face throughout the whole time reading it! Loved it and although it is just a fun short having to do with the later Mistborn books, I would recommend it not for its content, but for the obvious fun B. Sanderson had writing it for us. Enjoyed every second of it! *** 4.75 *** The fifth work in this book is  “Mistborn: Secret History” and we are once again in a pivotal moment for the Mistborn Original Trilogy... I would not recommend to read it if you have not read the first three books already, or if you have not, but plan on reading them... It would spoil the series for you, so don't do it!
"... “Oh, hell,” Kelsier said. “There’s actually a God?”“Yes.”Kelsier decked him.It was a good, clean punch, thrown from the shoulder while he brought his other arm up to block a counter strike.” ..."
 This was a very poignant and very telling story of the spirit of the original Mistborn Trilogy. It is told from the POV of Kelsier and I would not want to say anything about it, except that it is very much Kelsier and his stubborn refusal to do what is expected of him... Loved visiting with this beloved character once again and was very intrigued and happy by the postscript to this story, promising us more:):):) *** 4 *** The next story is “White Sand” (excerpt; Taldain) and it is a very new to me world, but apparently one of the first shorts Brandon Sanderson had written. Since it is very, very short and gives us just a glimpse of a world full of sand on its "Day" or sunny side, I have to say it piqued my interest quite a bit, leaving me wanting to have this character in something more major to read. I would love to read about this young and willful man who is trying to prove to his father and to himself that even with not much power, as long as you can think and use what you have optimally, you can be as successful as those with a ton of power but no ability to use it to its potential. 
"... “Grains of sand will only flow with the winds, Kenton, never against them.” ..."
*** 4.75 *** Wow! This was very unexpected!!! The seventh story in the collection is “Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell” on the shard world of Threnody, where vast Forests contain shades and monsters, inciting the natives of the world to liken them to Hell... In this place you have to be tough, and if you chose to live close to the Forests you had to be even tougher. Madam Silence is one of the toughest, being a proprietress of an Inn on the border with the land of the Shades. She is a widow and together with her daughter and a small orphan girl whom she fosters, they feed the weary travelers who stop in the place for the night. They also use their unique situation to note rode bandits and lawless men who stop by, and eventually find a way to turn them in for bounty, leaving no evidence of who the bounty hunters actually are. 
"... “She swept her knife through the first shade, as Grandmother had taught. Never creep back and cower before shades. You’re Forescout blood. You claim the Forests. You are their creature as much as any other. As am I. . . .” ..."
This story had a very spooky feel to it and send shivers through me for all kinds of reasons. No wonder many are afraid of the Forests - generation after generation creates legends and stories to created the image of monsters in their debts, and this is Brandon Sanderson's addition to those created in our time...
"... “What would it take?” she asked. “For you to see a miracle instead of a coincidence?”“It would take a miracle, obviously," Silence said, picking up her knife. "Instead of just a coincidence.” ..."
*** 3.44 *** The eight story, "“Sixth of Dusk” (First of the Sun), reads like many a sci-fi stories I have read growing up. We are on a World far behind in technology than ours and an Island not unlike those in Polynesia. A boy named Dusk is a trapper, but in a sense a caregiver and guardian to the very specific Avion creatures who can mentally communicate with humans and are the primary source of finances for the people living on the islands. A big company decides to take over the birds by mapping out their habitat with a machine left over from a visiting Peoples of another planet, who are many times more advanced than the locals. Following the rules of the Universe, an advanced society is not allowed to trade with one just in the beginning of its progress. They are also not allowed to mess with their progress. This story is a ethical question as to what is better for a just developing, but very curious culture, should it follow its own path of development, or should it be pushed on its way, and what is the ultimate price the budding culture would end up paying in the end. 
"...“The world is progressing. One man cannot slow it, no matter how determined he is."He stopped in the path. You cannot stop the tides from changing, Dusk. No matter how determined you are. His mother’s words.”..."
Interesting, but just too short and although it makes an impact, it leaves you wanting more... *** 4.75 *** And now for the crown jewel of this collection, the never before published Stormlight Archive novella, “Edgedancer”. It takes place right after the second book in the series, "Words of Radiance". lift, our "Awesome" thief is the main protagonist here and this is one of the reasons I was not looking forward to reading it. Not because of anything else, but I was not a fan of Lift's character. Although I know she is young and the author is giving her plenty of place to grow, and I mean miles and miles of space to grow, her selfishness and almost destructive tendencies are just too much for me... Yes she is funny and whimsical and kind of adorable at times, she is a pain in the ass and if I had to live with her, I would have killed her before she got to this level of pain-in-the-assery!!! What really, really makes me dislike this character, and with this word I imply a lack of respect on my part, is her complete lack of inquisitiveness and care about anything that goes on apart from her and her stomach. How can a young person be so totally self-involved and content that nothing around them can make them feel the excitement of wanting to find out more about it, or just to experience some awe of things around her, anything but her own awesomeness??? No thought for tomorrow, no thought for yesterday... At this level of her development, Lift is everything I find abhorrent about those who feel happy in their ignorance. Then why am I giving this story such high rating? Because it is a very important part of the overall arc of the Stormlight Archives. We get to see more and more individuals converting Stormlight and their existence itself tells us about what our guys are going to be in for and how much we will need all of them on our side. The other reason is the transformation Darkness undergoes and its importance in the story as we go on. Same for Szeth, who is trying to find himself after the chance he has been given for a do over. But most of all, I am in love with Lift's Spren, Wyndle. The poor plant elemental from the Cognitive Realm is just a scholar, a very inexperienced in humans lives scholar, who is forced to work with this 12 year old kid, who wants no responsibilities and cares not for consequences... The way they interact is wonderfully humorous, but also very touching and Wyndle has his hands full with this wild thing, who holds his life in her hands. It is hillarious as well, that Lift thinks he is one of the Voidbringers, who are the bad guys and opposite of the Spren, which he really is. Her offering him a soul to eat, when this is all what the Spren stand against, is hilarious!!! I love him sooooo much!!!
"...“All right. Maybe I can get you one soul. Perhaps a tax collector...'cept they ain't human. Would they work? Or would you need, like, three of them to make up one normal person's soul? -Lift” ...
So, if you plan on reading the third book in this series, "Oathbringer"m you have to read this before it! It is a must read!!!In conclusion, this whole collection was totally worth it and I would recommend it to ANY and EVERYONE!!!! Now I wish you Happy Reading and many more wonderful books to come!!!
