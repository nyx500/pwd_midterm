My first thought after reading Brandon Sanderson’s Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection was that it was lots of fun!! I had initially been a little leery about how this collection was repackaging some older stories, but as soon as I began rereading The Emperor’s Soul, I was hooked. What I enjoyed most was the new sense of connection to all of Sanderson’s worlds that the stories and commentary provided. If you haven��t previously read Sanderson’s work, though, I wouldn’t start here. I enjoyed hearing more about Kelsier and the Mistborn milieu, but, even though one of the tales is a prequel, I’d still begin my Mistborn adventures with The Final Empire. Finally, Edgedancer was great! I’m looking forward to more of Lift and Wyndle in The Stormlight Archive!
