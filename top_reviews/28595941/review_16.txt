With ‘Edgedancer’ finished, I’ve finally completed  ‘Arcanum Unbounded’! This is a collection of nine novellas/short-stories based in various systems within the Cosmere. Individually they vary in quality, though none of them are horrible, but as a Collection they’re almost essential if you had planned to read the Cosmere in its entirety.Having all nine works in this one collection, as opposed to owning them all individually, has a number of advantages. One, it’s much cheaper. Two, ‘Arcanum Unbounded’ is split into sections reflecting the System of the Cosmere that the books belong to. At the start of each of these sections is a really interesting short (page or two) essay on that System. It makes the Cosmere feel much bigger than if you had only read the main novels. There is also a postscript, written by Brandon, for each of the works explaining a bit about why he wrote it or what he was trying to achieve by doing so.Below are links to my reviews for each of the works in this collection. The only one I didn’t review was ‘White Sand’ as it is only an excerpt of a graphic novel, and a small one at that.
