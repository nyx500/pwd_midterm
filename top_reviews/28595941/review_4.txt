Well that was pretty emotional.It has taken me forever (almost exactly 1 year) to finish up my reading of Arcanum Unbounded! But hey, that's what happens when you want to read everything in order.Instead of a huge review I thought I would say a little piece about each story & provide an individual rating for each!
The Emperor's Soul
 - ★★★★★See my full review of this one here, as I read it last year!
The Hope of Elantris
 - ★★★This is a cute short story featuring a behind the scenes moment during the climax of Elantris. I didn't mind the story, but I absolutely loved Sanderson's inspiration behind it. The Postscript was definitely what made this one stand out for me.
The Eleventh Metal
 - ★★★½This story gives us a bit of background into Kelsier's initial training in Allomancy. Again, not a bad story for what it is but it's more of a foundational piece than a stand alone piece. I adore any glimpses of Kelsier that Sanderson will grace me with, though, so I'm not complaining!
Allomancer Jak and the Pits of Elantria, Episodes Twenty-Eight Through Thirty
 - ★As you may be able to tell by this ridiculous title, this tale is completely unnecesary. It doesn't add anything to my experience of Mistborn Era 2, and the only thing that made it readable was the humor present in the many (many, many, etc.) footnotes. But it turns out I actually hate reading footnotes because it strains my eyes and breaks my concentration a ton. So yea, I could've done without this story.
Mistborn: Secret History
 - ★★★★★WOW. THE TEARS. SO MANY TEARS. Ya'll I cried my little heart out reading this. THIS is how you do a novella in conjunction with a completed series. This was a masterful & heartbreaking & glorious addition to Mistborn Era 1 all wrapped up beautifully in 168 pages. This is a story that I needed to read, and is definitely one of the most emotional experiences I've had with a book in a long, long time.
White Sand
 - ★★★So my favorite part of this story was the magic system, which revolved around a person's innate ability to manipulate energy within sand. Once again, a little shorter than I like even my short stories to be, so I struggled connecting to it.This was printed as an excerpt from a graphic novelization & followed by a written version of the same tale. I have to say, while the graphic novel was neat to see, I enjoyed the story more in written form. I would love to see more come out of this System for sure! 
Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell
 - ★★★★This was one of my favorite stories from this collection! I found the characters & the world super intriguing, especially since we see an alternative type of metal use in this System than what we are used to seeing on Scadrial! Badass females, a terrifying planet, & some incredibly gruesome ways to die. I really loved it!
Sixth of the Dusk
 - ★★★ ½This is an odd story. I definitely enjoyed it, and I'm hoping very much that another future story will add to this one. The mechanics of the magic on this planet are fascinating but the story ended in a way that didn't satisfy me.I honestly think this story would've been served better in a full-length book rather than a novella, but overall a worthwhile read!
Edgedancer
 - ★★So... *looks away* I really didn't enjoy this story which is a real shame, I know. I just? Lift is literally one of the most annoying characters in this series & while I understand this may be for purpose of giving her space to grow it doesn't change how unenjoyable she is in this moment of her development. The snarky attitude & cutesy humor was just too much for me. Lift is 13, and so it makes sense that the tone of the narrative would reflect that. But I seemed to notice a bit of lack in the usual writing skill I've come to expect from Sanderson. Phrases & words repeated at awkward intervals & choppy dialogue. Really, the only thing good about this novella for me was a return to Roshar & a bit of expansion on the background happenings of the main series.Overall, this is a solid bind up of Cosmere stories that any fan of the series will absolutely want to get their hands on! Buddy read with some of my Sanderson-loving besties: Celeste, Sarah, Petrik, Haïfa, and Tweebie!
