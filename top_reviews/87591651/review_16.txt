The Stand is my favorite book of all time.This was my third time through it and my opinion hasn't changed one bit. I am in awe of this creation.Full review to come...stay tuned!!!Let's be real though, if that ever actually happens, it's just going to be me swooning for roughly nineteen paragraphs. Don't hold your breath.
