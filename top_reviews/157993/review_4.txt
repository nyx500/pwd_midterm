The Little Prince is a short story of a man who crash lands his plane in a remote part of the desert. The man meets a little fellow, The Little Prince, who regales him with his tales of his travels around the universe.This was a short book that carried a big punch. Although it is often labeled as a children’s story, it is so full of beautiful symbolism. The Little Prince is worth reading once a year.My favorite tale from The Little Prince’s travel is the story of the businessman. The businessman is busy counting the stars, claiming to own them because he first discovered them. The Little Prince asks him what he does with the stars, and the businessman says nothing. “I own a flower myself,” he (The Little Prince) continued, “which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I rake out every week. I even rake out the extinct one. You never know. So it’s of some use to my volcanoes, and it’s useful to my flower, that I own them. But you’re not useful to the stars.” There was another quote that I just loved: “I need to put up with two or three caterpillars if I want to get to know the butterflies.”This book is part of the 100 Books To Read According to the BBC:https://www.listchallenges.com/bbcs-t...2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones’s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta
