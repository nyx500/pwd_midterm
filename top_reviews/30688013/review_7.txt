‘ Are you ready, my brother?’Thank you Robin Hobb.I can't lie. There have been tears. What a wonderful gift this series has been and what a wonderful final episode.All strands were connected and interwoven in such an amazing way. Did Robin know how she wanted the story to end up all those years ago when she wrote the Assassin's Apprentice? It boggles my mind. I also found it slightly strange as well as delightful to see the worlds of the Elderlings and Kelsingra combine with Fitz's. Have you ever seen Bedknobs and Broomsticks? Well it was a bit like that when the real cinematic world combined with the animation!I noted so many memorable scenes while reading that I thought to cite in this review, but I'm not going to spoil your fun. I have (almost) never minded the long and winding way in which Robin tells her stories. Every word, you realise afterwards, had its place and its reason. But in this book I found the story zoomed right along from page 1. No more hints and subtle foreshadowing: all that's been done already in the previous books. THIS is the big reveal, where everything comes together.The ending was fitting and perfect.Please don't read this unless you've read the preceding volumes of this work. I'm sure Robin wouldn't thank me for saying this with so much of her writing career still to come, but to me this is her Magnum Opus.Thanks to Netgalley, Robin Hobb and Random House Publishing group for this ARC. All opinions are my own.
