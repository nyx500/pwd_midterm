“Don’t do what you can’t undo, until you’ve considered what you can’t do once you’ve done it.”
Five sub-series, sixteen main volumes, THE BEST fantasy series ever written and now it’s done.No story read so far affected me as much as this one did. I loved every word of it. I loved how this last volume connects all the loose ends from all fifteen which precede it. If you only read Fitz' story from Farseer, Tawny Man and The Fitz and the Fool and skipped Liveship Traders and Rain Wild Chronicles, you will not get the full picture of the events in this one. It intertwines both narratives in an epic ending so majestically weaved that I’m in awe. Should I say how much I cried over it? A lot. No book ever made me cry this much. Ever. But I so rejoiced in it that it was all worth it. And I can’t say anything else about it; I’m at a loss for words.Mrs. Robin Hobb, Chapeau! You are The Queen of words.LE: Robin Hobb on saying goodbye (or not) to Fitz & Co: http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertain...----------Finally here !!! I barely started it but I'm loving it already :)
