There are many things I like about Enchanted Forest Chronicles and obviously the characters are the main reason, but having read this series 4 times now I still really love the magic system of the forest. It's nothing new really, it's just so cool to me - the way King does his spells. When I read this book for the first time I thought that all of those threads and knots of magic were the coolest thing ever. Still do. “I'm sorry. I'm used to people objecting to things because they think I can't do them or shouldn't do them. It didn't occur to me that you might have a real reason.” Cimorene is still one of my all time favorite female characters. In my eyes she is the original "not like other girls" girl, or in this case - princess. But in her case she is actually different without being pretentious or weird about it. And as far as male characters go, Mendabar is awesome - he's grouchy, he's intelligent, he's a gentleman and he's easy going. He's also impishly awkward. How's that for a King?My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG
