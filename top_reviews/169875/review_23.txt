The second book in The Enchanted Forest Chroniclesis, in my opinion, a worthy follow up to the first. While it focuses on Mendanbar, the King of the Enchanted Forest, rather than Cimorene the plot is still extremely engaging and as humorous as the first. Indeed, Morwen and Kazul are both present as well, and plenty of time is taken up expanding the Enchanted Forest and adding to its unlikely - and charming - lore.King Mendanbar discovers that the Enchanted Forest is losing some of its land, as well as the magic therein. When nothing but burnt ground and discarded dragon scales offer up an explanation, he's resigned to bring such evidence to Kazul, the new King of the Dragons. Only Kazul is missing. What follows is an adventure with Mendanbar and Cimorene, complete with bumbling giants, a faulty magic carpet, and conniving wizards. Can they rescue Kazul in time and unravel the mystery?I praised the previous book for just how positive a role model Cimorene is, and that carries through strongly in this book. Mendanbar is proof enough that men tend to like more independent women, and even as they both dismiss most princes and princesses as silly they acknowledge there isn't really anything wrong with the fact. You'd be silly, too, if you lacked the proper opportunities to grow yourself. The book is full of clever characters, humor, cats, and delicious cider. It's a quick read and one I plan on getting for some of the younger girls in my life once they're old enough to love it as I did.
