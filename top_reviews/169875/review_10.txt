Searching for Dragons introduces a new character, Mendenbar, who is the king of the Enchanted Forest. Mendenbar stumbles across burnt spots in his forest and a bunch of dragon scales in the area. On the way to figuring out the story behind everything, he meets Morwen and Cimorene. This installment had Cimorene taking a back seat so we didn't get to see much of her witty and clever side which was a shame. Mendenbar was definitely the 'main' character in this one. I didn't find him all that likeable but he had a lot to discover about his kingdom and magic and he expanded the plot outside Kazul's cave, which I guess is a plus. The book continues to break stereotypes (who said a magic carpet ride had to be glamorous?) and quite a few buckets of soapy lemon water make appearances in this fun sequel to Dealing with Dragons.
