4.5 stars rounded up to 5 stars!I stayed up way too late finishing this book. Iâ€™m going to suffer at work tomorrow! ðŸ¥´ðŸ¤£This is always the sign of a good book when you canâ€™t put it down and finish it in days.Magic Bleeds did this to me. This is the 4th book in the Kate Daniels series and I knew that I would enjoy it. Iâ€™ve enjoyed all the books in the series so far!What I did not realize was how much I missed this series and characters. Ilona Andrews has created a kick ass heroine that most everyone can cheer for. Sheâ€™s tough, competent, loyal and snarky. In my opinion, the best kind!Magic Bleeds starts off with Kate investigating a fight and murder that happens at a neutral spot between the shapeshifters and necromancers.A shapeshifter was killed in a gruesome way and ends up involving the Biohazard unit with the Order of the Knights.Why was this shapeshifter killed and does it involve Kateâ€™s father or are the necromancers doing this?Magic Bleeds continues with the hidden history of Kate Daniels and her heritage. Iâ€™m really enjoying where the series is going on this plot. We not only get more information about Roland, but we get to see where Kate and Curranâ€™s relationship is taken.Yeah, that was entertaining and steamy!The only gripe that I had with Magic Bleeds was the lack of communication that happened with Kate and Curran in the beginning.Ughâ€¦must there always be drama with not talking to someone?!Another great subplot in the book was reading and experiencing all the shapeshifter politics with the alphas and different beast clans.It gives the series and shapeshifter community more interest and plots for further books!One last thing that's great in Magic Bleeds, thereâ€™s an attack poodle in it!If you are looking for a great urban fantasy series to read, check out Kate Daniels. You wonâ€™t regret it!
