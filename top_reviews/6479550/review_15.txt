"You know you've read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend."â€” Paul SweeneyNow I have no idea who Paul Sweeney is. I could hazard a guess that his occupation is a barber and he swings toward the demonic side of life, but I have a feeling that this would be inaccurate. Please forgive me. I'm an illiterate, poorly educated plebeian - I admit it.I also ask the many Kate Daniels fans on my friends list to forgive me. I made you think, in my first review, that I wasn't really digging this series.I was wrong. So very, very wrong.I loved this series. I loved it so much. I know there's more to go but I wish it were out already. I can't wait to read more and when it finally does end for good, I will be devestated.Everybody was right, Curran mellowed a little bit but he never changed. I suppose, over time I just grew to accept him. He'll never top the list as my absolute favourite literary boy toy. I think Clayton may just always sit there with Barrons and a few others scattered around him, semi-naked and cooling their hot bodies on the beach sands as I walk among them...OKAY! Back on track! But I have a total girlcrush on Kate. I love and adore her! I love this world that Andrews has created and the writing with which she has crafted it.-Signed,The New Kate Daniels Fan Girl
