Reread August 2021 : 4 stars. I liked it better this time around, so I'm bumping up my rating. I understand why I stopped after this one a few years ago, though. It's such a good place to stop??? Anyway if it wasn't for allll the great reviews of the later books, I would pretend that everything's fine and stop here again but alas, I'm more invested this time so I'll read the rest. I HOPE I DON'T REGRET THIS ðŸ˜¤.
