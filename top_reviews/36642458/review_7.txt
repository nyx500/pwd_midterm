Iâ€™m fluctuating between a 4 and 5 stars, so 4.5 ðŸŒŸ for now but damn! I felt robbed by that ending. The scope of this world, the characters and plot is about to get even bigger AND THE EXCITEMENT I FEEL! I donâ€™t understand how he does it. Sanderson canâ€™t do no wrong. THIS is how you write a YA sci-fi/fantasy book. With depth and substance, whilst still knowing your target audience. Yes, the above comment is very much a dig at the mediocre YA fantasies that have been getting published. Iâ€™m still floating in space - so no â€˜reviewâ€™ from me just yet - but I can arrogantly say that if you didnâ€™t connect to this book, youâ€™re the problem. Itâ€™s you. (Note the sarcasm PLEase. Donâ€™t come for me in the comments. But really, you should question yourself if you didnâ€™t like this book. Just some unsolicited advice from a reader who means well.)
