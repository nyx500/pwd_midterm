Skyward is the freshest and most exciting science-fiction novel I have read in a very long time.
There is a great deal to talk about here because there is a great deal Brandon Sanderson does right. Well, he does everything right really. I do not have a single criticism. The plot is fantastic. The world building is totally excellent. And, as ever, Sanderson gives little away at the start. He slowly builds the layers through the plot and reveals how extensive this world is towards the end. The small little universe the characters have been occupying is part of a much greater expanse. So, this felt like a beginning to a much larger story that has epic potential. Another reviewer called it a prelude, and I am inclined to agree. Sanderson is clever with his storytelling; he always has been. He likes to create illusions for his readers. He likes to make you imagine a world from a certain perspective and then reveal the truth of the situation as time goes on. His stories will never follow the linear path he makes you believe they are going down. And, for me, that’s his greatest strength as a writer. 
“People need stories, child. They bring us hope, and that hope is real. If that's the case, what does it matter whether people in them actually lived?”
I love this quote. And this story is full of little gems like this one. Central to it all is a remarkably strong young woman who drove the story forward with her unmatched desire to become a pilot, protect her home and see the stars. She is funny and she is weirdly cool. She grew up on stories of epic adventure and has imagined herself the heroine of her own quest, a quest to prove that her father was not a coward and a traitor. She does not want to be branded with such a false legacy. And, as I said before, the story would never quite go in the direction is appeared to be going in. The reveals behind her legacy are feats of storytelling prowess. The seemingly ordinary (yet still engaging) novel about fighter pilots develops into an imaginative and mystical exploration of the human soul and its connection with space and the stars. Although technically young adult, Sanderson captures the stark beauty of human ingenuity here and its will to overcome the most insane odds through nothing but perseverance. There are many adult themes here and some of them quite dark too. 
“You get to choose who you are. Legacy, memories of the past, can serve us well. But we cannot let them define us. When heritage becomes a box instead of an inspiration, it has gone too far.”
It would be remiss of here not to mention the star-ship, M-bot, the ship with a soul and an obsession with mushrooms. And this idea reminded me of the ships from Robin Hobb’s Liveship Traders series, the idea that a vessel can bond with its owner and together they can achieve extraordinary feats through magic and a telepathic connection. Sanderson only touches on this here as the story comes to a close, though no doubt this will be explored further in the sequels.  Thank you, Brandon Sanderson, for your persistently excellent storytelling. I can genuinely say that it has been over a year since I enjoyed reading a book this much. 
Skyward is remarkable in every way, it is so special, and it is easily my favourite Sanderson novel I have read so far.
