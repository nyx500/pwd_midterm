Spensa could crash her starfighter into me and I would thank her. Sanderson is a characterization expert. He has clearly spent a lot of time thinking about his characters. Not just what they look like or what their main personality traits are, but how they would react to every situation and how their past influenced how they grew up. He understands Spensa so well and it's evident in the little things. Spensa is a realistic, sympathetic character and I love her. Her behavior makes sense with the context of her past and what she has had to do to survive. She's brash and defensive and not trusting, but that was how she had to be growing up. She relishes freedom but is resigned to the fact that she'll never have it for long. Spensa, despite how hated she is, has a contagious spirit, passion, and dedication that I adore. I love how Spensa isn't so stubborn that she doesn't know when to give up. She knows her own weaknesses and she knows when a situation is hopeless. This book is what YA fiction should be. The side characters aren't made of cardboard. They're memorable and wholesome. Skyward treats death like... death, which a lot of YA books don't. Death is permanent, it's not something every character can resurrect from. Loss is real here and feels real. The plot of this book isn't too complex, but it's the execution that makes it so good. It's addictive. I was never bored. It flew by so quickly. The action scenes were incredible and made me scream. Skyward exceeded all my expectations. There are a lot of questions left unanswered, so I need the sequel right now. 5 stars
