"Just for that, I shall hunt your firstborn and laugh with glee as I tell them of your death in terrible detail, with many unpleasant adjectives!”You know how sometimes you realize you’ve read 500 pages and it was all fluff, nothing really stands out and you can't even remember most of it? Well this book was the opposite.So much happens, the characters are flawed but their growth is fascinating to watch. The story is complex and becomes more interesting as it progresses. Every time I thought I knew where things were going… I was wrong. And happy to be.The teenage angst, an hilarious sentient ship, the lack of romance… This is how you create a fantastic YA book! Sanderson is not afraid to make you laugh... and cry.Absolutely recommend this book.Also shoutout to Doomslug!
