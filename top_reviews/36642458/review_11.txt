Skyward(Skyward,#1) by Brandon SandersonSkyward was brilliantly written. And it had a compelling, captivating, and engaging storyline. Loved those unique characters. It was a fine read and it wasn’t a bad one by any means, but compared to the other books I’ve read from Brandon Sanderson, it’s by far my least favorite.
And the warrior’s way was not to run from failure, but to own up to it and do better.
Not bad.
