“Because there is only one Queen of Ithicana. Just as there is only one King. And if any of our enemies dare come for our kingdom, we will bring them to their knees.”
What a emotional, jaw dropping, action packed, intense and beautiful conclusion to Aren and Lara’s story!!There were so many instances in this book when I wasn’t sure things were going to go right. Plans kept getting screwed up, emotions and anger at an all time high, action, battle and survival scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat! I couldn’t put this down and I truly considering grabbing popcorn at one point!I’m a sucker for romance. If you read my reviews then you know there’s nothing that I love more than a beautiful romance. Aren and Lara’s love for each other was so undeniable, even though he tried hard to convince himself and every one else otherwise. The way they protected each other during their journey, saved each other’s lives on more than one occasion and wouldn’t stop fighting for their home and each other was just perfect! *chefs kiss*I also enjoyed being reunited with characters I’d grown to love from book one, especially Jor. One of the best parts about this book? MEETING LARA’S SISTERS! You know how sisters normally fight, bicker and argue to no end? Usually they can’t stand each other but will protect each other against anyone? That sums up Lara and her sisters perfectly! And I can’t forget to mention their assassin level fighting skills! Very bad ass! The ending was intense but perfect in my opinion. I think we got a wonderful ending for Aren and Lara.Now about book 3! I don’t know whether I truly trust Keris but I was very intrigued by him, and I’m seriously interested in finding out what happened between him and Zarrah. Considering these two are completely opposites, (that obviously attract) I’m excited to read their story in the next book!!5/5 ✰’s
