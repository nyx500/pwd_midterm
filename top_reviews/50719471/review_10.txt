I feel like I've waited for The Traitor Queen for years instead of months. Also, I currently feel half-dead and can't quite believe that Lara and Aren's story is over. I adore Danielle L. Jensen as a person (she's awesome) and after months wondering if she was going to break my heart, I finally have the answer to that question: yes. She broke it a few times over the course of 66 chapters and every time it was totally worth it.The Traitor Queen was action-packed, and Danielle L. Jensen played with my sanity, she scared me to death countless times, and simply made me feel way too much. It's pretty simple actually: it was perfect. And I'm going to miss the hell out of Aren and Lara. These two stole my (shattered) heart and I couldn't have loved them more - even if I tried. But my love for The Traitor Queen isn't reduced to Lara and Aren (and how, may I repeat, Danielle scared the crap out of me). She imagined a world that I completely fell in love with and secondary characters that I want to see again asap. There's a lot of potential for future stories in said world, with said characters and I can only hope that I won't die of impatience. But until then, let me tell you how I adored Lara's sisters. They were even more badass than I expected them to be. And Sahrina? I won't say much because I don't want to spoil anyone (who might read this) but she's my queen.And Keris... damn that man is hot and smart and I need more of him. So much more. Same for Zarrah because she was such an interesting character!Taryn isn't dead! yay!!I could go on and on for a long time but just know that this was absolutely amazing and I'm already feeling nostalgic. I'm a thankful mess. Before reading/You know what? F*ck it, I'm going to build that time machine myself.
