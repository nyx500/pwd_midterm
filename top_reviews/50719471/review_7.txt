Sadly didn’t enjoy this book as much as the first installment in the series. It still was an easy and fun read, but the plot was not that intriguing and really slow. The main characters felt a little bit too stiff, I understood their motivations, but that didn’t really help me enjoy the story more. Still thrilled to read the next book in the series!
