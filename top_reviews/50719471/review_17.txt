AS IF HE DIDNT MARRY HER TO MAKE PEACE OF COURSE SHES GOING TO LIE ABOUT SOMETHING. LIKE COME ON???- HE. DIDNT. GROVEL. BUT SHE DID???? ILY BUT BABE 🧍‍♀️🔪-Lara my love my queen I love you stay badass <3- plot was all over the place - BUT I STILL LOVE THEM YOUR HONOR IDK WHAT IT IS - HURT/COMFORT SERVED HERE 🧎‍♀️- ZAARAHKERRIS!!!going to act like this book didn’t exist because it almost ruined book 1 for me 🌝 but still excited for book 3 :) even though I have a feeling it will disappoint
