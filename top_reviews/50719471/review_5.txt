"Lara, no matter where you are in the world, if you need me, I‚Äôll come for you. Please know that.‚Äù  *screams into a pillow* Wow that was intense. I had high expectations and the book delivered. The Traitor Queen is an action packed book. The world building stays elite, and it's so brilliantly written. The characters are well developed and I couldn't keep this book down (well once I found my rhythm). There were some parts in the book that dragged on a bit longer than required, in my opinion but the story never loses its touch.Aren and Lara had me screaming and crying. I was for real sweating throughout the ending. The tension is real. Those two are such an iconic couple, it's hard not to root for them. I liked Keris and Zarrah a lot, so am excited to see what the two have to offer in the next book. I'M SO EXCITED FOR IT!! If only I could go back in time to a couple of days ago so I could read this series for the first time again üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
