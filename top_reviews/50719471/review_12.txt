I dont usually put spoilers, but I have thoughts on this book. 🧐First, so much damn heartbreak 💔 Like, an insane amount. I felt like Lara needed a Therapist a few chapters into the book. The onslaught of emotions she went trough by her father, sisters, Ithicana--was a lot. Sure, she deserved it, but it was so damn much. 😵I enjoyed the reunion with her sisters, I hope they return throughout the series. Which leads me to another thing. At the end of the book, the author mentions that for book 3 were getting a new story from Zarrahs/Keris POV. What? 😌 excuse me! This is exciting!!!🧡I'm kinda sad that the story wont continue with Lara and Aren. Yes, I know they will definitely appear in the other stories, but they wont be the highlight...but I'm excited for the other pov's. I loved how Lara and Aren went from enemies to lovers, to enemies and back to lovers. The ending was great, but I dont know how much that shark myth will last for Lara. It's hard to believe that the loved ones of those that died could easily accept her as their Queen again. 🤔Overall, I loved this! I read this book insanely fast. The action scenes, the forbidden love, the cutthroat way of Kings and Queens was captivating. I just wish we were getting 5 books from Lara and Arens perspective. But, I can see how if we truly want to immerse ourselves in this world we need multiple pov from other kingdoms. I will recover from my distress.. hopefully. 😅Also, for my romance lovers there is one love scene. The slow burn is real 😂 Danielle Jensen you are too cruel.(4) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
