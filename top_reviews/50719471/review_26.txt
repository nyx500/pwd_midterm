I read books 1 and 2 back-to-back, and my review for The Bridge Kingdom absolutely applies here as well. So instead of repeating myself, here are two things I loved about the series: CAST One of the strengths of Danielle’s writing is her ability to make side characters feel wonderfully defined. This large, fully-formed cast of characters significantly elevates the reading experience. ECONOMY AND TRADEThis was the first fantasy novel I’ve read which had a huge focus on trade between nations and the impacts it has on the country's economies. I’ll admit I never expected to find this in the fantasy romance genre. Not that there was any silliness in the novel that needed making up for, however, if there was, the exploration of trade is the perfect antithesis.
