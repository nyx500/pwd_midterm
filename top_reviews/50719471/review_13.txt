SO MUCH ACTION AND ANGST! I really loved this book and how the plot was non-stop action. There was never a slow moment and I had no idea how Lara and Aren were going to fall back in love or how they were going to save Aren's people. So good! I loved how we saw more of Lara's sisters and how Aren had to fight his love for Lara with his hate for how she betrayed him in book one. I loved it and can't wait to read another book in this world about a different couple in book three!!
