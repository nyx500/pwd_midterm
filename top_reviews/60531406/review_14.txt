Actual Rating:  4.5/5This was delightful! I love adult fairy tale fantasy books and books with a narrator, this has both so I knew I was in for a fun time from Chapter 1 and that's exactly what this is. Tress's adventure and the friends she makes along the way is such a whimsical cozy time, even while having to problem solve her way out of VERY dangerous situations. I know the inspiration is more Princess Bride but it reminded me so much of Stardust, which is a huge compliment cause I am always looking for things that make me feel as happy as Stardust does. I think a few things that prevented this from being a new favorite of all time (although it is still absolutely amazing for my tastes) is that because of the narrative voice I was not quite as close to Tress as I wanted to be. But that's a small complaint. Everything was so vibrant, the tone was on point and I loved the pacing and pay off. Maybe on re-read one day it will become and all time favorite, it is incredibly close.
