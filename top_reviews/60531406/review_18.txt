What a whimsical, wonderful novel! This was such a surprise as the tone was a departure from Brandon’s usual style but I absolutely loved the almost fairy-tale nature of the story. Tress was a lovely protagonist and following her on her journey was just wonderful. The narration fromHoid was so welcome and gave many hints to other hidden secrets. I can’t wait to read the rest of the secret projects and this was just such a fun experience!
