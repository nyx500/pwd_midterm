DNF @ 35%Don’t give me that look, I’m as shocked as you! I was always told that if I had nothing Positive to say, then I’d best say nothing at all… But I hate being told what to do so let’s get Negative!Ha! Jks (kind of), I’m not looking to rain on anyone’s parade and I’m willing to shoulder a percentage of the blame for this DNF (only my 3rd ever, I believe) as I had no right picking this up. Modern Fantasy hasn’t been “trending” on my tbr for over a year now but, nevertheless, I couldn’t resist buying into Sando’s Secret Projects and when I saw this in my email, I fell into my friend Nataliya’s reading philosophy and thought, “Ooh, shiny!”.Plot: Teenage Girl loves boy—boy gets kidnapped by Sorceress—girl decides to cross treacherous ocean composed of deadly spores in order to save boy—alarmingly negligent parents not only approve but assist in girl’s efforts to stow away on a ship full of men of unknown repute in order to achieve said goal… You know how it is.I said I’d shoulder a percentage, but not all of the blame for this DNF. It really boils down to one reason I just COULD NOT continue with this. Well, two but they really fall into the same category: dialogue and inner monologue. They are written so incredibly poorly I could hardly believe what I was reading. Through the narrator’s (Hoid’s) voice, Sanderson has gone with a kind of “jovial-look-how-(wit)ty-I-am-let’s-make-an-observational-joke-about-absolutely-everything” tone and it’s so SO CRINGE! I was rolling my eyes so much while reading this that it turned into a sort of motor tic and started affecting my personal life!”Why are they always fair maidens?” she said. “Are there maidens that are unfair? Perhaps they mean ‘fare’, as in food. I could be that kind of maiden. I’m good with food.”

Sando thought this one was so clever, he used it twice in the space of 7 pages:"It might be said [Charlie] had a way with words. In that his words often got away.""It might be said that Tress had a way with words. In that her words tended to get in her way."

It just goes ON and ON, my friend:”It wasn’t quite like water; it was too thick, and the tips of the waves broke apart into puffs of green spores. In fact, the sea was wrong in the way that solely something almost right can be. Familiar, yet alien. As if it were liquid’s disrespectful cousin who told inappropriate jokes at Grandma’s funeral”.W..what are you even talking about?! Put your hand up if you think that makes ANY sense!

In the introduction, Sando says they hired a “sensitivity reader” for the project. I’m walking away from reading this with a perpetual eye roll and a newfound propensity for telling shit jokes! Who’s looking out for my comedic sensitivities?! ‘Team Dragonsteel’ had 53 employees as of 2022 (likely more now), I don’t think it would blow the budget to hire one more for comedic quality control.Shit, I didn’t say anything positive did I?... Umm, there's probably an epic Sandalanche?! 😅
