3.5 starsThis book is unexpectedly really funny at times! Unfortunately it also seems a bit more YA-ish than I would like, though Sanderson bills this as a grown-up fairy tale in the postscript. On the other hand, this is a book narrated by Hoid which I absolutely enjoyed. The world building is pretty unique and interesting, while still fitting into the greater Cosmere. So all in all, rounding this up to 4 stars and looking forward to the next “secret project” from Sanderson’s Kickstarter.
