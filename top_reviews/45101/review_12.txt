This is definitely one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. It's the 2nd/5th book in the series, so it is hard to talk very much about this in much detail but suffice it to say, there is not a single plot line or character arc I was not interested in in this book, which is quite a feat given that we have about 5 threads going with ~20 main characters. Thematically, this is a powerhouse, and I cannot wait to find out how this trilogy endsCW: slavery, SA
