This was one of those easy 5-star reads where I was gripped from the first to the last page. It's a chunker but one I was glad to spend so much time with, since it never stopped delivering utterly intriguing character developments, lore drops, or epic plot moments. I've enjoyed all 4 Hobb books I'd read previously, but this is the first one that really had me entranced with maximum immersive engagement and emotional investment the same way my favorite books have. For a Hobb book it moves at a torrentially fast pace with major events continually happening in the different plotlines and locations, yet it still delivers her trademark deep character and theme work wrapped in her understatedly elegant prose. It definitely hit some kind of reading sweet spot for me where all the narrative aspects just worked so beautifully together in terms of plot, setting, character, and theme. The things that happened in Mad Ship particularly related to memories are the kind of epic fantasy elements that make this genre so special.I'm so eager to continue but also so worried about what might befall all these characters both human and non-human I've come to care so much for.
