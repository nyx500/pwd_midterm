“Open your eyes. This horrible mess is your life. There is no sense in waiting for it to get better. Stop putting it off and live it.”Unlike the previous installment in the Liveship Traders series, Robin Hobb's The Mad Ship immediately gripped me. It is engaging and I was more intrigued by the story of the serpents and how it connected with the fate of the traders. This gave the story even more complexity. With Hobb, I'm never surprised about the depth of the world-building. One thing I did realize is that Hobb doesn't have throwaway characters. Seemingly minor characters have a way of popping up later and taking on important roles. Also, characters evolve in compelling and believable ways. Looking forward to the next installment! “Everyone thinks that courage is about facing death without flinching. But almost anyone can do that. Almost anyone can hold their breath and not scream for as long as it takes to die. True courage is about facing life without flinching. I don't mean the times when the right path is hard, but glorious at the end. I'm talking about enduring the boredom, the messiness, and the inconvenience of doing what is right.”
