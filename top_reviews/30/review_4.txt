⤐ Overall.Admittedly, this was not one of my favourite reads, not by a long shot. If it weren't for the giddy excitement of finally discovering the literary roots of one of my favourite film-trilogies, I wouldn't have ever made it through these. The writing style was magnificent, but the story-telling so lengthy at times I didn't know where to put my brainpower.I was also very unsatisfied that John chose to stell the stories of the individual character(groups) in sets and not according to the timeline, alternating between the different POVs. It made me very impatient, and not in a good way.
The Two Towers
 was definitely my favourite in the series, it was the most exciting one and also allowed for much needed get-to-know-the-characters-time. You cannot help but really love the bromance between Gimli and Legolas (and Aragorn, to an extent). The introduction of the one and only Shadowfax was another highlight for me, the main reason I was attracted to the films as a kid. The horses in general are a particular beautiful part of the films, except that tons of them died during the making of the movies of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.
