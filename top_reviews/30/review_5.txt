Update December 2020:Iâ€˜ve been eyeing this edition for a while and was circling it for the last few days. When I checked this morning, the delivery date shown was before Christmas. So this is now officially my Christmas present to myself.*+*+*I love Lord of the Rings. I doubt I can add anything of value to the discussion, that hasn't already been written about LOTR. I had a one-volume-edition once, like Tolkien intended it. It looked a bit daunting at first. I had meant to read the book for 20 years or so, but never dared to tackle it. Then the first movie came out. I decided to watch it and then read the book as far as the movie went. Then wait for the second movie, read the second part of the book, wait for the third movie... You get the idea. That plan went down the drain, when Gandalf fell into that chasm! As soon as I came home, I grabbed the book and flicked pages to find out, if he was really dead... I then tried to stick to the plan, but just had to keep reading. It still took me a month to get through it, but I enjoyed it very much. I have never re-read it, because I am a little scared that I wouldn't love it as much anymore. And no, the first 100 pages did not bore me at all, and I mean that.
