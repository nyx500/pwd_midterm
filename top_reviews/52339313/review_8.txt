 Misgendering, allusions to deadnaming, depictions of gender dysphoria, exploration of parental death, non-violent references to blood magic, some descriptions of ritualistic blood-letting☑ Watch my spoiler-free #ownvoices reading vlog for Cemetery Boys!☑ Check out this interview I did with Aiden Thomas!☑ Read my second CB review for even more detailed feelings!I am THRIVING. I am LIVING. I am convinced this book was written for me and me alone and I will be accepting no other feedback at this time. While this story acknowledges the realities of queer pain and queer trauma, it is resolutely written from a place of JOY and love. It's fun as hell to read, the trans Latinx rep is out of this world, the gender-affirming magic system is so well executed, and ultimately it's an empowering story about honoring your truth.Don't you dare sleep on this goddamn blessing of a book, because it's going to be a mirror that so many of us have needed for so long.
