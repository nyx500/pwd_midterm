4 stars*PS: I delayed posting this review because I wasn’t quite sure about the rating.  ❛ A dragon without its rider is a tragedy. A rider without their dragon is dead.. ❜  Forth Wing is an addicting read. One that completely transports you while reading with the world building and its details, that immerses and engrosses you so deeply in the plot-line with the obnubilating querelles and the politics and fables orbiting around them, that hooks you so seductively with the characters’ complexity and the dragons’ veracity of feelings and nuances. Finally, one that wrecks you by the inevitable deaths and unforgivable lies.
"I’m his revenge against my mother." 
 Violet Sorrengail dedicated her 20 years of existence to satisfy one and only fonction studying to be a scribe. She lived, ate and breathed books, maps and legends but after two colossal tragedies that tarnished her family’s happiness her mother —general Sorrengail, a high and emblematic figure of the Navarrian politics and army— decided to submit her "daughter" —violet— to embrace her siblings’ carrier path and passion, riders; dragons riders. She had to integrate Basgiath War College and follow only one sadistic rule; staying alive for the three years of formation but how could she accomplish it when the mere thought of her —frail and fragile—existence irritated approximately the three quarters of the college and most importantly Xaden Riorson —a wingleader and subsidiarily one of "The Kids Of The Traitors." whom parents where barbarically executed under the orders of Violent’s mother— who vowed to make her his worst enemy and him her worst nightmare.
"I won’t let him end me without drawing his blood first, that’s for damn sure."
Violet, my dear Violence what a woman you are. Her character gained exponentially strength and power throughout the storyline. It was interesting and enticing to witness how she had to accommodate a role and a fonction she wasn’t meant to fulfill in the first place. How she managed to model, in some occasions, her scribe’s acknowledges and spirit into a rider’s profile, how she recycled her "weakness" into a strength. Violet was mostly a lovable and relatable character. Quite honestly, her tight bond with the dragons, her sister and section’s friends added more than just some subtle colors to her personage; in a way her day-to-day basis and how she interacted with her closed cercle painted and highlighted her character brightfully than her "rider’s trainings" or her flashbacks as a "soon to be scribe". The storyline lacked to translate "the anterior Violet" and most importantly her bond with her late father. Let’s hope it’s more detailed in the sequel. 
"And when others are quick to stand in front of me, Xaden always stands at my side, trusting me to hold my own."
Xaden’s character was your typical tortured, dark hero. Tall, brun with endless scars that caricature dramatically his traumatic past. However, he wasn’t that easy and simple to dissect, at the end. Without diving too deep in the explication, his intentions and what side he politicly believed in and was alleged to were relatively easy to deduce from what the plot line was delivering as indices, here and there, but the motives that shadowed them were without contest a surprise and the actual puzzle to solve. but I LOVE LOVE LOVE HIM.
"Does it even matter when, as long as it changed between us?""Because I only want you, Xaden.""There’s nowhere in existence you could go that I wouldn’t find you, Violence."
The romance held a soupçon of ennemis to lovers or.. ennemis to friends ? Still, the course of events that led to have both Violence and Xaden’s faith sealed together was brilliantly orchestrated. However, the romance was fast paced but enjoyable and beautiful nonetheless with the way Xaden always had Violet’s back and never questioned her acts and intentions. But their chemistry.. oh god their chemistry, it was so vibrant and intoxicating through the pages.The dragons carried the book. How they had their own personalities and felt so real through the pages is still so mesmerizing. The supporting characters occupied an important part and role in the storyline. They were there for Violet whenever she needed them. Especially, Liam, so far he was the most attachant character. my favorite~•~•~•~•~Can we now talk about how the Death Owner is called Malek? ~~~~peer, peer pressure *sigh* buddy read with my bestie lila😗~~~~Rebecca Yarros ? with Fantasy genre? yeah, deadly combo.. im smelling the not happy ending, tho
