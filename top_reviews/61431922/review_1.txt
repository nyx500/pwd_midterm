I’m sorry, but it’s a no from me. It’s always a case of you questioning yourself when a hyped book doesn’t work for you. But I have reasons and regrets and I want a refund. Of my time and money.I can’t decide whether to rate this 2 or 1 ⭐️.It’s a 1 ⭐️ rating. 🤦🏾‍♀️I’m about to drop some truth bombs, 
so if this is the type of book for you in where you don’t want to hear any form of slander, then look away.
I’m going to be honest about my reading experience, which wasn’t all that great.😓It seems that fantasy romances, whether they’re adult or YA, have been using the same formula these past few years in where the focus solely lies on the plot and the action scenes and the same attention isn’t given to the characters and their world. And I do not understand why that is the case. The balance between them all is off. The characters (all of them, not a single one was interesting) lacked substance, background and history. So by nature, I’m not even remotely interested in rooting for them and seeing them overcome the challenges they’re facing, because they are so poorly developed to begin with. The foundation of this world felt unbelievably flimsy and read messy to me. It was supposed to feel dangerous, the stakes were supposed to be high. Characters were being killed left, right and centre and the only thing I felt was nothing. There was no order to the way it was being built upon. Just chaos, convenience and stupidity all round.Violet’s character could’ve been made more interesting (to me) if:▪️We had we seen her time as a scribe before she was forced to become a rider.▪️See her actually train and get stronger.▪️See how she generally fought through her chronic pain. ▪️See her deal with the grief of her brother.▪️Explore the weird dynamic she has with her mother.▪️See the friendships forming and the romance truly developing. ▪️See her fuckin’ bonding with those dragons. All of these things would’ve added nuance and depth to her characterisation, to the actual story itself. Are we privy to any of that? No. Those aspects are mentioned and that’s supposed to be good enough whereas I would’ve liked layers. Characters shouldn’t read so one-dimensional.And enemies-to-lovers where? Please. 🙄 This trope was used in the most juvenile way. You could argue that the romance itself was juvenile.We could’ve honed in on the hate since both these characters suffered losses, come from different and opposing backgrounds, have some real animosity and tension built between them but the love interest was hardly ever present. Next thing you know, the trope was flung out the window instead of it being morphed into something real. So, I fail to understand why this was sold as a fantasy romance. I can’t tell you why these two liked each other, let alone love. There was no development of genuine, romantic feelings. There was a buildup of attraction and supposed sexual tension. But that’s it.Another thing that bugged me is that we only got Violet’s perspective. I mean, this occasionally works, but ideally, no fantasy book should have a singular POV. I can’t begin to tell you how boring that narrative is. It gives such a limiting and subjective view of the world and the characters, and this especially gets more limiting when there are other characters present that also play a significant role in the story.Yet they weren’t utilised.Is it that hard to give different perspectives? The dragons were the ONLY interesting parts about this whole book. But they didn’t even get as much page time as they should’ve. They deserved more page time. I mean, if you’re going to have them talking, give them a POV as least. They could’ve told us about their own history.There were also some language choices that were made that felt odd in a fantasy setting. 
“Personally, I’m not arguing with their logic, just enjoying the view…respectfully, of course…”

“So. Freaking. Beautiful.”

“Holy. Fuckin. Hot.”
No one talks like that in a fantasy world. 😒You know damn well some of this lingo doesn’t belong here. It’s so embarrassing and a testament to bad writing and bad editing. To top it all off, I still don’t know whether this was adult, new adult or YA fantasy. I couldn’t tell you. Goodreads has them all listed. Clearly, everyone is confused. In conclusion, all of this to say that this brand of poorly written, poorly developed fantasy story is just not for me. This book was not for me. I had a really difficult time immersing myself into the story. The ending was somewhat interesting, but by that point I was skim-reading. And I don’t care about this book enough to continue on with the series. I want to forget I ever read it. I’m avoiding all hyped books for the foreseeable future. 😪💔
