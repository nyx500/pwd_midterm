4 ‘Violent’ ‘Skilful’ and ‘Delicious’ stars for a book with fascinating characters, exhilarating and heart pounding action and an equally immersive story.My body begins to tremble, a fluttering starts in the pit of my stomach, a throbbing pain erupts in my body. I take a seat. I breathe. I brace myself for the unknown. I am ready. “I need to bind myself before anyone notices”, because I am not about to step on the parapet like the cadets, I am just sitting down to read the second instalment of the ‘Fourth Wing’, but there is a noticeable adrenaline rush!!!. 😂😂With height trials, physical battles, a contest of wits, a deadly war, and a kingdom under threat we have the perfect setting for a fabulous fantasy, or should I say ‘romantasy’. Yet in the elite world of Basgiath when every day could be your last and every battle more challenging and brutal than the last, there is still room for a spicy but slow burn romance. Only a few will survive in this fiercely competitive world, but the FMC more intelligent in her years, knows that even though her physical prowess does not equal her mental ability and determination she brings alive the sentiment that “Coming in last is better than coming in dead.”Fierce, breath-taking, cunning, competitive and totally immersive.The PlotAs the youngest daughter of the general commander, Violet Sorrengail, is both a contender and a target, not least because she is the daughter of much disliked ruler but because only the fittest and most determined are likely to be bonded with the revered dragons.It is Conscription Day when the book opens, and Violet’s older sister is coaching her much shorter and more fragile sister on the rules of battle. Only days before Violet learns that is not to be sent to the Scribe Quadrant which she had been preparing for, for years but the Riders one which is tantamount to a death sentence. With daggers packed in her new armoury, Violet is sent off to the college with a few words of advice, ‘stay away from Xaden Riorson’ who will kill her should her identity become known to him.Of course, the sizzling chemistry starts, the smouldering looks turn to lust and the relationship develops between them. The ultimate enemies to lover’s trope written into an excellent plot with all the scheming, betrayals and deception that make this such a superb book.Review and CommentsWho doesn’t love a thrilling and addictive story where the underdog is to fight for survival and her place at the elite Riders Quadrant. Like we have them every day!!!The story was so well written but a few niggles for me which lost a star overall. The book was a bit slow two thirds of the way in. It lost its energy and the pages, like the romance, were a slow burn. I also both loved and disliked parts of the ending. The twist was superb but overwritten a little and a bit too contrived.That aside, I loved the rest of this book and would not hesitate recommending it to anyone. This setting of being tested by your superiors, hunted by your peers, and being forced to let your instincts and determination guide you appeals to me especially when the triumphant succeed as dragon riders and we are set up nicely for the sequel.The characters, even the more cunning and dangerous ones were so well developed in this novel. I adored Violet and Xedan, was irritated by Dain, and loved Mira and Rhi. Deliciously evil, sometimes brutal, tantalisingly seductive, obsessive, tenacious, and thrilling. In a fascinating fantasy world – Fourth Wing earns a very credible 4.5 stars.
