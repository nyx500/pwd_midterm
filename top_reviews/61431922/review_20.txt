[EDIT: bumping up to 5 stars because I literally havenâ€™t stopped taking about it]This book is taking the world by storm at the moment, and I can see why. While I love the concept of dragons, I often don't find myself overly loving stories about them - until now. This is a story that took me awhile to get into, but once invested I found myself entirely enthralled. The high stakes of the dragon rider training had me flipping the pages endlessly, and the kinda-love-triangle, kinda-enemies-to-lovers relationship dynamics had me by a chokehold. Just as a note too, I didn't realise how much it would mean to me to see a main character with chronic pain/leg issues still smashing it - and also without it being a big deal. In this book we see Violet actively work with her limitations, adapt situations to fit, and engage in those conversations about supposed "weakness" and how adapting a situation isn't cheating. Violet also points out at one point how she has strength of endurance with her chronic pain, that she's used to continuing despite it where others may come to a halt at an injury. This is a thought I've had myself, and seeing it written in a fantasy book felt jarring and comforting in one. It meant a lot to me, and I can see it having the same affect on others too. I really expected to be underwhelmed by this given all the hype, but I'm just here to add my voice to it now.
