— 3 stars ☆Y'ALL LIED TO ME. this was not zodiac academy except even slightly better, not in the least. 🥱first of all. this was so very formulaic. and by formulaic, i mean YES i wanted more character development, YES i wanted more world-building, YES i wanted more actual depth to literally everything. but overall i did like it? i just didn't love it, i wasn't awed by it at all. there was zero background to Xaden and Violet's so called "relationship" (and i don't even get how it started, okay?? even torydarius [zodiac academy] had more development to them than what this was). the fact that Violet instantly became jealous of some random girl bc she was "friends" with Xaden, and at that point they didn't even know each other even remotely. 😩😵‍💫
I'm in love with Xaden.
oh rlly? already?? what makes you think that - after fucking one time and talking for what, maybe 10 times max? and being "together" for a week or something? i could not believe in the timeline of their relationship AT ALL. what about the fact that i still don't get why they "hated" each other? i saw the tension between them, yes. i saw the attraction. WHERE ARE THE FEELINGS?and ngl, the action and actual plot scenes made me wanna skim so much 🥱 following them took me immense amounts of energy that i did not possess (strange how it seemed i did have that energy to read unsphere the stars [a tom/hermione fanfic, don't ask] and the husky and his white cat shizun [which btw is so addicting] 💀). i thought i'd be so hooked with this and in the middle part, i was. but then it just started dragging so much for some reason. also the way i was rolling my eyes when the phrase "silver lines i instantly recognize as scars" came up 😵‍💫 that was literally so cliche and the way i always fall for it but not here lmao 😭 Xaden was hot af already but there's no need to put in scars to enhance the empathy/pity/sympathy we feel for him k bye -the portions i actually enjoyed though, were -— TAIRN AND ANDARNA. my beloveds. my dragons. idc, i'm keeping them for myself. they're the more precious adorable lil babies (also is it weird i acc wanted to fuck tairn for some time lol) 🫶💘 also literally all the dragons made the book icl this was boring af otherwise— the banter was top-notch fr. formulaic or not, Xaden was truly a man written by a woman and that's the highest compliment 🥰🥺 rebecca sure knew how to pick them huh jkshjhsadjfgfh HE WAS AMAZINGGG. the way he always knew what Violet needed, at all times? 🥺🥺— THE ENDING. made my jaw drop. ngl, i actually liked that Xaden betrayed Violet bc i knew it was gonna have to have happened one way or another lmao. but also the fact that Liam died was such a shock?? i did feel something for him 😭 also THE FACT THAT VIOLET'S BROTHER CAME BACK— all i'm looking forward to in the next book is to see Xaden beg for Violet's hand like the man he is 🥺 plsplspls let that happen so i'd say, this was definitely not life-changing or monumental in any way whatsoever. but, it was a fun romp nonetheless. while it has a unique enough premise, it's also cliche in the sense that there wasn't anything particularly NEW here. yes, the dragons managed to more than sufficiently capture my attention, buuuut... i expected more. and i'll probably still be picking up the sequel, just.. maybe after reading some more spoilery reviews and managing my expectations the next time lol.__________________________________i had sm fun reading with you, bestie!!
