For once, I'm glad for peer pressure. The How to Train Your Dragon meets Divergent vibes were simply impossible not to love. Add to them an incredibly well written romance and a stellar world-building, and you'll get why this book was so damn addictive. Fourth Wing is entertainment of the purest kind and I'm pretty sure Rebecca Yarros must have laced her words with something freaky, because I couldn't detach myself from this book once I started it. I'll be super honest and admit, at first it took me a little to get into it properly. I was interested, yes, but not hooked, and thought the whole book's vibe felt a little too YAish for an NA.And then, around 20%, BOOM! Somewhere in bookish heaven someone flipped a switch and I was a goner. The writing and world-building improved with the story, and I started enjoying everything about the plot and its consistency. Fourth Wing's universe is easily one of the most interesting settings I've ever visited with my imagination. 
"You're freakishly calm for someone who just heard she's about to be hunted.""It's a typical Wednesday for me."
The trials and challenges Violet and her dragon rider friends go through reminded me of the glorious Divergent era, where love triangles were a must and teenagers armed with braids and a rebel spirit overthrew governments left and right, and it filled me with nostalgic enthusiasm.I adore Violent as a main character. She was technically a bit of a Mary Sue if we had to nitpick terms and personalities, but you can't help but root for her, because she's brave, sweet and just effortlessly likeable. Xaden is a hottie.He made me swoon every time he had a line and, even if I knew what was going to happen with him, I went for it with no regrets. He's just so...afhaihfihashifaoijlmaklnskjakjsbjlc.Yeah, let's not tell Cassian. The romance is amazing. I know I'm not being original with my adjective choices, but I think sometimes simple is better and there's really no other word I'd use for the bundle of sexual tension and emotions that is the Violet/Xaden pairing. It kind of gave off the same vibes as Oraya/Riahn, but with a little less animosity and a couple more profanities. Their banter is fantastic and so quotable I must have highlighted the majority of their interactions. I ship it, sooooooooooooooooo bad. 
“Damn it. Touching you was a bad idea.”“The worst,” I agree, but my tongue skims my lower lip.He groans and my core melts at the sound. “Kissing you would be a cataclysmic mistake.”“Calamitous.” What would it take to hear that groan again?The inches between us feel like kindling, ready to burn at the first suggestion of heat, and I’m a living, breathing flame. This is everything I should run from, and yet denying the primal attraction I feel is completely, utterly impossible.“We’ll both regret it.” He shakes his head, but there’s more than hunger in his eyes as he stares at my lips.“Naturally,” I whisper. But knowing I’ll regret it doesn’t stop me from wanting it—wanting him. Regretting is a problem for future Violet.“Fuck it.”
I've learnt to fully appreciate secondary fictional characters in the last three years or so, and I really like what RY did with hers. Even if, I'll admit, I'm not a fan of some of her choices. You know what I'm talking about, Rebecca.As much as I loved Violet and Xaden and everything about them (seriously, the romance was just so...so good?!?!?), the thing I loved the most about this book were the dragons. Every interaction between the riders and the dragons, from the very first till the last, had my heart galloping like crazy.I felt like a kid who's just discovered fantasy exists, and I think, without a doubt, that it's all thanks to RY's fascinating portrayal of dragons.If I were a writer and I had to write about dragons, I'd want them to sound and look just like the ones in Fourth Wing, which loosely reminded me of Eragon and Draco from DragonHeart. The ending and all that comes with it was a little predictable, but I liked it nonetheless.Can't wait to see what's going to happen in the sequel. So, yeah. Fourth Wing is great for so many reasons, but mostly because it's objectively one heck of an interesting story that also happens to be squisitely written. It's totally worth the hype, if you ask me, and I'll recommend to all my fellow readers, because it's got something for everyone, but I especially recommend it to those who, like me, grew up with Hunger Games and Co. We made it, guys. Full circle and all <3I'm not giving it 5 full stars because imo the start was a bit slow and confusing, but I overall adored it.About the audioook: I started this as an audio and ended up getting the ebook because I couldn't stand the constant hard breathing and loud gulping of the narrator. She sounded like she had a stuffy nose and lacked emphasis, so all her characters and emotions sounded the same. I don't know if she was having trouble with her mic or if she was sick and on a deadline, but I didn't enjoy the audiobook at all. King of narrators Teddy Hamilton only narrates one single chapter at the end, so I can't exactly say he saved the day, but...he did make me regret getting the AB a little less.
