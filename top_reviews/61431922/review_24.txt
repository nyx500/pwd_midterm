rebecca, babes, if u dont release the next book immediately, i will haunt your dreams and nightmares.this book had no business being this phenomenal. i was enthralled from the very first moment. and the fact that it reminded me so much of divergent?? please bury me with it. if the movie adaptation (& there better be one) isn't like divergent I DON'T WANT IT! I wish, wish, & wish that this was dual pov and i wish the chapters were shorter bc there was absolutely no need for 30 pages in one chapter but i let it slide cus i enjoyed this.
‼️(spoilers so don't read because i strongly STRONGLY recommend u go into this blind. but u can skip to quotes)‼️
this bitch bonded 2 mf dragons and i expected NOTHING less. i just love her. i wanna be her. she had a giant ass dragon bending for her so she can get on his back, he willingly wanted to hold her instead of letting her fall (unlike the other dragons) because she couldn't keep her seat.anyway, the relationship between tairn and violet was the cutest thing ever. dkm but i'm attracted to a dragon. tairn specifically and only. don't come for me bc u dont have an imagination ✋🏼

"A dragon without its rider is a tragedy. A rider without their dragon is dead."

xaden my hubbs, i adore him. this man had daggers designed for her, specifically her. he designed a saddle for andarna so she can ride with them, and a saddle for violet so she wouldn't fall. he trained and protected her even when he didn't "like" her.

'And when others are quick to stand in front of me. Xaden always stands at my side, trusting me to hold my own.' 

i was so heartbroken when liam died, he deserved the happiest of endings. he's still alive in my heart but his death was so unnecessary, i'll never forgive u rebecca, u just had to make us cry.
"I go where you go." His hand tightens over mine.
anyway, i'm so glad this wasn't a love triangle and she immediately picked xaden after realizing dain was just not the one (he's adam kent in this book) he was so fucking annoying i was praying tairn would finally burn his stupid ass but, unfortunately, he's still alive 😆

 'Silver lines I instantly recognize as scars,''I reach out and trace the dragon relic on his back, my fingers lingering on the raised silver scars,'  this is tris touching four's back tattoos. i was so overwhelmed with the familiarity in this scene. ugh i love them all. "He takes hold of my hands and brings them to his chest. “So do whatever you need to get it out. You want to yell? Yell at me. You want to hit something? Hit me. I can take it.”"You walk into a room, and I can’t look away. I get anywhere near you, and this is what happens. Instantly hard. Fucking hell, I can barely think when you’re around."He yanks me close and kisses my forehead. "There is no me without you,""You're going to be the death of me." 'She can't die because I know I can't live without her even if I do.'"There's only you violence. Even when I'm not you, there's only you."
