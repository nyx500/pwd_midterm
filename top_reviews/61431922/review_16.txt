3.5 ðŸŒŸOK SO I GOT PLAYED A LITTLE!!!!THE GOODThis was a HIGHLY enjoyable book. I had so much uni work to do, but I still flew through it. The author wasted no time â€“ she made a fast-paced, action-packed, well established fantasy world. I love how we got introduced to bits and aspects of this world slowly, she really KNEW how to world build, how to ease us into this complicated setting. AT EVERY POINT OF THIS BOOK I knew what was going on, who I was rooting for, what are the aims of the particular scene. And you, my fellow fantasy readers, know how that doesnâ€™t always happen. Like I said in the updates, EVERY SINGLE PAGE WAS A PLOT POINT and no fill-ins. I hate it when writers drag the story, you can really tell when they do that, and fantasy authors are for some reason prone to doing that. This wasnâ€™t such a book. Itâ€™s not that long (around 400 pages) and I wasnâ€™t bored in any scene. I love how the story intensified towards the end, but the stakes were high throughout the WHOLE THING. THAT Xaden CHAPTER ATEATEATEATE, I LOVED IT SO MUCH!AND THAT PLOT TWIST IT ENDED ON, I COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING! UGH, I canâ€™t wait for the next book. THE BADI said it before, WILL SAY IT AGAIN, this is the most formulaic book Iâ€™ve read in my life. You know when popular musicians make songs SPECIFICALLY so they can become popular on TikTok and you SOMEHOW ALWAYS KNOW. Yes, this was that, but for books. You can really tell the author used EVERY SINGLE TROPE she knows people love and will eat up and put it in her book (enemies to lovers, mated pairs, the whole rebellion trope, Iâ€™m the chosen one but I donâ€™t want to be that blablabla), I just couldnâ€™t get past that fact. Before reading this book I saw a few posts saying how this book is similar to ACOTAR. When I just started it, I didnâ€™t really see the resemblance, but THEN I GOT IT. Dain is SOOOO Tamlin coded, Xaden is basically Rhysand, again the rebellion thing, THE MATES THING (god I hate that so much). I wouldnâ€™t call this a carbon copy of ACOTAR, but you canâ€™t tell me it wasnâ€™t loosely inspired by it (for the sole purpose of satisfying booktok).This was in no way original, and thatâ€™s the number one thing I didnâ€™t like about this book. There wasnâ€™t a single thing happening, a plot point, a scene, a character trait, that I havenâ€™t seen before. This plays into this being EXTREMELY FORMULAIC. For those who read it, is it just me? (I know it isnâ€™t)THE DRAGONS WERE SO FUNNY. Iâ€™m sorry, I didnâ€™t like the dragons. I liked them individually (as almost characters) BUT they WERE IN NO WAY WELL WRITTEN. Theyâ€™re supposed to be these mysterious, dangerous, sacred creatures, but Violetâ€™s dragon says the word FUCK at one point. I LAUGHED SO MUCH, HAD ME ON THE FLOOR. THE CHARACTERSUgh, theyâ€™re supposed to be adults, but theyâ€™re SO YA CODED. You canâ€™t tell me Violet is 20. Surprisingly, I liked the protagonists, but individually. Theyâ€™re both flawed, but also with a sense of moral, a great combination of characteristics. However, them as a couple, not really. The banter was there in the beginning but then it just evaporated. They went from being enemies to LOVERS THE PLANET HASNâ€™T SEEN so quickly. They were enemies for a good chunk of pages, I must admit that, but the change was in no way gradual (pls go to the Mariana Zapata slow burn school k thanks). (And also, Violet was so desperate with the L word, GIRLIE STAND UP!!!)The spice was good ngl (had me kicking my feet lol)I LOVED THE SIDE CHARACTERS. RHIANNON AND LIAM (sorrows sorrows prayers) HAVE MY HEART. FINAL THOUGHTSThis was a fast-paced, highly enjoyable first book in the series I will for sure continue reading when the next installment is out. It wasnâ€™t very memorable and wonâ€™t make the FAVORITES list, but I still had fun reading. Iâ€™m leaving room for improvement. Is it overhyped, tell me in the comments??? (letâ€™s have a respectful discussion)ðŸ’•ðŸ’•
