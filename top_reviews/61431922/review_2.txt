"A dragon without its rider is a tragedy. A rider without their dragon is dead."  THIS BOOK🤌🤌 Y'all believe me it's worth the money. I am in loveeeeee, easily the best book I read this year and one of the best romantasy I've read in a while. Books like this are the reason I fell in love with reading. Let's just jump right in, cause am excited to write this review.  Read if you like-  ✔️ Zodiac Academy✔️ Divergent✔️ Throne of Glass✔️ Dragons🐉✔️ Academia setting (war college)✔️ High fantasy✔️ Chronic illness rep✔️ Enemies to lovers ✔️ Slow burn ✔️ Spice (3.5/5) 🌶️ "... There's nowhere in existence you could go that I wouldn't find you, Violence."  Trained to be in the Scribe Quadrant, the  FMC- Violet,  found herself in the Riders Quadrant- the most elite of Navarre, where survival is of the fittest and the strongest. All she needs to do is not get killed and bond with a dragon, but it's not as easy. Not only she has to escape the clutches of the students who want her dead, with few dragons willing to bond; she also has to keep away from  Xaden, MMC  who wants her dead. From page 1 till page 633 I was hooked. The  world building  is detailed and well thought out. The  plot  is consistent and true to itself. The  pacing,  fluctuates a bit in the second half but mostly stays fast paced for the majority of the book.  "Tell me what you're thinking?""I was thinking you are exactly as I predicted the first time you took me in my room.""Oh yeah? And what was that?""A very dangerous addiction."  Coming to the  characters- ⚡Violet-  I loved her. She's brave, compassionate, goes to lengths to protect others and knows how to stand up for herself and others. Having had chronic illness, people always underestimate her  (all but one)  but that's what makes her an underdog. I liked how balanced her character and personality was, never over the top. Loved following her journey through the war school and boy how she developed and grew in those pages.  🖤Xaden-  Idk if anyone else is saying this but I will- Xaden has the same vibe that Warwick from Savage Lands does, but Xaden does it better. There's just something about their personality that's so similar. Give the Savage Lands series a go if you liked Xaden. Anyway, I loved him so much. He's a badass. Once her started opening up, and we got to see the softer side of him- I was swooning. He's powerful, sexy, and knows when to pick his battles, certainly not a push over.  Dain-  What an ass. Radiates the same energy as Tamlin in ACOMAF. The other  supporting characters  are good as well, they grow on ya- especially the dragons and Liam. Tairn and Adarana have my heart. I loved them since the first time they spoke. They have a sense of humour, are badass and protect so fiercely. Saegyl was okay-ish, not much of her tbh.  Now I want a dragon 😭   "I'm going to keep you. You're mine, Violet." "Only if you're mine."I've been yours for longer than you could ever imagine." ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥  The  romance is an angsty slow burn, enemies to lovers with spice  and oh how brilliantly it was executed 🥰 I was all in my feels, swooning and melting and basically loved it. And if you like the  characters being jealous,  you'll enjoy that trope here too. I do think there was a pinch of "who did this to you" but wasn't that impactful. Xaden and Violet's  chemistry  is off the charts. They compliment each other so well and I like how open and honest they are with each other, and that both of them don't hold each other back and give the other room to make mistakes, learn and grow. It is a mature relationship yeah. Also, the  smut  was hot.. no seriously, things did get hot and broken down 🤭The  ending  was an emotional rollercoaster. I was crying so much at one point, had to take deep breaths to resume reading. I cannot wait for the sequel 🤩It's such a masterpiece in my opinion. I haven't felt this in love and so strongly about a book in a while and am so genuinely happy I read this 😭😭❤️It's a binge worthy action packed romantasy with never a dull moment. You are missing out if you haven't read this. Idk what are you all doing, GO READ IT! I promise it won't disappoint.  Y'all think Amazon will have a dragon? 🤔 ~•~•~I have no words. I'm gonna take some time to collect my thoughts. But WOW. ~•~•~Y'all I know I just started reading this but am already in love. I predict 4-5 star rating, hopefully that will be the case.
