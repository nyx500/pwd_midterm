there's a valuable lesson to be learned here and it's that when you see the entire goodreads community read and five star the same book you run as fast as you can in the other directioni especially enjoyed the mediocre writing, boring love story, and the "this might as well happen" plot where an allegedly frail and weak character is at the same time overpowered as fuck and gets everything handed to her on a silver platter. 0 stars. chrysa, please don't abandon me, i can find a good book to buddy read, i am sure i still have it in me
