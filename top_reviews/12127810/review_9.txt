Oh, these books are going to destroy me! However, despite loving this, there is something different which makes it a bit hard to decide on the rating. I feel like there was something missing in this story, maybe too many characters, so something had to be cut... Because since there are so many of them, people tend to find favourites, and then they wish for more content about them. This book had me totally destroyed, I did not see this coming at all and it was so painfully good, I just cannot take it.I just wish there were more of Jason/Piper moments because so far they are quickly becoming my favourite couple. I adore Percy and Annabeth; they are the original Riordan couple; I could not wait for them to get together. And I'm so happy for them.I hope that Percy and Nico will talk and everything will be all right forever.I'm not a fan of Happily Ever After but I so much need a happy ending for Nico and a book for him as well.I finally started to like Leo , please, be with Calypso! However, I still don't like Hazel or Frank. They just do not fit with the rest, to be honest. Well, I hope that there will be different ending than that Jason'll go to the Half-blood Camp and Percy to the Jupiter Camp.Maybe this book wasn't perfect, but I'm not able to give only 4*. I would feel terrible. Because these books are just so awesome and leave me grasping for the next book.
