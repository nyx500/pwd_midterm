 * A Darker Shade Of Magic 🌟🌟🌟🌟 * A Gathering of Shadows 🌟🌟🌟 * A Conjuring of Light 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 This series has been on my TBR since before this book was even released and I kept procrastinating and the general rule in this situation is that I am always sleeping on a good book! I really enjoyed it that it deserved a 5 stars from me. This makes it the 4th book to get this rating out of 95 books I read this year and I will try to explain why.🌟 After my mild disappointment with the second book which I thought was slow and suffered from middle book syndrome, I lowered my expectations significantly before starting this one as it was the largest, and I could not imagine reading 666 pages of slow pacing as in book 2.🌟 What I love in Schwab’s writing is her small multiple chapters, this book almost had a 100 chapters (not kidding) and they were short which kept me attached to the story with the dreaded “just one more chapter”. This style became like Schwab’s specialty in writing as it could be found in most of her books.🌟 Now small chapters alone are not a recipe for a good book, but add Schwab’s good writing and that would it make a very good recipe! There is something she does where she writes a kind of parallelism that I really really love and I don’t think I can give an example without spoilers so I will leave it for you to discover it in the book. There was the right mix of banter, sarcasm and serious writing at the right doses. I found many quotes that I really liked and if I highlighted them my book would have ended up half highlighted! 
“What are we drinking to?” “The living,” said Rhy. “The dead,” said Alucard and Lila at the same time. “We’re being thorough,” added Rhy. 
🌟 The characters in this one developed immensely and then Schwab killed all of them! No, I am kidding but this was brutal and many characters do not make it so do not get attached to any of them! But I almost liked all of the characters whether they were primary or secondary ones!!(Me, whenever I think about the characters in this book:)🌟 Now the plot in this one was definitely better than the second book and it makes up for it because it felt like it was a bridge for all that happens in this one and a lot does happen specially at the beginning! There were a few questions that were left unanswered and a few things that felt like they were coincidences but in reality were very important for the story!🌟 Summary: I loved this one, from the writing to the characters to the pacing and plot! It was an addicting book from start to end and although there were a few details that irked me, I am trying to ignore them for the majority of the book which was excellent and I will be continuing Schwab’s books in the future for sure!
