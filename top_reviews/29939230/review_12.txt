“Myths do not happen all at once.”You would not be wrong in thinking of me as a girl of few certainties. “...They do not spring forth whole into the world.” The usual ones: the love of my family, my love for them, and one big dream -we all have one of those, even when we don't know we do- that keeps me going.“...They form slowly, rolled between the hands of time until their edges smooth...”There are also one or two things peculiar to me alone, of course. Unfortunately, they have a tendency to be dull things. But one of these, the brightest one, I think, is that I love stories. Always have, always will.“...until the saying of the story gives enough weight to the words—to the memories—to keep them rolling on their own.”And once, I used to think I knew how stories work. I thought I was able to pick them up, look them over, and tell who and what and where and when. (Though not the why; the why is always another story.) “...But all stories start somewhere...”I thought indeed that I could say, here it starts, and, there it ends. But as I grew, and read, I started to see that things are not quite this simple. It would take a certain story to finally make realize the truth. The truth being...“...and that night, as Rhy Maresh walked through the streets of London...”The truth being, stories don't like to have their boundaries set. Never have. “...a new myth was taking shape.”And never will.•One day I'll publish an essay on what makes for a good storytelling, and all I will write in it will be: Victoria Schwab nailed it all down. There is no other way to put it: in A Conjuring of Light, and in the Shades of Magic series more generally, she was perfect. Elegant, graceful, confident, composed while vibrant and stirring while unruffled, polished, dynamic, exquisite; in two words, absolutely regal. Schwab's prose is something you can't equal, because it's one of a kind, something you can't forget, because it won't let you go, and something you can't even believe, because it is, very simply, too beautiful and mesmerizing to be true.•Each one of these characters is so fleshed-out I'm honestly astonished that even their names can stay put and flat on the page. In the previous instalment, I'd had some issues with Lila, who in my eyes had gone through the whole book being more boastful and hot-headed than I -or anyone- could take, instead of showing the determination and strength that had captivated me in A Darker Shade of Magic. But the Lila we meet in this conclusion is definitely more mature, while losing none of her distinctive fierceness and boldness and tenacity. 
“There were a hundred shades between a truth and lie, and she knew them all.”

•Kell, Rhy and Alucard are just as amazing as we all knew they would be, plus, prepare yourselves to be delighted -and wrecked, and shattered, and wrecked some more- by some secrets concerning Alucard's (and to a degree Rhy's) past and some crucial plot-twists determining our favourite crown prince's future. The events test them both, and they are made all the stronger by their obstacles, the ones they share as well as the ones they have to overcome alone. Rhy's dedication and resolve, in particular, are splendidly inspirational.•It seems my stupid, stupid mind realized this only with this book, but Holland is such an incredible and extraordinary character. I cannot explain how much my heart bled and sang for him. I feel the need to reread the whole series just to appreciate him as he deserves and as I should have done from the beginning. 
“Caring was a thing with claws. It sank them in, and didn’t let go. Caring hurt more than a knife to the leg, more than a few broken ribs, more than anything that bled or broke and healed again. Caring didn’t break you clean. It was a bone that didn’t set, a cut that wouldn’t close.”
•Osaron is one of the best villain I've had the (dis)pleasure to meet in a long while, and I was completely caught off guard and captivated by how compelling he proved to be. Besides, I utterly adore the concept that he's pure magic. 
“It is an arrogant man that thinks himself a god. And an arrogant god, thought Tieren, looking to the window, that thinks himself a man.”
•The plots of A Darker Shade of Magic and A Gathering of Shadows were already exceptional, but A Conjuring of Light basically towers over them. Fast-paced and heart-stopping, yet it never comes off as overly packed or in any way excessive -since we've already established that Schwab's trademarks are elegance and balance, I shouldn't even need to specify it.•There is one single insignificant tiny thing that felt slightly random, or maybe out of place, and that's the favour that Lila traded with Maris. I expected it to be brought up again before the end, and it wasn't, and it felt a bit like a loose end. I'm really trying not to hope that Schwab purposely made it so, so as to have a sort of foothold for a possible continuation/spin-off/something, I promise I'm trying, but it just seems so natural and obvious once you notice. I just don't want my heart broken (again). Speaking of loose ends, I also thought Nasi's POV had been introduced because she would have a role later in the story, but that was apparently a red herring or purely a necessity in order to develop Ojka's character.•I think that plot-wise this works perfectly, and I feel that this was exactly how things were supposed to go, but I was and still am dreadfully curious about Kell's past. I guess that's just something I'll have to live with. (See how hard I'm trying not to hope?)➽ I could try to put into words what I feel for this series, I could put my thinking cap on and make countless attempts, and still I would get nowhere. There simply are no words. I can only redirect you to my review of A Darker Shade of Magic and my review of A Gathering of Shadows, and hope they'll make my point a little clearer. Because believe me, you want to pick this series up. Of course, afterwards you'll want to kill me for introducing you to the most addictive obsession (?) of your life. But I'm more than confident that you'll also want to thank me. And until then, anoshe.
