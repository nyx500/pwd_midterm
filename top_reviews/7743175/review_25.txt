What a journey it's been! With good, with bad, with joy and sorrow - the whole package, like in real life..Mentions about the whole series:
PROS
: •	Very complex world building: a whole world with many races/nationalities, all with their specific looks, way of dressing, customs, etc •	Compelling and always developing characters •	Beautiful storytelling, vivid descriptions, interesting narrative & plot twists•	Several chapters in one PoV lets the story settle better (as opposed to alternating PoV chapters) •	Magic system – I'm dual here, as it’s not very clear how this magic works and how you learn it (or just know it, in some characters' case it seems) 
CONS
: •	Way too many secondary characters, some with similarly confusing names, some you get to know better because they have a little more details attached, some just pass through you mind and don’t stick; the way one of these secondary characters has the stage for a part of a chapter in one book, is then forgotten and then appears several books later and you're supposed to know who they are; •	Too many descriptions for my taste (how many times one can read very thorough depictions of a kitchen and everything in it, or of a stable, or an inn interior, or of petticoats and dress colours and cuts) •	A major disappointment was the way many of the interesting characters got discarded without any regard in the Last Battle – what upsets me isn’t that they were killed (I totally realize that some beloved characters were supposed to die to mark such an important event), but that it was only mentioned in passing and there was little to no reaction to these deaths..
