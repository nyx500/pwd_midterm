I started reading this series when I was 11.Today, at 23, I managed to get a copy off my friend a day early. I got it just after work, and I've had a few hours to myself. It's midnight, and I haven't stopped reading. I'm sure I'll have to blog about the immensity of this series, and what it's meant to me, once I'm done, but for now, I just wanted to give a quick, spoiler-free update: this book is essentially a 900 page battle sequence involving dozens of characters, and spanning an entire world.I have two main reactions to this (though I'm only halfway through). The first is courtesy of 11-year-old me reaching through time and space to say: HOLY SHIT, THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME. FUCK. YEAH.The second is the slightly more measured, 23-year-old student of writing, who is quite simply in awe of this staggering achievement, this colossal work of art, woven of so many delicate strands. The level of detail, the timing, the pacing, to bring it to this point...HOLY SHIT, THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME.Robert Jordan, you magnificent bastard, I love you.EDIT: I finished the book a few hours ago. I'm so very glad that I was able to use work as a means to extend the reading experience beyond one burned-out marathon. This way, over two and a half days, I was able to space it out and luxuriate in it. If ever there was a book to be savoured, it is this one. It was, for me, the greatest storytelling experience I've ever had, and likely will ever have. Three decades in the making, twelve years in the reading, such an astonishing journey. It defies belief. How, with such astronomical expectations, was it pulled off?I don't know. Likely, I never will, and I'm not sure I even want to - some mysteries are necessary. My reactions, in case you're wondering, are the same at the end as they were midway through. And okay, yes, there were some tears, it wasn't all manly exclamations but so what? Lastly, 'A Silence Like Screaming' remains my favourite chapter title ever. Wonderful, wonderful stuff.
