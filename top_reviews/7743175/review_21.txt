Seeing quite a few of my Goodreads buddies finishing this series together and posting their reviews made me feel that I should at least pen some parting words. I've read this series back in the days when I wasn't inclined to write reviews, which I found take practice and inspiration. The Wheel of Time was quite a mixed experience for me overall. There were books which were great, some which were good and a few which were just passable. Then there are those that I've decided to skip entirely (i.e Book 8 to 11 before picking up from The Gathering Storm) thereby relying on Tor.com's reread thread to keep myself abreast of developments, which was not very much except for a very significant event at the climax of Winter's Heart. This climactic, final book was an 
epic culmination
 of a massive story and oft times aggravating development of characters whom I have a love-hate relationship with. It was with a heavy heart that I've read the final few pages of this enormous series and finally call this journey done. And till today, I still find the title of this tome to be one of the best (for a last book of a series) I've ever come across.
