It is difficult to know what to say about this final Wheel of Time book. It really was one of the very best instalments of the whole series. The story was exciting and engaging from start to finish. A lot ton cool stuff happened and it was packed with a number of shocking and emotional moments. My overall opinion is that this was a good way to conclude the series. That said, I was not delighted by the way a small number of key story arcs were concluded and that has left me with a tiny feeling of dissatisfaction with the conclusion to the Wheel of Time series. All in all I do still think this series deserves to be considered as one of the true greats in the fantasy genre. Few series have the depth and level of world building of Jordan's fantastic and truly epic Wheel of Time. Jordan had a few flaws as an author but he created a vivid world that had plenty of depth and populated it with a ton of fascinating characters. He also had an engaging storytelling style. I thought Sanderson worked out perfect as a replacement for Jordan. He did a few things different but on the whole I think he kept the feel of WoT and I doubt anyone else could have finished the story so well. I'm actually a little sad that this is the last WoT book. The conclusion was final enough to work as a good ending but this world definitely had a lot more stories that were worth telling. I'd have loved for Sanderson to have written a few spin-off series set in this world! Rating: 5 stars! Despite a few issues with the conclusion I do still think this is a book well worth a 5 star rating. Audio Note: It goes without saying that Kramer and Reading gave flawless performances.
