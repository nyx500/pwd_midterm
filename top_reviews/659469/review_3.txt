This is the graphic novel version of Tolkien's The Hobbit, or There and Back Again. I read it only days after completing the original text and so really noticed both how faithful it was to the former story and how much of Tolkien's original quotes were included.It feels like a far daintier and quieter tale than the original, despite this faithfulness. It is always interesting, in any retelling, to see what an individual chose to deliver as the most important features, and discovering this was what I most enjoyed here.The movie adaptations are even bleaker and more despairing than the book, but this feels more hopeful and full of light than either of them. I already knew I was going to love the bones of the story but I love the direction this took and how the focus remained on Bilbo throughout, rather than the feats of the other characters.The artwork from David Wenzel took an early pastoral focus and beautiful landscapes continued throughout. The colour scheme remained muted and I thought it the perfect match for the tone of the book. I enjoyed viewing the illustrations as much as I did reading the story.
