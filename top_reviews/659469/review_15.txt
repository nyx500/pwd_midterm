So, graphic novels seem to either tell the story through the art, tell it with good art and story, or go the route of this rendering of the Hobbit and tell it with a whole lotta words and art that seems a bit of an afterthought. Don’t get me wrong, when it comes to Tolkien, we all want the text-it’s great. And the art here is simple and doesn’t pull away from the story. At times it’s bit jumbled (when Bilbo initially gets separated from his dwarven companions in the mountain with the goblins) and it certainly isn’t overly compelling, but it works. I’d like to see a version that has a more dramatic depiction such as the art by Donato Giancola who illustrated the cover of this edition. Still can’t beat this terrific tale.
