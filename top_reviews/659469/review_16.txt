I forgot to add this book; I read it recently because my boys were interested in it and I wanted to make sure it was not too complex or scary. I never read it as a child. I LOVED it! What a great story and well-written. My oldest son read it after me, and my second son is reading it now (as a matter of fact, as we speak!). They are begging to start the Lord of the Rings Trilogy next. Ordered the series in paperback yesterday . . . :)
