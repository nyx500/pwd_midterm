Reread update 11/7/19:This reread solidified that not only is BLLB my favorite book in the series, this is my favorite book of all time. Ever. Ever written. Trying to talk about this book in my reread vlog literally almost made me start crying. YIKES I love it.Updated review 10/14/17:I was curious if rereading this series would change my favorite book, but it definitely didn't. I knew from the first couple of chapters that this one just stands out from the rest for me. Maybe it is because it has the absolute best side characters of the entire series, or because there is moderately less angst than in books 2 or 4, but something about this one speaks to me. I do also think it has to do with the fact that some of my absolute FAVORITE character development happens in this installment. The first time I read this series, this is the first book that made me cry. It is emotional, and you really dig below the surface of every single character and I think that's impressive, considering this is the shortest book of the series. Anyway, I cried again when I read this. I adore it with my whole heart.
