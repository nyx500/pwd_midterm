"His noble and optimistic friend was slowly opening his eyes and seeing the world for what it was, and it was filthy and violent, and profane, and unfair." It's definitely the characters that make this series for me.The actual plot and story have to be taken with a handful of salt, as a good 75% of the stuff that happens isn't explained, and you just have to roll with it.Which is fine - if you are in the mood to be entertained without asking too many questions, and thankfully I was.The hunt for Glendower continues on; but things for Blue and the Raven Boys become ever more dangerous. Maura is missing, the Gray man's ex-employer arrives to claim what he believes is his - and to wreak havoc with his psycho wife.My love for Adam Parrish in this one knows no bounds! He is the most precious human being and I love him with every ounce of my being!"He wondered if he was going to go through each year of his life thinking about how stupid he was the year before." Also his scenes with Ronan are what I live for. Actual proof that Ronan has a heart of gold when it comes to Adam Parrish <3Noah had less presence in this one which was sad because I love him, but the scenes he was in were wonderful; and Gansey needs no explanation - he is just Gansey, lovable, posh, sweet Gansey!"It won't hurt me. This will be scary, but it won't hurt me. But fear hurt too." Ultimately - the third book had a lot more scary scenes, monsters and villians, I am looking forward to wrapping it up with The Raven King!"Blue was perfectly aware that it was possible to have a friendship that wasn't all encompassing, that wasn't blinding, deafening, maddening, quickening. It was just that now she'd had this kind, she didn't want the other."
