Will Roma and Juliette have a new fate in this updated retelling of the classic?Set in Shanghai in 1927, there are two feuding families, the White Flowers and the Scarlets. Roma Montagov is the heir to the White Flowers while Juliette Cai is the heir to the Scarlets. These star-crossed lovers are determined to find a way to protect the city from various forces - the monsters, politics, and even their own families. What fate lies in store for these two?Our Violent Ends is the second book from Chloe Gong following her debut novel, These Violent Delights. Although I did read the first book about a year ago, Our Violent Ends heavily referenced to some events from the first book that I regretted not rereading it before diving into the second book.Ms. Gong is oozing with talent. She has such a vast vocabulary and a very strong command of verbs. When I started to get bored, I would highlight the words that we all know but don't use very often in our everyday language. In this book, Ms. Gong went beyond the traditional fan fiction and crafted a new story.The book could have benefited from better pacing, and the book was overly long at nearly 500 pages. There were too many different sub-plots going on. There were multiple power struggles, multiple love stories, and multiple battles and enemies. The ending was also a huge disappointment, not very memorable. It almost felt like the author ran out of steam by the end. Overall, although Our Violent Ends dragged at times, Ms. Gong's prose was quite delightful, and it was refreshing to see the author craft an original tale.2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jonesâ€™s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta
