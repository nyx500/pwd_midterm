I am an empty shell of my former self 😃Chloe you're paying for my therapy bills <3This is the 2nd time in my life that I’ve been this heartbroken over a book. Literally it was a full out sob-fest for me reading this.I don't think I will ever truly recover and really I should've known better but of course I foolishly hoped. My heart has been stomped on, torn into pieces and thrown into an explosion. I actually wasn't expecting to be this heartbroken like WHY did I go ahead and fall in love with every single one of these characters?? I was literally setting myself up for pain *sobs* But oh, isn't that the beauty of reading? To fall in love only to have your heart broken.Just the way I got trolled so badly, like some of the events actually had me thinking otherwise but oh no no🤡 I am now and forever depressed™I can literally imagine this was how Chloe was when she wrote OVE:The monster of Shanghai who?? I only know Miss Chloe Gong *sobbing*

"A rose is a rose, even by another name. But we choose whether we will offer beauty to the world, or if we will use our thorns to sting."

1927 Shanghai and the city is at the brink of complete chaos. Sightings of monsters have re-emerged, the Communists have grown more bold, and the two gangs ruling the city have gone at each other out for more blood than usual. Meanwhile, Juliette Cai is having to watch her every step in the face of Tyler--her cousin just waiting to find reason to declare Juliette a traitor and become heir to the Scarlet Gang--and watch for Roma Montagov who is out for revenge after the death of Marshall Seo. Oh and also worry about the appearances of monsters and state of the city. Life is stressful for Juliette :(I won't go into anymore details of the plot because ✨spoilers✨ BUT OMG THE WAY IT GRIPPED ME FROM THE START?? It took me a while to get into TVD but this!! Literally there wasn't a moment in this book I didn't love. I was a ball of anxiety the whole time. of course my heart was also dying because of the wholesomeness and very few precious scenes And like I actually dropped my expectations for this because I thought and feared it wouldn't be that good but oh how very, very wrong I was.The characters were so much more fleshed out here?? I already liked them before in TVD but I was just so so in love with them all here to the point where I'd straight up be PRAYING they'd survive😭 Benedikt, Marshall, Kathleen... I didn't think it was possible to adore them all so much, my heart is so full of love. And don't even get me started on the two stars who went from enemies-to-lovers-to-enemies in TVD sdfsfgs THE ANGST.

"She was not fighting for love. She was protecting her own, everyone else's be damned."

THIS QUEEN. Did I believe it to be possible for Juliette to be even more of a queen than she already was? No. Did it happen anyways? HELL YES. All the pain she had to go through, making Roma believe that she had actually killed Marshall and subjecting herself to his hatred *sobbing* And it was all to protect him and the city. And then also having to deal with that bastard Tyler along with her own family and people having not so much faith in her ugh. Juliette hiding away any signs of weakness because people were always watching was so heartbreaking. She couldn't give her people any more reason to doubt her then they already do. Kathleen being the only one she could be herself with, always there for her🥺You know that moment when you have so much to say that you don't know how to write it all out? That's me right now. Just know if you loved Juliette before, you will definitely love her even more now.

"And maybe he was a coward. He was a coward who wouldn't stop loving a wicked thing."

ROMA, MY LOVE. Oh my god, he's such a cinnamon roll that must be protected at all costs. The hatred and love he felt towards Juliette hurt my soul. Even after seeing Juliette "kill" Marshall, a small part of him believed that there was more to it AND HOW RIGHT THAT FEELING WAS. Of course, Juliette tried as hard as ever to extinguish that feeling but still sdfdgsgds THE ANGST BETWEEN THE TWO. 

"Only he knew if he screamed I hate you, what he really meant was I love you. I still love you so much that I hate you for it."

Enemies-to-lovers-to-enemies at its peak😩The first book's romance wasn't a really big focus BUT HERE?? God, the tension was literally killing me. So many times my heart stopped because of these two😭 The two heirs of rival gangs who dared to love one another <3(credit: @polarts_)

"And if you are gunned down because you want to fight a war that doesn't belong to you, I will never forgive this city. I will tear it down to pieces, and you will be to blame!

When the ship is in a heated argument and then one of them breaks and yells "because I love you!" sdfsfgsgs MY HEART I LOVED THIS SCENE SO MUCH IT WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED. The only crime was that IT TOOK SO LONG for the confession😭 like the last 70 pages?? that is just too cruelThe amount of pain I was in during this whole book like not only did I have suffer watching Roma and Juliette BUT ALSO BENEDIKT WAS SO BROKEN IT HURT. Believing Marshall to be dead completely destroyed him and the whole time throughout I was just screaming "he's alive Benedikt, he's alive!!" That was honestly just true torture knowing Marshall was alive. Benedikt being so reckless about his life like no Ben what are you doing😭 And meanwhile, there's Marshall -- AKA MY PRECIOUS BEAN -- who missed everyone, but of course Ben the most🥺 The two being apart pained me so much, like why can't everyone just be happy?? Is that too much to ask for?? Stan BenMars forever <3(credit: @Kirisy_art)Also let it be remembered that Benedikt is and forever will be the only sensible one of the whole group. He literally stopped each and everyone of them (in terms of Roma, Juliette, and Marshall) from trying to kill themselves please he really got sick of the self-sacrificing😭

"Keep fighting for love. It is worth it."

ALSO LET ME JUST SCREAM ABOUT JULIETTE AND MARSHALL'S FRIENDSHIP. It was so beautiful, sweet, and just everything omg I loved it so so so much. Their banter was like one between siblings and the way my heart was about to burst😭 IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. Literally all the relationships between the characters were so so amazing, I can't choose a favourite it's impossible.

"And yet wasn't that the root of all hatred? Wasn't that what made it so vicious? There was never a reason. Never a good one. Never a fair one."

Kathleen Lang, please marry me. She's literally such a genuine and kind-hearted person just how?? Such a morally good character and the development she went through by the end of this book???🥺 I was actually about to cry. Also, Juliette and her just have the most wholesome friendship ever, there was moment between them that made me so emotional, get a friend like Kathleen😭 And I can so bet on my life that either her or Alisa is going to be the main character in Foul Lady Fortune!! (im thinking Alisa more tho)Also this is totally off-topic but I'm WHEEZING at how I said at the end of my These Violent Delights review how my loyalty will forever lie with the Scarlet Gang... HAHA no the Scarlet Gang can go to hell :)Correction: My loyalty forever lies with Roma and Juliette <3 They are true leaders.

"Keep fighting for love. Juliette had wanted to be selfish, had wanted to run. But this was their love⁠—violent and bloody. This city was their love. They couldn't deny their upbringings as the heirs of Shanghai, as two pieces of a throne. What was left of their love if they rejected that? How could they live with themselves, look at each other, knowing they had been presented a choice and gone against who they were at the core."

I legit can't even write their names without tears blurring my vision. LIKE I'M ACTUALLY STRUGGLING WRITING THIS RIGHT NOW TRYING TO SEE. It's so heartbreaking my heart physically hurts. All they wanted was to live happy, alone and free from the blood feud ohmygod AND THEY EVEN HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN AWAY, but oh Roma and Juliette were too noble for their own good and I both love and hate them for that. They just wanted to love each other freely. They just wanted peace, and they couldn't even have that. I'M SOBBING. They gave up their lives for the city that caused them so much pain. PLEASE HOW ARE ROMA AND JULIETTE SO GOOD??And like obviously it shouldn't have been a surprise they were going to die considering it was a retelling of R&J. Like even the foreshadowing made it obvious BUT I STILL FOOLISHLY HOPED CHLOE WOULD SPARE OUR HEARTS. It wouldn't have been an accurate retelling if she hadn't followed through BUT STILL😭😭 It pains me so so much and I just want to crawl into a hole and die because those two so deserved all the happiness in this world.I WANTED BENMARS AND ROMAJULIETTE TO LIVE NEXT TO EACH OTHER, HAVE KIDS, AND GROW OLD TOGETHER HAPPY THIS ISN'T FAIR, THIS PAIN IS ILLEGAL. I love that Roma and Juliette got to at least die together holding hands and knowing that both of their cousins were dead at least but omg I will never recover from this. And the gangs were disbanded because of their deaths so at least that's something😭They were only married for one day before they died *sobbing* Chloe you're too cruel.

"In this life they had been born enemies. In this life they had blood for miles between them, wide enough to run a river, deep enough to forge a valley. In the next, maybe there would be peace."

═══*.·:·.☽✧ ❀ ✧☾.·:·.*═══This review was a chaotic mess, so you can tell just how much this book destroyed me. It's been months since a book made me feel this way and I don't know if I should be thanking or cursing Chloe. Either way, STAN THIS QUEEN FOR MAKING ME FEEL LIKE THIS. I will forever remember each of these lovable characters and absolutely can't wait for 
 Foul Lady Fortune
