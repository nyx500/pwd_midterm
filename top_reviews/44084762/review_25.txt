hey chloe gong! you did it, you absolutely broke me!edit: the emotional pain i am still in months after finishing this sequel with thinking about the character dynamics and the insane high stakes of a plot.05/21/21: this was truly a stunningly done sequel and conclusion, just beyond words. the angst went up an extreme notch naturally in comparison to tvd and the tensions with gangs along with political movements brought much suspense having readers on the edge of their seat, either anticipating or terrified for what was to come as you turn each page. and of course, major plot twists on top of the angst and suspense and the banter we've come to love between the characters still woven in at perfect times for relief while stress levels while reading this story run at an all time high. our violent ends was simply such an emotional rollercoaster, took my head for a spin finishing at 6am in tears especially with how chloe tossed around my feelings back and forth like that. full rtc maybe when i can think up my thoughts coherently. all i'll say more is that i cannot wait for what foul lady fortune brings to this world chloe has created.
