May 28 2014HOLY.FUCKING.SHIT.I knew this book was going to be good but I never expected it to go to that level of epic. It had EVERYTHING I wanted, resolved a lot of stuff, advanced several things that have been stagnant for a while and we had DENARIANS again. God, I love them. They're the creepiest, nastiest villains I've come across in literature lately (bar the Naagloshi). The only thing that I was a bit disappointed at was the lack of Toe-mas. Be prepared for loads of feels btw. Might be the best book in the series so far.And now I'm sad cause I have 1-2 years ahead of me until the next one.Time to read the rest of the series again.GOD.May 27 2014This is moi today:May 22 2014I can't. I NEED IT NOW.May 18th 2014Gahhhhhhhttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show...What else do you need world? If the Rothfuss declares TDF his favourite series ever, then it only proves I've been right all along ^_^I'm really excited about Skin Game I've bought the audiobook and the hardback because I can't stand waiting for it to be delivered. So I'll listen to James reading it to me and then when the physical copy arrives I'll admire it on my bookshelf.And read it again ^_^June 30 2013BRING IT ON
