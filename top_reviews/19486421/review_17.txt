This is Harry Dresden.  This is Harry the Bolshevik Muppet.* . .Put them both in dusters and there really isn't much difference, especially now that Mab is pulling Dresden's strings. They even have the same hair.*by the way, if you're not up on muppet pop culture, the Bolshevik muppet's name really is Crazy Harry. He is described on the wiki as, "An unkempt figure with wild eyes and a mad cackle, he delights in blowing things up." Well, shoot. I dropped by to see if it came out in the next few months. It doesn't.Despite a certain amount of ambivalence about Faustian bargains and cold days, I'm dying to read this for a rather random reason. If the books stay true to pattern, then this is a Denarian book, so hopefully one of my biggest questions since Small Favor will finally be answered: who, who picked up the Denarian coin? Seriously, it wasn't a very big helicopter. Practically a locked-room mystery. I vote Sanya, because that provides a certain nice symmetry. But I have no idea.I wonder if Charity will go after him with a frying pan, a steak knife, or a battleaxe. I vote all three.Otherwise, I want to know:--Hey, remember the Fomorians terrorizing Chicago? About them...do tell.--Remember how the White Council had been taken over by Black Councilites? How's that going, then?--Cowl and Kumori: totally think they're Justin and Elaine, but I'd like to find out for sure.--Who had Nic on a timetable in #5?--Who sideswiped Dresden in #8 and bombed Murph's car in #9?--And anyway, considering our info came from Maeve, what actually happened in #8? Still waiting for an explanation of the fetches.--Who fixed Little Chicago in #8? (Please, please don't say God.)--And anyway, how does one explain to a mother that one has trapped her daughter in a horrific and inexorable process of dehumanization until ultimate destruction of self? I suspect the explanation starts with "Uh....".--Please, please, do not let the title pun mean what I think it does.
