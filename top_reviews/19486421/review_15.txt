Parcour! If anyone was new to urban fantasy this is the first series I’d recommend. It was what I started with myself. As many before me have said, this series just gets better and better. I know that many didn’t like books 13 and 14 as much, but I’ve loved them all!One of the things I love is the payoff from previous books. Character development over the series is phenomenal, not only for Harry Dresden, but all the rest of the cast too. With each book, more of the back story is threaded in. There are no wasted pages and no down time with any of the books, and particularly not in this book. It’s great to see Michael et al back in play and Butters too.Some fantasy fans don’t really like urban fantasy, but I’d say that if you’re ever going to like an urban fantasy, this is the one! I have slowly over a couple of years worked my way through the series. Too much happens in each one to want to rush through the whole lot too quickly. And boy Am I glad I paced myself because it’s only now that I have to join the queue of Harry Dresden fans waiting impatiently for the next book.And the audio is excellent. It’s only the last couple of books I’ve picked up on audio, so now at least I can treat myself to the whole series again in audio.In case you haven’t guessed..Recommended.
