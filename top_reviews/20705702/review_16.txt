Re-read! I needed a pick me up and this was perfect. 12/3/17Rogan POV from Burn for Me (Part 1)http://www.ilona-andrews.com/rogan-po...   5 starsIf there is something Ilona and Gordon Andrews excel at is world building. And once again they weaved their magic and I fell for it! I love this book! Crushing hard on Mad Rogan and Nevada, in the modern vernacular totally shipping them!Nevada Baylor is a strong young woman that's been struggling to keep her family and business afloat. She does her job, tries to uphold the laws and keep the hard earned state of calm her family finally has. Unfortunately for her she's given a case to retrieve a very powerful magic user, a Prime, or forfeit everything she has worked so hard for. It's suicide but she sees no other option. I absolutely adored Nevada. A strong heroine, absolute loyalty to her family and a very strong sense of ethics, of right and wrong.We are introduced to her family which I also loved and I'm looking forward to read much more of them. I have such a weak spot for her Grandma! I wish my Grandmother was like her. Nevada decides on a course of action but guess who disrupts everything by kidnapping her? None other than Connor “Mad” Rogan.Mad Rogan is also an extremely powerful Prime and has the same mission as Nevada but for his own reasons. He decides the best thing to do is to kidnap her and find out what she knows but the whole thing backfires on him. There's a reason he is called Mad and you see it from the beginning. Very imposing figure, dangerously attractive and just plain dangerous. He's also insanely hot, intense, commanding and swoon worthy to the nth degree. There's undeniable attraction between Nevada and Rogan, the pull and push of their chemistry makes an amazing read I couldn't put down. I wanted to know how they'll catch the bad guy, I wanted to know if they'll get together. I wanted to read more of Grandma! I kept reading until I devoured the whole book and I still want more. The second book cannot come soon enough!I am fangirling on Ilona Andrews and I'm not ashamed to say it.
