BUUURRRRNNNNN!Not a real review, but this book is eons better than that cover. I don't know how Ilona Andrews keeps coming up with a never-ending set of AMAZING urban fantasy realms without them feeling stale. This writing team is everything. The second book can't come fast enough, and I actually think I like it better than the Kate Daniels series. Winner.
