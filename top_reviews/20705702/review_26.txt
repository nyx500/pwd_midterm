Re-read in Audio this time.  HELL YESSSS TO THIS SERIES!!! Lemme tell ya, Mad Rogan has some mad skills.I GIVES IT 10 STARSI love Ilona Andrews books and this book was no exception. It's like the author sprinkled crack on the pages, I just couldn't stop reading. I didn't want it to end. EVER. Seriously, were do they come up with this brilliant, magical stuff? I love the writing, all the humor, the action, the romance and everything about the characters. It's really easy to relate to Nevada, she's such a likable character. She's strong and brave, but also vulnerable.I adore Nevada's family, especially her grandma! That lady is hilarious!!I hope there's going to be lots of her family in the upcoming books, I enjoy immensely reading about them. ''Mad'' Rogan. *Sighs* Kinda psycho and oh so so hottttt.
