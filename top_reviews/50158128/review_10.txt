Unpopular opinion time. I hate this feeling. But I’m feeling so conflicted, it’s unreal. I broke up with YA fantasy a while ago. I’ve been sticking to authors that do it well enough for me and have been reluctant to rekindle that relationship with the newer YA fantasy books that have been getting released these past few years.Now, I did perhaps place a bit too much hope and expectation on this book. The expectation that this story might possibly revive my love for YA fantasy again, like my good ol’ young'un days. I’m not sure whether this was achieved. And it’s not to say that there wasn’t some great aspects to this story. The first half or so had me almost captivated. It seemed to put a unique twist to the typical trope we see in fantasy: someone is saving the world from evil and destruction. I enjoyed the writing, the African folklore, the magic system, the world building (till it got confusing), the themes of trauma and mental health amongst other things and the characterisation. But then all the reasons that made me lose interest in this genre in the first place started appearing. The plot took centre stage. It was too fast paced for my liking. We’re jumping from one thing to the next and it didn’t allow for me to absorb the story and take in the world. The times that it did slow down, I was getting bombarded with world-building elements that were so boringly told, it took me out of the story instead of feeling immersed in it. I couldn’t latch on. It was doing too much and it read messy, so my interest began to wane. I think I should go back to breaking up with YA fantasy (particularly the new ones) for real this time. I want to say it’s me. But it’s you too.
