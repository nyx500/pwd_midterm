with such a pretty cover, i knew i wouldnt be able to stay away from this. and i love how well the cover art reflects the inner story. its really quite perfect. ive read some of the 3 star reviews and it seems the reason why this didnt work out for some readers is exactly the reason why i enjoyed it. this story is very much plot driven with fast pacing. this is totally the kind of narrative i prefer. yes, that does tend to create some info-dumpy moments when it comes to world-building, but i honestly dont mind the trade off. the magic system is cool, the concept of the ray and council members is unique, the culture is super rich, the characters feel real, and the writing is easy to read. there is just so much going for this story and i had a really good time with it overall. very easy to recommend!â†  4 stars
