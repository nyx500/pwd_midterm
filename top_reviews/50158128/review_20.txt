  ‘Raybearer’ is a book I knew I would like right after hearing the author’s dedication:  “For the kid scanning fairy tales for a hero with a face like theirs. And for the girls whose stories we compressed into pities and wonders, triumphs and cautions, without asking, even once, for their names.”  Sure enough, Jordan Ifueko’s vivid and smooth writing style did not disappoint! The world she presented is rich in creativity, history, and intricacy. I especially loved the references to West-African folklore and culture as these add an extra layer of freshness and originality. The magic system infused into this world was also complex yet easy to grasp. Besides having characters with special powers, Jordan introduces the concept of the Ray - a lifelong bond that connects the characters in a remarkable way.  My only issue with the world-building is that it was mainly conveyed in bursts of information. This was particularly noticeable at the start where readers are bombarded with lots of information about the world and its main character. Whilst, Jordan certainly tries to deliver the information creatively in bite-sized pieces, I could not help but clock each torrent of new information.  Our heroine, Tarisai, is an amazing character who is caring and loving but also clever and strong-willed. As a proud woman of colour, I certainly love the representation her character brings to the genre of Young Adult (YA) Fantasy. However, I was somewhat disappointed by the number of YA tropes found in Tarisai’s character.  She is yet another female lead with childhood trauma that they have to overcome in order to find their place and path in the world. And, of course this path turns out to be far bigger and more important than it initially appears. This does not mean that Tarisai’s journey in this book was uninteresting or predictable. In fact, since this book spans several years, I ended up feeling really connected and invested in her character.  What I love most about Tarisai’s journey is how it is used to creatively explore various themes such as patriarchy, revenge, family trauma and colonialism. These themes help create a strong character-driven story that certainly kept me engaged.  “She would have us be masters of our own fates, whether we like it or not.”  Ultimately, ‘Raybearer’ is a strong West-African inspired YA debut with a fascinating world and main character. While the story within its pages may not be fast-paced or action-packed, it cleverly explores various themes which strengthen the character-driven plot. Fortunately, the next book is already out so I have that to look forward to! ___________________________RTC @ BookerificationRating: 4 stars  “we can't defeat monsters we won't face”
