Read my full review on my book blog, The Quiet Pond.Wow... what an amazing book. This is the sort of book where how long it is doesn't matter - once you're pulled into its incredible story, you're on the ride and you'll follow Ifueko no matter where she takes the story. I'm in awe of this debut. - Follows Tarisai, a girl who wants nothing more than the love and warmth of family. When her mother, known as 'The Lady', sends her to compete with other children to become part of the Crown Prince's Council, she also sends her on a mission to kill him. - So, the above is only but a glimpse of the story. Because what develops and follows is this amazing story about found family, justice, revenge, culture, love in all forms... so many things.- I really feel like I've gone on this incredible journey. The storytelling is PHENOMENAL; the pacing is one of the best I've read in a long time (I can't believe that this book is only 368 pages for the amount of detail in this book), the way Ifueko weaves all these plot points to come together in a powerful and immaculate way... wow. I'm just! in awe!- The worldbuilding was sublime. The world felt so immense, never underdeveloped nor 'too mysterious to make up for depth' and the magic - called 'hollows' - was amazing.- Oh the characters. Wow! It feels like I grew up with these characters. All were so complex and interesting and so well developed. Again! I'm in awe!I've probably used the words amazing so much because, guess what! IT'S AMAZING.
