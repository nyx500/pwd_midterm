This book is a hidden gem, alright! I was completely into it from the very first chapter. What caught my attention first was the beautiful writing and the whimsical setting. Then I fell in love with the rest of it😍What’s this book about? Raybearer follows Tarisai, a young girl bound by a magical wish by her absent and distant mother: kill the Crown Prince. When Tarisai is sent to the capital to compete to be part of the Crown Prince's council, Tarisai finally finds what she had always craved: love, belonging, connection.➪ First of all, the world of Raybearer has become one of my absolute favorite high fantasy worlds. It’s just so rich and beautiful. It’s inspired by West African folklore and I was so completely engrossed in the tutsu sprites, the Ray magic and the idea of Raybearers and their council of Eleven, the alagbatos and the animals and the vibrant sitting...I loved the culture and the history behind every Arit realm. I loved their traditions and their fashions and all the diversity. What made it even more beautiful is the lovely writing style, it made everything come to life. The descriptions were so warm and rich that the world felt like a burst of colors. I was fascinated by every little detail.➪ The magic system was so fascinating. I found the idea of Raybearers and their council of Eleven so interesting and unlike any I’ve ever read before. Hear me out: Raybearers are the rulers of the Arit empire and each Raybearer has a Council of Eleven who will swear to love him and be loyal only to him. And for every council member the Raybearer anoints into his council, the Raybearer will be immune to one death. Once the Council of Eleven is formed, they will be united together by the magic of the Ray, allowing them to join minds together with the Raybearer. How awesome is that? What’s even more fascinating is that every council member needs to have a Hallow, which is a kind of unique power. It can be anything from being able to see the memories of every object or person you touch, to being able to heal with a song, to fly or change shape, etc...I absolutely LOVED this concept. This book is just so magical😍➪ You love the found family trope? then THIS book is for you! Tarisai will form a family with her council siblings, each one from a different Arit realm, and I just absolutely loved their relationship together especially Tarisai, Sanjeet, Kirah and Dayo’s relationship with each other. They really were like a family and they cared and loved each other so much! They would do anything for each other🥺❤️➪ Tarisai was an AMAZING main character. We start with her as an 11 year-old girl, preparing to become a council member, and we follow her through the years until she’s 16 years-old. I thought that she was such a smart, strong, loyal and kind heroine. She would do anything for her new family; especially after she was isolated and left alone for most of her childhood. She loved Dayo and her council siblings so fiercely that I had to admire her. I never once thought she was immature or that she made stupid decisions; she was 16 years old but it didn’t feel like she was that young and I loved that! ➪ The plot was very well-written and the book was packed with action. A lot of things happened through out the book and there were quite a few plot twists that left me reeling and made me want to never put the it down and just FINISH IT. It was so freaking enjoyable and I did not want it to end. ➪ There was also romance and it was so freaking cute but it did not take over the plot or felt like it was overshadowing the important things happening which I also loved. Also it isn’t your typical YA book where the MC falls in love with the Prince. It’s so different and unexpected in a good way😍➪ I wanted to highlight a part of the culture that I loved which is telling stories through songs. Griots were singers of histories and stories, the most sacred of Arit priests. There were little snippets of lovely poetry throughout the book that I thought were a very lovely addition to the story. ➪ All in all, reading this book was a wonderful experience. It was so good and enjoyable, I did not want to put it down. I truly loved everything; from the world and the magic to the characters and their relationships and stories to the beautiful writing style and the engaging plot...This book SHOULD NOT be missed!😍❤️
