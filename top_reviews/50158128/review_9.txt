A really unique and intricately plotted YA fantasy that was like nothing I've ever read. I absolutely love when I am surprised by a book, and this one definitely did that. The worldbuilding and magic system were wonderfully creative, my only caveat being the stand-in cultures = world cultures; that was definitely my least favorite element. (However, if the reasoning was to show the breadth of the empire, I get it. I just thought it was a bit lazy.) But the primary setting and culture of our protagonist and the emperor was lovely, particularly Storyland. I loved the mythos of this world, and how it differed from culture to culture, and perhaps from the truth. It made the world feel real and lived in. I adored the antagonist and the complicated loyalties and relationships there, and appreciated that characters were allowed to remain complex and not easily categorized or dismissed. My only real complaint was the pacing lagged in some places, which was surprising since the story was non-stop action. So, really, YMMV on that. Bottom line, I highly recommend. A wonderful story.
