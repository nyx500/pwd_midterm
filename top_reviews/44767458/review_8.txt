60 pages in and then i DNFed. world building is literally shit in this book. i wanted to read this book just in case i accidentally bumped into Timothée or Zendaya but i really tried being ✨that bitch✨ but ✨that bitch✨ was not trying to be me. horrible, unreadable, and should be illegal but think about it, if this book was written by a woman i just know i’d be able to actually read it cover to cover. never again
