3.5 stars. This was a decent book as part of the ongoing Mercy Thompson urban fantasy series, and worth reading for those who are already into this series, but not one of my favorites in this series. It combines two or three plotlines:First, we have Mercy's ongoing issues with her failure to be fully accepted by her mate Adam's werewolf pack, which become Adam's issues. This leads to some insurrection in the ranks and a series of mixed martial arts fights for position and rank in the pack, including that of the Alpha. The disclosure of the conspiracy and the martial arts fights were interesting reading - Briggs said she worked with her husband to write the fight scenes in as authentic a way as possible, and it shows. Unfortunately, this continuing plot about the pack's issues with Mercy has passed its Sell By date, for my money. We're kind of treading water here now.Second, there's the "Silver Borne" artifact plot: A special book was loaned to Mercy by a bookstore owner in a previous book, and when she tries to return it, the bookstore is closed, the owner is missing, and Mercy is worried about him. This ties into the third plotline, a personal crisis that Mercy's old friend Samuel is having. He's at the end of his rope emotionally, and his wolf "Sam" (the werewolf half of his personality) takes over their body to prevent a crisis ... but that's only a temporary solution. So Mercy has three problems, all of which are hitting the boiling point.My favorite part of the book was the Sam/Samuel part; the werewolf politicking and fighting would have been more fun if it were more fresh. The Silver Borne artifact part of the plot wasn't at all memorable.
