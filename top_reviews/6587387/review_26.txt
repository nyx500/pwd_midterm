Seriously, this is one of the most kick ass Urban Fantasy series out there. Mercy is the best type of heroine in that she's so atypical, it's impossible not to love her. She's more likeable than Rachel from the Hollows series by Kim Harrison, she's more down to earth than the pseudo romance-slash-UF series heroines out there. She's the best friend I never had, and considering all the beasties and baddies coming after her, that may be a good thing. In this installment, the bond between her and Adam is tested over and over. If I ever hand any doubts about their devotion or the strength of the mating bond between this unlikely duo, then all my questions were answered in Silver Borne. Not to mention the entirely new spin she puts on a handful of characters already fitted into the story. So much happens in each Mercy book, I can't even begin to name it all. Suffice it to say, this series is effing amazing.I'll end with a favorite quote from Adam to Mercy:"He sighed. "I don't think an apology will do, Mercy. Because an apology implies that you wouldn't do it again. And, under the circumstances, you wouldn't do anything differently, would you?""No.""And you shouldn't have to apologize for being right," he said with a sigh. "Much as I'd like to tell you differently."Love that guy :D
