Mercy’s adventures continue! When she gets a call with a message from Phin to take care of the thing he gave her she can’t help but do some investigating. But everywhere she goes to look for Phin she sees the Fae and realizes she may be getting in over her head again (which of course doesn’t stop her). At the same time Samuel is losing his will to live and with a werewolf that is highly dangerous. I love Mercy’s character and love to see her relationship with Adam develop as she figures out how a coyote can fit into a werewolf pack.
