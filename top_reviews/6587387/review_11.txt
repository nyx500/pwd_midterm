Another great instalment! This book involved the fae and the vamps didn't even get a bit part! It's interesting that when I read the first book in this series, I was almost put off continuing by all the werewolf politics. Here in book 5, there is a lot of werewolf politicking, but now that I'm happily ensconced in the series, it was interesting to read.
