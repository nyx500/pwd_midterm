I really enjoyed this book. My passion for this sub-genre has been waning because there has been SO much of it out there, but Mercy is one of the originals, and a really good heroine, working-class, compassionate and never perfect. I think I actually enjoyed this installment in the series better than the last, the characters were really fleshed out, the mystery was well-plotted. Nothing HUGE happens, but being comfortable with the world and the other characters is nothing to sniff at. Enjoyable, and all in all still one of my favorite Urban Fantasy series!
