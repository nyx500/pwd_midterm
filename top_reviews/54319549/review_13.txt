 4 stars Blood and Ash drinking game:take a shot every time Poppy wants to stab Cas or when Cas says something along the line of how incredibly violent Poppy is and how it turns him on.– we'd be all dead by the end of this book. 🙃✯¸.•´*¨`*•✿ ✿•*`¨*`•.¸✯Update: I'm obsessed with the Blood and Ash fanart and need to share another one!Credit: Clever CrowA Kingdom of Flesh and Fire is the sequel in the From Blood and Ash series and starts right where the first book left off. It will answers some of the questions, but to no one's surprise will also leave you with a lot of questions and theories thanks to the mean cliffhanger. 
Atlantia rose from blood and ash. We are no longer a fallen kindom. Not by any sense of the world. We haven't been for a very long time. We are a kindom of fire.
I was kind of afraid to start this book, because I thought I would be confused. I've read Book 1, From Blood & Ash this year and it should be fresh on my mind, but it's not, cause I've read a lot of other books since then and some details are kinda fuzzy. If you're like me and too lazy/don't have time/or for whatever reason to reread From Blood & Ash, let me assure you: A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire gives a good summary or rather brings up important plotpoints that will remind you of the previous book.  What turned out surprisingly  well was the pacing. While it took me a while to get into the first book due to all the world building, A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire was better paced from the beginning til the end. It had a good balance of actions, fight scenes, dialogue, world building etc. Not to say that there weren't parts that were dragging, but it was way easier to get into the story. 
Feelings were not stagnant. Neither were opinions or beliefs, and if we stopped believing people were capable of change, then the world might as well be left to burn.
 I'd love to tell you something about the plot but I'm shit with plot summaries so I'm just going to ramble about the characters and the romance, cause let's be honest that's what I'm most interested in.   ↳ ✧ 
Penellaphe 'Poppy' Balfour
 ✧ Poppy is a badass character, but then all females in fantasy series seem to be super badass. It's nothing special and it's not like it hasn't been done before. It's sounds very negative, but I don't mean it in a bad way. It is what it is and that's okay. Despite that trope being overused I still love Poppy so much. Poppy is the girl that has been hidden from the world since her birth, groomed by the society and the queen she lived in to behave, be quiet and do what she's told. AKOFAF is the continuance of her character development into the real Poppy. The character development was so good. In this book Poppy learns a lot more about her powers that are evolving and her role in all of it. Let's not start about her abilities with a knife, sword or bow. We stan a  ✧ queen ✧ or should I say ✧ princess ✧  who can cut up her enemies like a fine steak. 🔪 
“I bet you’re one of those wolven bitches. Hear they like their women all cut up.” He made a calling sound, one used to summon a dog, and my grip tightened. “Tell me, girl. What kind of bitch are you?” He lifted the club again, and I made my move. Shooting forward, I slipped under his arm and grabbed the dirty tunic. Thrusting the dagger up, I used every ounce of strength I had to drive it deep under his chin. “I’m this kind of bitch,” I growled. The muscles under the mask pieced together by human flesh went lax as I jerked the knife free.
It will be interesting to see how Poppy is going to deal with what happened at the end.   ↳ ✧ 
Casteel 'Hawke'thorne Da'Neer
 ✧I love you and I will love you until the end of time.  Casteel also known as Hawke in From Blood and Ash, but I'm going to just call him Cas because I like that name better lol. Cas has built a name for himself as the 'Dark One' but honestly the only dark thing about him is his hair. Otherwise he is ✧ babyyy ✧ He is a tortured soul that is still dealing with his past. Cas is putting on his charm infront of his people and trying to so hard to be enough without knowing that he is enough. Everything he does, he does it fiercely. The prince of Atlantia does not play when it comes to Poppy. The things he says to her I don't know but it just wants to make me cry. Cas has some swoonworthy things to say i'm telling y'all!! 
"I need to feel your lips on mine." He planted his hands on the carriage wall, caging me in. "I need to feel your breath in my lungs. I need to feel your life inside me. I just need you. It's an ache. This need. Can I have you? All of you? 
While Cas background was very wishy-washy in the previous book for a reason, I enjoyed learning more about his past and his family in AKOFAF. I was soaking all the information about what shaped him into the man he is now like sponge in heat. It's giving his character more dimension with rough edges, cause he's more than just a pretty face.  ↳ ✧ 
Kieran I-forgot-his-last-name
 ✧Jennifer L. Armentrout has the talent to write the best secondary characters. Kieran is no exception. JLA uses the same formula for all of her side characters: sprinkles a bit of sarcasm here, a little arrogance there, insert a definition of loyal and supportive friend and BOOM you'll have JLA side characters. BUT 👏. IT 👏. WORKS 👏. EVERY 👏. TIME 👏.  Having said that, I looooved what Kieran brought to the story. Kieran and Cas bromance is one of my favorite things in this book. Their bond is so strong and only death can pull them apart. His brother from another mother. Also Poppy and Kieran's growing friendship was hilarious. They reminded me of two siblings who annoy each other daily but also care about them a lot. Honestly their interactions with each other is sooo funny!!  
"He is not wounded," Kieran answered. "At least, not physically. Emotinoally, I believe you left him shredded."I rolled my eyes. "Then why ask if he's okay if he's not hurt?" Kieran started to reply, but Casteel beat him to it. "He's a worrywart. Constantly fearing that I've been injured or that I've overexerted myself. Wanting to know if I've gotten eight hours of rest and eaten three square meals a day.""Yeah, that's exactly it," Kieran replied drolly.

I reacted without thought, slamming my elbow into his stomach. Casteel grunted out a curse. “Please don’t fight atop the horse,” Delano called out from somewhere behind us. “None of us wish to watch Setti trample either of you.”“Speak for yourself,” came Kieran’s droll voice. Casteel straightened behind me. “Don’t worry. Neither of us will fall. It was just a love tap.”“That did not look like a love tap,” Naill commented. “That’s because it was a very passionate one,” Casteel replied. “You’re about to get a love tap to your face,” I muttered under my breath. Casteel curled his arm more firmly around my waist as he laughed. 
If something happens to Kieran in the next two books, I'm ready to hail fire on y'all.  ↳ ✧ 
The romance
 ✧
"No." His forehead dropped to mine. "There is one mor thing I need. Something that I've needed for days. Weeks. Months. Maybe forever." The bridge of his nose brushed mine. "But I know you won't allow it. Not like this."The pounding in my chest moved lower. "What…what have you needed for so long?""You."
 Oh my goooddd. THE ANGST guys the angst!! Fake dating or in this case fake engagement is always bringing a certain level of angst with it and I was here for it. Poppy and Cas having to fake that they are in love infront of everyone is doing things to my heart. The uncertainty for the characters if what was said/done is pretend or real? All the kisses, touches, stares… Give me all the longing!! That really tugged on my heartstrings.   Poppy and Cas relationship ended on a rocky note in the first book, in this book Poppy starting to learn again that maybe not everything was a lie. Their dynamic is interesting… Poppy's love for sharp objects and Cas' kink to be turned on by it. That's some entertainment right there. While their banter greatly entertained me, sometimes Poppy's stabbing tendencies were repetitively mentioned. It was maybe a bit too much.  But, the honesty between and Casteel and Poppy is a sight to behold. I mean after a betrayal the only way from there is up. The truth is out. The cards are open. Communication is key and Poppy and Cas do that. Whenever Poppy asked a question no matter how hard hitting it is, Casteel answered her honestly. 
"Always," he whispered in the breath we shared. "Your heart was always safe with me. It always will be. There is nothing I will protect more fiercely or with more devotion, Poppy. Trust in that–in what you feel from me. In me."
These two are so cute together.. So many heart eyes!! 😍😍😍 Casteel and Poppy are slowly making their way into my top JLA couples. #1 is always going to stay Daemon Black and Katy Swartz, because they're ✧ royalty ✧ and no one can change my mind.  Anyway, i'm excited for what next to come. Hoping for a spring release with how fast JLA is writing *fingers crossed*
