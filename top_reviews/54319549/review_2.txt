Y'ALL AIN'T READY FOR THE HELL I WENT THROUGH READING HONEYDEW PART 2!!!!!i cringed so hard from reading this that my face broke. THIS WAS 70% TRAVELING AND TALKING AND CRINGING, 15% BITING AND BONING AND HEAVING, AND 5% ACTUAL PLOTâ€” im fucking seeethingggggasdn234asdnaslknf oiqhfoifl!!!!!!!! ISTG, Casteel's whole personality is smelling like dark lush spicy spice, pine, and citrus. Aside from smelling like a fruit, I guess he can only taste fruit honeydew too. This has a higher rating than the first- y'all need to chilllll. (if i pass away it's because this book fucking killed me).1 STAR BECAUSE WHAT THE FUCK. i talked about this shit here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAg98...Twitter | Bookstagram | Youtube |
