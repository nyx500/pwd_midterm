Things I never want to read again: 1. “You intrigue me.”2. Any sentence that involves the word princess. 3. “I’m going to stab you.” 4. “There’s seriously something wrong with you.”5. ANYmore questions from Poppy, who seems to only speak when asking questions and making stab threats. Things I DO want:The damn threesome scene, and it’s the only reason I’ll be reading the third book.
