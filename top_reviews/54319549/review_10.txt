2 starsOkk Judging by all the five star ratings that i’ve been seeing for this book, I’m honestly in the minority here but that’s ok. A lot of things hindered my enjoyment of this book so let me just get into them.🔹  Overall feelings: 〰 Oh my ever loving God who the hell allowed this book to be this long for no freaking reason? I liked some aspects of it but if you’re going to go into this book please know that this is, in every sense of the word, a  filler   book... and it  shows. 🔹  The pacing: 〰 Here’s the thing, a slow paced book doesn’t normally bother me that much and usually, if the plot is action packed, then I find that I actually prefer slower paced books as they help me have enough time to understand everything that’s happening. However, not only does nothing interesting or of import actually happen in this book, but the author shows you every single second of every single  hour  of every single  day  and I just couldn’t help but wonder...  why???? 🔹  The plot : 〰 Who? What? Where?When I tell you nothing of import actually happens... I mean it. Since we see every single second of the day, the whole book takes place over the span of what? A week? Maybe two? Mostly they’re on the road and trying to get to Atlantia but they literally only get to the city in the last 10 pages... which is why the only interesting event to happen in this entire book happens in the last 10 pages. And for a 600+ book, I don’t think that’s normal. Had this book been 300 pages shorter, i would have loved it. Hell, had it been 600 pages long but with real dialogue or at least a real plot, I also would have liked it. The entire plot of this book is:- Someone gets hurt, - Poppy heals them, - Everybody in town sees what she’s doing, - People are either afraid of her or in awe, - Someone tells her that she’s amazing, - Poppy blushes and says that’s she’s not. I kid you not, that’s the entire plot... kill me. Kill me now. But the repetitiveness of the plot leads me to my next point...🔹  The dialogue : Remember when I said that this book needed to be 300 pages shorter? Yeah, that could have easily happened if the repetitiveness in the dialogue had been dealt with and cut out. I kid you not, when I tell you that you absolutely have to hear about how ‘random’ Poppy’s questions are and how ‘intriguing’ Casteel finds her every.single.chapter. And it’s not like they use different words to describe these things. Oh no, they literally use the words “random” and “intriguing” every time which just made me want to...  *combust*. That’s not the only repetitive thing however. Every single time Poppy meets someone new, they have a discussion about how “violent” she is and how she stabbed Hawke when he betrayed her. This conversation legit happens every couple of chapters and at one point, it’s just like... I get it. I was actually there when it happened so I don’t need to reread the events over and over again. I get that she’s not  like other girls , I promise- (thankfully, no one actually uses this phrase in the book so thank God for small mercies I guess). 🔹  The characters: 〰   Hawke: I still liked him in this installment but some of the things he did just annoyed the living crap out of me. For one, we get that you like Poppy when she’s threatening you. I promise you that we get it. Secondly, the whole miscommunication and not telling your partner how you feel for so long just annoyed me. Finally, that scene at the end with the battle against the duchess and her army... the fact that he and Poppy legit stopped in the middle of the battle to kiss and have a whole ass conversation about how they need to get out (which, don’t even get me started about how he would have left his people to get massacred just to be able to get his wife out) just made me irritated with them... again. Also, are you kidding me with the scene in the duchess’s carriage?!? They’re literally STILL ON THE BATTLEFIELD  in the middle of THE FREAKING BATTLE . But oh well, to each their own I guess *shrugs*. 〰   Poppy: Biggest disappointment in this entire book for me. If you’ve read my review for the first book (which I loved) then you’ll remember that I absolutely ADORED Poppy and that I found her to be one the best female characters that I’ve read in a while because I thought that she was soo well balanced (I explain what I mean by that in my review of the first book). In this book however, it felt like Poppy went from being a three dimensional, well developed character to being someone with one personality trait... which was that she’s violent. Literally. Her threatening to stab or kill someone got old pretty fast and just made me wish that she would show the different facets of her personality just like she did in the first book. That didn’t happen however which left me feeling incredibly disappointed in her character arc. 〰   Side characters : I liked all of them. I don’t like Alistir but that’s ok since I think that the author actually wants us to be weary of him. Kieran i liked but the whole thing with him and the joining just made me uncomfortable. I would much rather him be an older brother figure to Poppy than anything else to be honest. 🔹  Final thoughts: 〰 I think that this book would have been much much better had we had the chance to see them in Atlantia (the part where Casteel’s parents live). I would have loved to see both main characters deal with the king and queen in this book instead of prolonging the inevitable meeting for so long. Most of this book takes place on the road and that just did not do it for me. Although I enjoyed some aspects of this installment, I think that this is a filler book in every sense of the word. I was also really disappointed when I learned that this was going to be a series instead of a trilogy because that’s usually how and why filler books are created... to prolong the journey for no damn reason instead of just getting to the point. That said, some things did amuse me and I did like some scenes so I do recommend reading this book if you enjoyed the first one. And since I seem to be in the minority here, then chances are you’re probably going to be enjoying this much more than I did!Happy reading.——————— Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rose_books2/
