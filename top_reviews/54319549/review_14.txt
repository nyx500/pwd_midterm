Are yall ready for a rant review? Because I have a lot to say. I have been planning this review pretty much the entire time I’ve been reading this book, it’s the only thing that kept me sane. I... I don’t even know where to start in terms of AKOFAF. AKOFAF. Hmm. That sounds a little familiar. Where have I heard it before? Oh, right. ACOMAF. Those sound suspiciously similar, and if I’m being 100% honest, this is kind of (very much) an ACOTAR rip off. I mean, yeah, the plot and shit isn’t the same, but some scenes and certain dialogue and things like heartmates you can tell are taken right out of that series. JLA must’ve read it right before writing this book lmao. So that was just Complaint #1. Would you like to hear the others?꧁The Plot꧂Well.... what plot? What plot, exactly, are we talking about here? Cuz I don’t see shit. Unless you mean info dumps and vague world-building and unnecessary sex scenes in the middle of battle and Casteel talking about Poppy being violent and stabbing people and Poppy being ✨curious✨and ✨nOt LiKE oTHeR GiRLs.✨ If you’re talking about that, then yeah, sure, there’s a plot. But other than that? Nope. Nothing happens. Nothing ever fucking happens, except for at the ending, which I’m starting to think is JLA’s way of making sure people continue reading her shitty series. I said what I said. This entire book is pretty much Poppy and Casteel and Kieran s l o w l y making their way to Atlantia. Of course, they only get there at the very end, and in the meantime, all their is is people talking about how ✨speshul✨ Poppy is, random battles, and Poppy and Casteel having Communication Issues™️ AND cringey dialogue. Let’s not forget about the cringey dialogue. I swear, (and I’ll go back and check,) these characters have the exact same conversation multiple times. And they’re not dialogue you want to be hearing many times, either. Believe me when I say it’s cringey as fuck. It all consists of lines like:❥“..... intruiging....“ many times from everyone❥“...so violent and it turns me on...“ from casteel❥“...poppy...stab someone again...“ from everyone❥“there’s something wrong with you.“ from poppy❥“i bet you do.“ from poppyAnd many, many more, though I don’t really care to name them all because it makes me want to gouge my eyes out. And I think you guys get the point. As another reviewer said, this is a filler book, and it shows.꧁The Characters꧂Poppy:So, in my review for the first book, I said that I didn’t find poppy annoying or whiny. Well, now I’m taking that back. She is both of those things. Before I get into the specifics, let’s start basic here. Her name is Penellaphe. Penellaphe. What kind of name is that?! I feel bad for her lmao. So yeah, even her name is bad. Ech. Now, for her personality. Oh, wait. What personality? As far as I can tell, the only personality traits Poppy has are being ✨violent✨, wanting to stab people, being ✨cURiOUs✨ and asking questions. Also being sheltered and not knowing anything about anything. So of course she’s going to ask questions. That’s not a personality trait, that’s not something to be praised for. If you have been sheltered your whole life, of course you are going to have questions about things. That’s just common sense. Casteel and Kieran and everyone else act like Poppy’s so ✨sPEshUL✨ and ✨nOt LiKE OtHER giRLS✨ because she asks questions, and honestly it’s fucking annoying. Back to the girl herself. I’m pretty sure she has the exact same thought process about 109 times in this book. Maybe more. The point is, it gets us absolutely nowhere. At the end of the first book, she admits that she is in love with Casteel. Halfway through this book, she comes to the conclusion that she might care for him beyond sexual attraction. W H A T ? I don’t get it. I don’t understand. Haven’t you come to that conclusion 20 million times before? I’m done, you guys. I’m so done. Casteel:So, I liked him as Hawke in the first book. I got annoyed with him at the end, because he was making me angry and ✨uncomfy✨, but i just assumed that oh, it’s fine, I’ll just fall in love with him over again in the second book. Well, no. Thats not what happened. If anything, Cas gets even more annoying in this book. All he ever thinks about and all he ever talks about is how amazing Poppy is and how whenever she’s violent it turns him on. Thats his entire personality, right there. Also, the author tries to make him so perfect. She tries to make him treat poppy ✨so well✨, believe in all the right things, and yet also be ✨bad✨ and ✨morally grey.✨ Well, i hate to tell you, JLA, but this is not how you write a good morally grey character. She just makes him confusing. Even poppy admits it at one point in the book, that Casteel is unpredictable and we never know how he’s gonna act. Actually, I disagree with that. I can predict how he is going to act, because he acts the exact same way each time we see him. But, each time we see him, the way he acts is confusing. It doesn’t make any sense, I know, but that’s exactly my point. Casteel doesn’t make any sense. Essentially he’s just an always horny, more annoying, cheap copycat version of Rhys from acotar. Yes, I said what I said. Kieran:Yay, I can finally talk about something I actually liked. Someone. I rated this book 1.5 stars, which means there was maybe one thing I liked about the book. Here is that thing. Right here. Kieran. K I E R A N. Yeah, he’s not the most original, and yeah, he’s not the most complex character ever, but he’s the best. He’s just the best, that’s my only explanation. I actually think the main reason for me liking him so much is that he, too, has to put up with Cas and Poppy 24/7. I relate to that. I relate to that a lot. He also just makes every situation better because he’s the only character who’s actually funny, and on occasion he makes fun of the two main characters, which is just the best fucking thing. So yeah. We stan Kieran in this house, and that’s about it.(Yes, there were other characters, but they’re not important enough to mention, so I’m just gong to skip over them and pretend that they don’t exist because I wasn’t paying attention to them anyways.)꧁The romance꧂Cas and Poppy:See, the thing is, I actually liked their romance in the first book. I’ve thought about why I liked it, and I’ve come to the conclusion that it was because of the trust. You cannot have a good, healthy relationship if there is no trust. That was not a problem for the first book. Poppy and Hawke trusted each other just fine. They were cute, they were sweet, there wasn’t really anything wrong with them. And then. And then. Hawke betrayed Poppy and became Casteel, Poppy was angry but still liked him, they had angry sex, blah blah blah. But all that trust that was there before? Gone. The author tries to bring it back in this book, by telling us over and over that Poppy trusts Cas and vice versa, but it just isn’t there. Yeah, they have pretty good sexual tension, and their smut scenes are fine, but other than that? I don’t see much. They can barely even admit that they love each other in their own minds, much less saying it out loud. They’re in constant denial of their feelings, and the whole will-they-won’t-they thing is annoying as fuck. Also, Communication Issues™️. There are so many communication issues it aint even funny. Poppy and Cas can’t tell each other anything. The closest they come to telling each other something along the lines of “I love you” is Cas complimenting Poppy and Poppy blushing and changing the subject. Occasionally there will be some cheesy line from Poppy that doesn’t make much sense, but that’s about it. It’s kinda sad cuz I was rooting for these two in the beginning, but things change ig ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.The Joining:I feel like y’all would want to know how I felt about this, so I gave it it’s own section. It’s gonna be a pretty short section, but still. So. On one hand, I do think the joining is a little weird and I’m not really sure what the purpose of it is.... for what, JLA? What’s the reason? I don’t really understand, it doesn’t seem necessary to the plot or the character development or even the romance, for that matter. But. On the other hand, I’m all for it, and I’m not really sure why Poppy keeps complaining about it. She gets to sleep with two super-hot guys? (Just ignoring the fact that they’re gonna do some cannibalistic shit too.) She’s lucky asf. Also, we need some more Kieran in our lives. Kieran is the best thing ever, so I think that’s the overwhelming reason why I generally would like the joining to happen. Bring it on lmaooo.꧁The writing꧂So it pretty much just tries to be SJM’s writing. Some of the phrases JLA uses are taken right from acomaf, and it’s honestly pretty obvious. The rest of the writing isn’t generally bad; there were some phrases that were good.... but there were most definitely things that were cringey asf, as I’ve said before. Mainly the dialogue, as I’ve also said before. I don’t really want to go over that again though because I don’t want to relive the discomfort lmao. So I don’t really have much else to say, except for that this isn’t a well-written book by a long shot, but I have most definitely read worse. It’s no doubt written better than most Wattpads and fanfics, which I always take as a good sign. That’s about it lmao, I know this is probably the shortest section yet. (What does it say about me that my section on the joining was longer than my section on the writing. 💀) ꧁Wrap-up꧂Okkkk, so that’s pretty much it for my review, I hope y’all enjoyed. Rant reviews are so much fun lmao. Bye now, thanks for reading if you made it all the way to the end that’s impressive asf, now go and read the book that you know you should be reading rn but aren’t. (Ik cuz I do that too ehehe.)
