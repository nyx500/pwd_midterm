A very enjoyable read by Sullivan about how Royce and Hadrian met. While the first half was just ok, probably because it follows Royce, Hadrian, and Gwen separately, it definitely gears up from the moment Royce and Hadrian meet for the first time. Their relationship's dynamics is one of the best out there, the synergistic effect at its best.A very fun and quick read about this hilarious team that we all love. Superbly narrated by Tim Gerard Reynolds.3.75/5 for the first half, 4.25/5 for the second half.4/5
