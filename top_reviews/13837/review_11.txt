Yep, I just re-read all of these books for the first time since I was 12. Damn you, Kindle!I enjoyed them the second time around-- not as much as I did when I was 12 and feisty and just beginning to understand that being a teenager meant wanting to fight EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME. Alanna was a pretty great outlet for that.Things I liked that I missed the first time around:-Sex positivism. For real!-Awesome and strong female characters consistently passing the Bechdel Test.-Awesome male characters.-Descriptions of getting stronger and developing callouses. I work out more than I did back then, and I love the feelings Pierce describes.Things I didn't like as much the second time around:-The writing was a bit less engaging than I remember, but it's still awesome. There are a few too many "the amethyst-eyed girl looked at the blue-eyed boy" things, and several abrupt perspective changes.-Everybody just seems to be okay with a talking cat. I mean, okay.-Duke Roger wasn't as engaging a villain as I remembered him to be.Things I still liked:-Aw George. -Aw Faithful.-I will always love that Alanna's such a badass.
