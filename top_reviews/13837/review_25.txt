Re-read February 2016Hey, my original review is pretty good. So, you know, what she said. She being me. Okay, wait. Except I am more curious about Alex. So he just needed to be the best and that is his whole character??? I also wish more time had been spent on Thom.Original ReviewI forgot how MUCH happens in this book! Anyway. I liked seeing Alanna among her friends again and realizing how much she (and they) had changed. And the relationship with Liam makes so much sense. For all that she has three love interests, it never feels like TOO many.I kind of wish a little more time had been spent on her and George's relationship in this book? I mean, don't get me wrong, I LOVE their relationship and I love that I can see he really did end up being the right guy for her, the guy she loves, the one who loved all parts of her and whose dreams matched her own, but I felt like a lot of that was maybe too subtle? The very first time I read the books, I was rooting for Jon. After that, I was always glad she didn't end with Jon, but in re-reading this, I think I can see how my younger self didn't quite get the George thing. Alanna's feelings aren't examined too closely--I can see her change her mind about marriage, but it's not clear she's specifically thinking about George--and George isn't as open about his feelings.Of course, maybe if there'd been more focus on it, it would've been TOO much and I wouldn't have liked the relationship as well as I now do.
