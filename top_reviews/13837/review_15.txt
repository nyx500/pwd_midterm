4.5 starsI love how this book brought things full circle, going back to the first installment. Coram and Myles are the best male characters in this series (followed up by Gary and Raoul, only because they get less page time). Jon and George are entirely too presumptuous throughout (even though I do love the final pairing), and Liam is just... messy. Alanna herself remains a mercurial, sometimes maddeningly indecisive protagonist, and I like that she has such a myriad of flaws. Hmm? That? Don't mind me, I'm still sobbing over Faithful.And now I need to go see if anyone has written a George-Alanna-Thayet-Jon polycule fanfic. And maybe a Delia/Josiane pairing.
