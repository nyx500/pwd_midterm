After adoring the first, liking the second and hating the third, the fourth came somewhere in-between. The first half of this book was a bit of struggle for me, but honestly once the adventure for the jewel was over, the story picks up a bit.I didn't like how Alanna's brother Thom was practically non-existent throughout the entire series, and has a small (or rather large) part in this book and. . . no, just no. The author made it seem like just because they were twins, they knew everything about each other and were each other's other half, but really they had only sent a few letters to each other throughout their lives and never even visited each other. The end of the book just didn't touch me like I suppose the author meant. This is a story that can be stopped at the first book if you'd like to skip all the frustration, rambling and whining and just imagine the rest. For honestly, not much happens in the last three books worth mentioning. Oh and also, this would have had only 1 star, but I liked who she wound up with, and he was the only character I've loved whole-heartedly the entire time.
