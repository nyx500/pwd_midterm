I like the characters, I do. They change and develope. I also like how Flewelling will revisit things, too, like the death of Alec's father. Things aren't just swept under the rug and I appreciate that.I also appreciate how Seregil and Alec's relationship isn't the focus of the story that unfortunately happens too much in romance, especially homoerotica. The book is more dedicated to the story and in doing so, makes their relationship realistic and believable.The biggest complaint I have is making the villians, well, too villianous. There's no semblance of humanity in them. They hunt, torture, kill and do little else. I was really hoping that there would be much more depth in her villians because I appreciate The Antagonist and a strong antagonist makes a stronger protagonist. However, these were bad, bad men and their actions seemed over-the-top, like she was trying to convince her reader of how nefarious they truly were. I ached to see instances of weakness, and quiet contemplation. Maybe even a relationship (non-romantic) form between her two leading villians. But unfortunately they struck me as flat, and although terrifying, remained uninteresting.As a small note, Thero is becoming a fantastic character and I'm excited to see more of him in the next book.
