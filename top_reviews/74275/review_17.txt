i lost actual sleep just so i could consume this book at an ungodly speed and i don't regret it one bit tbhstalking darkness takes everything established in the first book and cranks up it to 100. the characters become more developed, lingering plot threads are revisited or resolved, the world becomes grittier and much darker. the amount of mutual pining between alec and seregil just about killed me. while stalking darkness is well-paced and interesting throughout, the last 30%ish was soooo intense i just couldn't put it down and it's what made me have to give it a 5 star rating. the use of different pov's was excellent, and i really liked how flewelling used this as a clever way to reveal a few things, but keep us in the dark about others. i think it's hard to pull that off in a way that works, and i feel how it all ended up coming together was extremely satisfying!the ending was totally not what i thought was going to happen whatsoever and while i want to devour the next book asap, i think i need to take a tiny break for my own insanity. but if the other 5 installments are going to be anything like this, i dont see myself taking a long time in finishing this series at all!
