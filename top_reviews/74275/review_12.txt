Struggling to finish now that I've read past the magic rape scene. Nary a word is being said in the aftermath, except that our MC feels dirty. Okay, so what now? Is anybody else going to address it? Or is it okay because he did't say no, and he's male, and the woman was hot? Oh wait, he did say no, then yes, then "I don't know." That's when your partner should stop. Stoppity stop. And if you don't stop, someone should hit you in the face with a brick until you do. Friends don't let friends get magicked into sexual scenarios against their will. Especially when said friends are 16 year old virgins with dead parents. Hello.
