4.5 starsFirst, there were far less typos in this one than the previous one, and some of these errors are consistent, so they clearly made a choice that I just don't agree with, like choosing to put a space between " and ' when a character is quoting someone or something else. "'So and so said...'" should be how those are noted, not " 'So and so said...' " If I take those and other stylistic choices out, there are still more typos than I'd expect from a major publisher, but not enough to earn my "needs editing" shelf. Just barely though. But onto the important things. I somehow forgot how much I adore Alec and Seregil, not to mention Nysander, Beka, Kari, Klia, and everyone else. Yes, even Thero, who makes some great strides here, though they were painful and cost him dearly. I don't remember if we learn why he made the choices he made in later books, so I'll stay mum on any theories for now so the first timers in my BR group can feel free to theorize. üòÅThis book was painful for all our characters, Alec and Seregil especially. There's a point where the plot just tips over the incline and it's a rollercoaster ride from there to the end, and it's very hard to put down. But before that, we got to enjoy some laughs and good natured teasing at our clueless leads who can't figure out how they feel about certain things. It's very well done and realistic.Flewelling doesn't pull any punches here, and this is a great conclusion to the larger events that were set up in book 1. Also, since there was less worldbuilding that needed to be done, the story flowed much more naturally and easily, without having to stop every so often to explain things to Alec/the reader. Thanks for the fun BR, Rosa, Elena, Teal, and Moony!
