I was reading this book for so long (I think on and off for 9 months), so it's been one of those books that has been lingering on my 'currently reading' shelf for an enormous amount of time. That's really on me though because I did/do really enjoy these characters. After finishing the first book, I was eager to find out what Alec, Seregil, Micum, and Nysander would get mixed up with next, and I was not disappointed. A lot happens in the installment, and it all leads to this big climactic ending. I really enjoy following these characters, and I get all fuzzy inside when they show how much love they have for each other. I'm a sucker for found families, and these characters are definitely that. In this book, we get a lot of perspective from Beka (sp?), Micum's eldest daughter. She's now a part of a war regiment, so we get to see some skirmishes between Skala and their enemies. I will say that I wasn't as interested in these chapters just because she's there on her own. Her comrades are fine, but I didn't bother remembering their names because they might die and I didn't find them all that important. If Beka had had some more emotional ties or engaging interactions with those around her, I may have found her parts more interesting.There is also a rape that happens toward the beginning of the book, and it's not really addressed. Our main lad, Alec, get's sexually assaulted by a woman. The other characters are annoyed, but they don't actually hold the rapist accountable which was really odd, especially odd for Seregil. This book is slow-paced for the most part which probably contributed to why it took me so long to finish. I think if the ending wasn't so exciting and rewarding, I probably would have rated this a little lower, but as it is, the ending really saved this one for me. I actually am really looking forward to the next installment because I think it will be a whole different playing field after this book.
