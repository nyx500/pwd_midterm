This series is so underrated, more people need read 'cause it's so good. Some people have problem with the plotting stuff in the first book but it didn't really bothered me so I think it's great. But this one is so much better than the first one(plot-wise,pacing). Seregil and Alec are such great characters and don't forget about Micum, I think he deserves more love. Another one is Beka, she's such a badass I love it. It's really rare to see characters like her especially when it was first published.To be honest I thought the stuff that happened in this book would happen in the third one 'cause it feel like the final boss fight. So I'm really curious to see what happens in the next book.I didn't really care for the whole sacrifice thing but the ending scene made me cry (Ｔ▽Ｔ). I'm really excited to see were their adventures takes them next.
