I still don't like the narrator voice. Alec continues to sound weird, and sometimes he made the wrong voice to the wrong character which is confusing and annoying.  Nysander death was a hard one to listen to  But this series is one of my all times favourite, this brought back to me the joy of reading after a hard time, so I refuse to give it less than 5 stars. Bear with me.
