The wheel of fortune started to move in the first book and now war is starting to take its toll in people and country. In this uncertain environment our heroes are involved in something that could destroy the world they know. In this book you see how Alec grows and matures without Seregil protection and how Seregil despite himself, has to accept an unwanted fate. Flewelling has here a very good narration pace. The book starts more or less where we stop in the first one and at first you think this is another Skalan intrigue, but as you move towards the end the things start to complicate more and more. She shows us the narration from the point of view of different characters and you'll dread to turn the pages because you don't know what is going to happen next.
