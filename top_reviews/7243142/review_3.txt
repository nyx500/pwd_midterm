I hate saying goodbye especially to the series that I have come to love so much. I can't get the world of Fablehaven out of my head and heart. I feel like life's not going to be the same without this series. Yep I'm being emotional but it's true. Kendra and Seth Sorensen, brother and sister duo whom I didn't like at all in the first book have grown on me a lot especially Seth. Seth kept me completely hooked and entertained. We are introduced with Bracken in this book. Although he's great as he's a unicorn and Fairy Queen's only son, he's no Gavin. This is one part where I felt like that Brandon Mull manipulated with my emotions where he gives Kendra what she's always been fascinated with (Kendra loves unicorns and she didn't even know if they truly existed) because Gavin died in the last book. Oh boy! I totally saw it coming with Graulas. I still don't know how I feel about how the tables turned and The Sphinx ended up helping them. I mean none of it would have happened if The Sphinx hadn't started all that in the first place. I also wish there was more role of The Eternals. Because the whole thing felt rushed to tie all the loose ends. Also about Seth not being able to use the sword but Kendra gets to use it made me mad. I felt so bad for Seth that he goes through all this only not to be able to use the sword. And Kendra gets everything in the end. Yes Bracken felt like another piece to tie the loose end. I didn't really like the idea of Bracken and Kendra ending up together.Again I wanted more of Vanessa and I loved how Warren and Vanessa end up together. Doren and Newel always put a smile on my face. So do Hugo and Mendigo. Rex was pretty amazing too. Minus few things, I really liked the book and can't wait to read the spin-off.4.5 stars
