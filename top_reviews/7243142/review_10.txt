This is a long book, and it’s jam-packed. It’s like four books in one. This is the thrilling conclusion to the Fablehaven series (at least until Dragonwatch). I had forgotten a lot of this book!Seth and Kendra are on separate adventures for most of the book. There are new and old characters, some surprises, and a respectable body count. It’s all very exciting, and as always Mull’s imagination is enviable. Definitely read the previous books first.I’m not crazy about the narrator. He sounds like he’s reading to a bunch of 5-year-olds. I guess it’s fine for young kids, but for anyone else it’s kind of slow and patronizing.
