I started this book a few evenings after it came out and told myself I would put it down and go to bed as soon as I reached a stopping point. I finished the book seven hours later, having read the entire thing straight through, because as it turned out, there are no stopping points. The book sucks you in from the first chapter and doesn't let you go until it's done.The story follows Kendra, Seth and their friends all over the world, from the Middle East to the American deep south to Scotland to the Canadian wilderness. There they encounter Mull's usual array of original magical beings and familiar mythical creatures with the author's unique twist. Kendra and Seth both grow immensely in this book, with Kendra learning that sometimes you have to take action and Seth learning that sometimes you have to think. Reading the last battle scene, it's really incredible to see how far they've come, when you think of how in the first book, Kendra was shy and scared and Seth was pretty much an idiot.And the book is surprisingly profound in places, commenting, without preaching, about the nature of good and evil and temptation and choices. A great read and an excellent end to an excellent series.
