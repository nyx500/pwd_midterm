Very exciting. I liked meeting new people and traveling to another preserve. The dragons were amazing. And whether or not it was intentional, Raxtus made me laugh. It's interesting to see Kendra's relationship with the Fairy Queen develop. I'm glad Seth's character is growing up; he's a lot like Warren now. Unfortunately, Warren has the worst luck of anyone.
