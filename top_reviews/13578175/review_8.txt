My only complaint about this book is that it should have been longer!Shai is a forger, meaning that she can rewrite an object's history, thus making it into a new object. Such magic is considered taboo within the Empire, that is until they find themselves enlisting Shai's help to try and forge the soul of their fallen Emperor, Ashravan. I don't know why I loved this so much, I think I was just completely entranced by the magic system. It depends wholly on the plausibility of any given thing to be another thing, it's a mystical power that's rooted in an object's potential, and that is so cool to me. Even though this book was only 175 pages, I was able to get such a clear sense of the characters. They were so genuinely written, like I could absolutely go out into the world and find similar people. When a character feels real, their motivations become important to me as a reader. I love the process of feeling an author breathe life into their words. I'll say that if you're reading this and hoping there will be throwbacks to Elantris, don't. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but there isn't really much that ties this book to Teod or Arelon or Elantris or any of the countries/cities previously mentioned. The Jindoese people pop up briefly but that is mostly it. Anyhow, another wonderful installment from Brandon Sanderson!
