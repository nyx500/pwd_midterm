4.0 StarsThis was an engrossing story that will almost certainly please any Sanderson fan. The magic system was well designed and absolutely fascinating to learn about. I loved the themes and discussions surrounding forgery and authenticity. The novella length fit the size of this story. While this was technically set in the Elantris world, it was completely self-contained and could be read first without spoiling the novel.This is easily one of my favourite stories by Sanderson and would be an excellent jumping off point for someone wanting to experience his work.Disclaimer I received a copy of this book from the publisher.
