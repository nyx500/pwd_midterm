This is storytelling.I can count with one finger the number of novellas I have felt compelled to own, and in hardcover nonetheless, and The Emperor’s Soul is that book.
“It would be the greatest Forgery of all”
I will abstain from describing anything regarding the plot as I would love for new readers to experience it without any knowledge, in fact, if you can avoid the blurb, even better. Capturing everything I love about fantasy in the diminutive form of a novella shorter than 130 pages, it is a masterpiece of fiction that I have read no less than five times and will continue to reread many times over.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

The painting grew like something alive, leaves springing from branches, bunches of fruit exploding in succulent bursts. Thicker and thicker the pattern grew, golden trim breaking out of nothing and running like streams, rimming leaves, reflecting light.The mural deepened, every inch imbued with an illusion of movement. Curling vines, unexpected thorns peeking from behind branches. Gaotona breathed out in awe and stepped up beside Shai.
