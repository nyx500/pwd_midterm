The Emperor's Soul by Brandon SandersonComplex, unique, and interesting. Sanderson formed a very interesting and unique world which was surprisingly complex for its length with various related threads of ethical issues, political maneuvering, diverse character motivations, and engaging character interactions. Fast-paced. Excellent world-building. Well developed, and enjoyable characters. And the most interesting part was that there was tension building as the plot revealed. The ending was very, very satisfying, and logical.
No matter how good you were, someone was better. Live by that knowledge, and you would never grow so confident that you became sloppy.
Enjoyable.
