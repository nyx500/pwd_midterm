I loved everything that I've read so far by Sanderson; The Stormlight Archive, Warbreaker, Elantris and Mistborn (Cosmere is a vast place with amazing stories). So I knew I won't be disappointed here as well. Which I was not indeed. But, WHY was this so short? It was Such a unique story, and I would have loved to hear more about Shai and Gaotana and the emperor. Where does Sanderson get these ideas? :) (He actually explains in the postscript if you're interested). One of my favorite quotes was this one. It shows that you can't really see when something goes wrong/right in life, as it's more of a fluid process than we assume;
There was rarely an obvious branching point in a person’s life. People changed slowly, over time. You didn’t take one step, then find yourself in a completely new location. You first took a little step off a path to avoid some rocks. For a while, you walked alongside the path, but then you wandered out a little way to step on softer soil. Then you stopped paying attention as you drifted farther and farther away. Finally, you found yourself in the wrong city, wondering why the signs on the roadway hadn’t led you better.
