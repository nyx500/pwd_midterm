Each person was a puzzle.
My first official read of 2018, read this first cause I know I'll love it and I wanted to start the year with something I'll love.This book is perfect, am still marveled by the fact that its even a novella, the way the plot unravels, and that ending, I did not see that coming, then again its Brandon Sanderson, I shouldn't be surprise, he is a genius. World building and WritingOnce again Brandon Sanderson wowed me, the world is so well depicted even though its a novella of just a few pages. I love the magic system in this book so much, its a but similar to soulcasting. But with this, runes or symbols are carved on stones then stamped on the object to be changed, or on someone to change personality, past, get abilities and the like. The writing is explicit and easy to understand, the book is written in third person multiple POV, but 80% is in Shai’s POV.CharactersShai is just the perfect female protagonist, she is smart, intelligent, confident, manipulative and also a forger. 
what we have before us is a master trickster, liar, and thief. Your best guards would eventually become clay in her hands.”“Thank you,” Shai said.“It was not a compliment.
Despite her career of choice, she is also kind and a great artist that makes people wonder why she forgers instead of making her own art.Gaotona was a mystery for 80% of the book, I had no idea what side he is but am glad for what I found out.I also like Ashravan the emperor, Frava and Uru got exactly what they deserve.
