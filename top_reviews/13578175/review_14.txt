This little book is Brandon Sanderson's true masterpiece.
She was nearly there with this project. The emperor’s soul spread out before her, with only some few corners still shadowed. She wanted to see it through; she longed to find out if she could make him live again.
Shai is a Forger, an artist who can copy and recreate almost anything through the use of forbidden magic. Sentenced to death for the theft of a sacred imperial relic, she grasps her final chance to live, and to perform the greatest feat of Forgery imaginable.Whil Shai is an interesting protagonist, the true star of the show is found in the character of Arbiter Gaotona, an old, powerful man in the upper echelons of imperial society. While his colleagues are merely grabbing for retained power, the soul of Gaotona, the oldest of them, is much deeper than that.I very much enjoyed the relations to artistry and the creative process throughout the book, even as part of a suspenseful story. There is even discussion of ethics and belonging in terms of art. And once more, Brandon Sanderson has proved himself adept at creating interesting mechanisms of the supernatural.Finally, it is also a story about memory. And about identity. About how the two are so irrevocably intertwined in a person’s mind and soul. This is true both for the protagonist and her subjects. And, perhaps, for all of us.
