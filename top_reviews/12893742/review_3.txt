Great conclusion to my favorite Riordan series which is saying a lot over the Percy Jackson, Apollo, and Magnus chase series. The Kane Chronicles finishes with a fight between order, the kane's/Egyptian gods and apophis egypt's chaos snake. This added a lot of depth to the story. The Kane have fully taken over Brooklyn house with young students learning the magic of the gods. Both Sadie and Carter are caught in strange love stories that are advanced for high school literature. The Kanes have to get on the same page with the gods. Bring back Dwarf god bes and defeat apophis. Then they can settle their love life with Zia and Walt. This series is a fun, exciting, and fast paced read. From one of my favorites Rick Riordan. I still think Riordan outlandishly funny.
