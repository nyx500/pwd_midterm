Reread 2023: Liked it a lot better this time. Sadie is a riot.---------More like 2.5 stars. Good, but not great. I was underwhelmed by the ending and thus don't really have much to say.I will comment on the final relationship between Sadie, Walt, and Anubis. Sadie being torn between the two was a pretty big conflict since the last book, but her just taking BOTH felt like no resolution at all. Does it count as polyandry if Walt/Anubis are more like 1.5 people than 2 people?
