The Serpent's Shadow is the third, and final, installment of The Kane Chronicles. It was an interesting and fast paced series to randomly dive into. Yes, I mean randomly because I totally forgot that I added these books to my TBR but one day I just came across the first book and decided it was time to dive into it.From there, meeting Carter and Sadie was a tornado on fire kind of experience. The adventures they went on sort of kept me on my toes but left me endless unanswered questions. Each book was, again, fast paced in my eyes and didn't shy away from the drama or the action. It also felt like this was great for family bonding since Carter and Sadie basically lived different lives from one another. The relationships struggles definitely made me laugh because of how awkward they were. Sadie with boys was probably way more awkward than Carter with girls but it all just made me laugh because it just felt realistic to me. In the end, I'm (sort of) glad that I got to dive into these. I'll definitely have to check out the next series by Rick Riordan - which I think is Magnus Chase? Or Trials of Apollo? Honestly.. I don't even think I finished The Heroes of Olympus.. oops?
