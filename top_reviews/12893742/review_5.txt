A good ending to an alright series. I really liked how things were wrapped up. I was satisfied with all the character arcs, they all felt right. I love Sadie, she is my favorite. She has grown so much and she has learned so much along the way. She is a very impressive character. I was a little confused by Walt's story line, I wish he would have communicated to Sadie his plan to live. But no, he just decided to become one with Anubis and not tell Sadie. I liked Carter a lot more in this book. I think he's going to be a great leader, he already is. I loved seeing Zia get slowly more comfortable with Carter. It was very sweet. I liked how everything was wrapped up, it felt very right if that makes any sense.
