“people are going to form opinions and say nasty things about you based on nothing more than what you are.” alright, so… everyone and their mother on booktube had read this and absolutely adored it, so the stakes were a bit high i guess. and i am happy to report that literally all of them were so right and i loved this story more than i thought was possible.i do not read middle grade often at all, but this made me think that i should get into it more!! it was such a fun read and despite being 400+ pages, it was super quick to get through as well. that also might have something to do with this book being a full package deal: the pacing was great in the entirety of the story, so you never felt bored at all. the writing was truly amazing and the characters were so much fun to read about.the plot constantly took me by surprise because, before picking this up, i didn’t really know what it was about at all. the only information i had beforehand was that amari was looking for her brother, but this story ended up being so much more for me personally! it’s a story about finding you own place and doing what you believe in despite the hardships along the way. i genuinely can’t wait to follow along amari’s side in upcoming stories! definitely one of my favorites of this year already!
