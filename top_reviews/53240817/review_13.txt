I'm still reeling from this book. The twists, yall! Amari and the Night Brothers takes you on a journey from start to finish. She's such a relatable hero and this gives a twist on the chosen one trope in that she's the only one with her special powers but her peers aren't receptive. This book had great world building. Sometimes in MG fantasy authors feel like they have to tell you more than show you the world. And they feel like they have to overexplain to the audience because they are younger. This doesn't do that. The Bureau felt like a real place and readers feel like they're going through this camp and discovering these supernatural beings alongside Amari. While at this camp she's also dealing with being an outsider because she doesn't come from one of the rich legacy families and has different abilities. And I liked how this book never shied away from or tried to condemn her background and change her into someone else.I always look forward to friendships in MG fantasy and the friendships here were well written and fully realized. Amari and her roommate Elise bond over being outcasts and and work together to uncover the secrets behind Quinton's disappearance. See full reviewhttps://womenofcolorreadtoo.blogspot....
