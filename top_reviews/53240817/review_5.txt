This is a Middle Grade Fantasy, and this is the first book in the Supernatural Investigations series. This is the Middle Grade Monthly book for this March 2021, and I saw so many Book Tubes talking about this book. I just had to read this book, and I am so happy I did. This book give me, Men In Black vibes. I loved this book so much, and it was a cool and fun read. There was a big twist that I really did not see coming. I loved the characters in this book, and Amari was so much fun following. I also think the message in this book is so great for kids. The magic in this book was fun and easy to picture which is what I want for a middle grade book. This book was well written, and the pacing was perfect. I cannot wait for the second book in this series. I got the kindle edition of this book from my local library, but I have since ordered a copy of this book for my daughter.
