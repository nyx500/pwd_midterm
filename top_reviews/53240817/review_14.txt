This book is the epitome of why I still read middle grade as an adult. I couldn't put this down and in all honesty, I can't see any other middle grade surpassing this as my favourite middle grade of 2021. There isn't a single thing I didn't like about this book. I had no idea what the book was about before diving in, and really just picked it up because of the hype, but I'm so glad I went in blind. It was so much fun, so wholesome, and so incredibly empowering at the same time. The writing is also fantastic - I had no idea this was BB Alston's debut because this reads like a seasoned author's work.Amari is easily one of my new favourite characters, not just in middle grade fiction, but in general. She's just so incredibly resilient, smart, and kind, and I was ready to fight anyone that dared hurt her in any way, shape, or form. On top of this, the friendship and sibling dynamics in this book were top notch. The pacing in this book is also standout for me - Alston is really good at keeping you interested with a fast-paced plot, while not overwhelming you with what's happening. Some of the twists towards the end definitely caught me by surprise, and I loved it. I have no doubt in my mind that this book and series will become one of the all time greats, in terms of middle grade. It's truly middle grade fantasy at its finest, and I think this is a book that a lot of young girls, especially Black girls, will be able to see themselves in, and that just makes my heart so happy. If it wasn't clear already, 10/10 would recommend this book, regardless of age.
