My biggest take away is that BB Alston has a true talent for writing hateable 12 year olds - the number of middle schoolers I hated in this book is genuinely impressive ðŸ˜¹. All around, this was so charming and I really enjoyed how the book used its fantasy elements to explore classism and elitism. I think pacing this felt a little herky jerky (to be expected in a debut), but overall, loved the characters, world, & themes, and I'm looking forward to the next entry!
