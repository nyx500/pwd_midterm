I cannot believe itâ€™s over. I am still stunned by all the information we were given, all the revelations...It is so much to process.Yet, I revel in every thought and feeling that assaults my body, and trust me, there are many. Absolutely Astonishing! Breathtaking.Mind bending.Heart-wrenching.I was right. I was wrong. I was stupefied. I want more. I need more.I must read it again. Slowly. Savoring every bit over and over. My chest hurts, my brain spins, and all I want to do is hug this book and dive right back in. I am ADDICTED and will never get enough!--Orig. post:I'm not sure I can wait any longer. The theories and questions running rampant in my mind are going to drive me insane. However, I just know this book will be amazing...I can feel it in my bones!
