"You’re Mac, he says. “And I’m Jericho.”
 How did fans live so long with book 4 ending like it did and then the wait for this book? The prior book had a brutal cliffhanger but Karen Marie Moning more than made up for that heart stopping ending with this book. The Sinsar Dubh, everyone wants this damn book! Mac can feel it and can hunt it and so she is very useful to every being who yearns for it. Whether they want to use it for themselves or place it back under lock and key Mac is the girl everyone needs.  Our rainbow girl has grown through this series and totally kicks ass, plays the players and still is stuck.
”The truth was I was standing in the middle of so many lies – some of them hundreds of thousands of years old – that I didn’t know where to begin trying to untangle them.”
Mac finds out all of Barrons secrets and it is about damn time! Mac’s background is revealed and then re-revealed several times during this story. Mac and Barrons finally come clean.
”One of us is going to have to trust the other…”
Barrons was wonderful in this book he shows all he is and in turn they finally are at the stage where readers had wanted them to be since the first book.
”I’m the one who will always watch over you. Always be there to fuck you back to your senses when you need it, the one who will never let you die.” 
Overall, this story is hard to review without ruining any of the twists and turns but I love everyone good or evil in this story!   
”He lives.I breathe.I want. Him. Always.Fire to my ice. Ice to my fever.”
