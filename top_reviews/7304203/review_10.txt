First read: 5 starsSecond read: 5 starsI have been putting off posting this review for the past 4 months. My reasoning: this is without a doubt one of my most favourite fantasy series ever. Which probably makes little sense... but gatekeeping already ancient, popular books is a thing okay😡This is more of a review for the series as a whole, so here's a visual representation of what reading each book felt like:🛑ALL THE SPOILERS ARE HIDDEN IN TAGS🛑📖 Immaculate lyrical writing that sucks you into every page. 📖

“Most people are good and occasionally do something they know is bad. Some people are bad and struggle every day to keep it under control. Others are corrupt to the core and don’t give a damn, as long as they don’t get caught. But evil is a completely different creature, Mac. Evil is bad that believes it’s good.

📖 A layered heroine. The breaker of all stereotypes. 📖Mac is unapologetically:shallowselfisharrogantspoiledadores pinkbreathes fashionvain since the day she was bornlooks like a barbiewears tees that spell JUICY on them fully understands she might not be the wisest person in the room.But Mac is also:smarter than she looksloyal to a faultprotectiveSHE WILL beat a bitch upstubborn in the best (and worst) wayswill slaughter for youdie for yourearrange the entire world for you okay fine not you, but for Jericho Barrons (H)💯


“You don’t have the right to call me Jericho.”“Why? Because we haven’t been intimate enough? I’ve had sex with you in every possible position, killed you, fed you my blood in the hopes that it would bring you back to life, crammed Unseelie into your stomach, and tried to rearrange your guts. I’d say that’s pretty personal. How much more intimate do we have to get for you to feel comfortable with me calling you Jericho? Jericho.


I won't deny Mac could really annoy the fuck out of you sometimes. She is a very flawed character and will never be perfect. It's why I don't hate on her as much as many people do. Some seem to forget that she was thrown into absolute insanity only 2 months ago (in her mind). In that time she has gone through a WORLD of change. Had I been in her position, I don't think I would've done a thing differently. With that being said, from a reader's POV, she did act a lil dumb a time or two, but she always comes around.📖 The slowest of slow burns. 📖Frustratingly slow. Like MZ has nothing on this evil woman. It was so painful yet so good😩😩. There came a point where I would openly salivate at any crumb of intimacy between the two.Barrons: shows even the tiniest, most irrelevant hint of jealousy towards Mac.Me:

“You can’t protect me forever.” He gave me a look that said, Are you crazy? Of course I could

 Did I want more romance? Yes.Was I mad that there wasn't more romance? NO.Did I really really need more smut? I don't know what the hell happened to me in the two years since I first read this....but back then I was completely content with the amount of raunchiness Karen provided. Now I have turned into an insatiable monster who feeds on smut for sustenance. Although Moning is the QUEEN of vague (but still hot) sex scenes. She is also a queen of sexual-tension-induced blue balls. Kid you not....I've had DREAMS about some of these scenes.📖 Unpredictable plot with twists and turns you'll have a hard ass time predicting 📖 (mostly in the 5th book)There were so many crazy moments where my jaw dropped in astonishment with questions like: Did the author really just do that!? and How the fuck are the characters going to get out of these situations??? Karen spared me no chaos and left not a nerve intact.📖 The most eloquent world-building I've read in a while. 📖Just the complexity of it all. The unveiling of the world was done so fucking well. You learn something new in each book and would never be left without guessing.These visuals and the art>>>>>>>

Where Seelie feet touch the earth, the snow melts with a hiss. Steam rises and flowers push up through cracks, blooming brilliantly, anointing the air with the scents of jasmine and sandalwood. The Seelie end of the street is bathed in golden light. Where my army’s hooves and scaled bellies pass over the stones, a crust of black ice forms. The night embraces us; stealthy shadows, we ooze forward from the blackness.

❗A PENIS AHEAD❗ you've been warned, don't report my review<3 I liked the whole backstory with the unseelie king and his concubine for many reasons and one of them is this STUNNING quote😩 (which is so much more impactful in the moment):The thought that she’d left him by choice had driven him mad.But she hadn’t. She’d been taken.He’d loved her for all time.Before she was made.After he’d believed she was gone.Sunshine to his ice. Frost to her fever.I wished them forever.
Okay but......how does it fit tho👀 with details plz Karen, thank you.📖 random humour thrown in, which lights your mood instantly amongst all the darkness and unknown. 📖The undiluted joy I'd feel every time I saw either of the MCs be happy?? Unparalleled. These books are deeply atmospheric in a gothic/bleary type of way, almost like a fever dream (and the titles make sense now). Couple that with all the crazy shit blasting from every corner, the characters barely ever had the time to just be. So when they did, my ass sat there like: But it was also the moments I knew for sure I'll never forget.It's rare for me to write reviews where 99% of it is actually positive. Raving about books is so much harder, how do y'all do it😫. The strain of keeping all that negative energy at bay is getting to me. I really turned into a whole ass different bitch out here. I call that character development💅I hope I shall not be back to my usual complaining ways when I continue on with the rest of the series. PS: you do not need to read further than book 5, since there is a satisfying ending in Shadowfever. BUT the story does continue and not everyone says it's good, hence my hesitance to finish.Overall: My love for the fever world is irrational and I probably overhyped it waaay too much. Karen, write another series plz so I have a reason to be nice again.Links to my random, separate thoughts on each book:Darkfever [1] 4.5 starsBloodfever [2] - 4 starsFaefever [3] - 4.5 starsDreamfever [4] - 5 starsShadowfever [5] - 5 starsFever Moon [5.5] - 3.5 stars
