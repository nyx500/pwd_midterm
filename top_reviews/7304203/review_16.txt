Finally , we got our answers!And it was awesome to know the truth.Mac The previous book was a total cliffhanger and when this one started I was so curious to read about how she managed to save herself from the beast but instead of that she was babbling .And then.....  I was waiting 4 bloody books to know what Barrons is and in the beginning of this one I read that she killed him?That was awful but I'm not a fool.I knew that somehow Barrons would be back again.In her desperation she becomes Darroc's ally and someone gets really pissed with her actions. Mac in this book learned the truth about her past and she was proved to be very strong and like always she was such a badass.J. BarronsSexy beastJust in case you dont know him Barrons is not the guy who will bring you chocolates and flowers on the Valentine's day.Enough with the eyecandy.Well in this book we finally learn what he is.Personally I didnt expect him to be what he was .I had other theories but I loved this explanation a lot. He has also secrets and he must find the book in order to make his life easier.V'laneFucking traitor , that's all I have to say.DaniGosh seriously??? I didnt see that coming. Learning the truth about Dani was heartbreaking. I dont know how I should feel about her.I loved her but what she did made me feel weird while I was reading about her.Something that I loved about this bookBarrons and Mac=L.F.EIt was about time.“He pulls me around and kisses me. "You're Mac," he says. "And I'm Jericho. And nothing else matters. Never will. You exist in a place that is beyond all rules for me. Do you understand that?"I do.Jericho Barrons just told me he loves me.”This book is disturbing in a good way. The moment when we get our answers something else happens and the story becomes more and more interesting.I swear you will love the last chapters .“Love knows no right or wrong. Love is.Only is.”Favorite quote
