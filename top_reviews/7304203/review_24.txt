After the overwhelming beginning of Dreamfever, you may think that Mac had enough – at least at her personal life. The world goes to hell anyway. So at least now Mac will be content about everything she has succeeded so far, there will be a new start in her relationship with Barrons and she will defeat the bad guys and avenge her sister.Wrong!Firstly, Shadowfever starts with Mac feeling greatly guilty about what she thinks she has done. She is going nuts about the man/monster she thinks that she has killed.Secondly, the relationship that she has with Barrons will drive you crazy. One time they are hot together. Other times you feel that you are back at book 1 and they are tiptoeing around each other.Thirdly, what bad guys? Who is the enemy?There are so many twists and turns in this book, that you will feel a headache before you finish it. It has been a complex story from book 1, anyway. Trust me, in Shadowfever you will keep guessing until the very end. Possibly you may want to go back and reread the books, because NOW YOU KNOW.The good thing is that there is not a cliffhanger in this book. Nevertheless, it does not provide a “Happily Ever After”. The ending is more like a “Happy For Now” for the main characters. And the most evil/devious character has a “Not Happy For Now” ending.I haven’t read book 9 “Feversong” yet, but I have a strange feeling that he will be back.Advice: Keep you schedule clear when you start the book! You will not let it go from your hands until it is finished.Favorite quote: “Some people bring out the worst in you, others bring out the best, and then there are those remarkably rare, addictive ones who just bring out the most. Of everything.They make you feel so alive that you'd follow them straight into hell, just to keep getting your fix.”
