What a tedious read, it actually pains me to say that, this book is my sixth by Abercrombie and the last in this series and it sucks. Reading it was just so hard, everything was unnecessarily long and monotonous when it shouldn't be, the plot was actually a good one but the potrayal was terrible, if that isn't even an understatement.
‘Courage lies in bearing the costs. We all have our regrets, but not all of us can afford to be crippled by them. Sometimes it takes small crimes to prevent bigger ones. Sometimes the lesser evil is the greater good. A man of principle must make hard choices and suffer the consequences. Or you could sit and cry over how unfair it all is.’
The world building even though monotonous and repetitive is not the worst I've read but I know the author can do better cause I've read his other works. The book os written in third person multiple POV which makes it more fun and informative to read.

The plot and characters were somewhat likable, and the return of a very and most likable of The First Law made a dramatic return in this, also Shivers and Nicoma Cosca consists of all the former characters in this series that made a return, the rest are all new. Shy South is the protagonist who lost everything when her house and farm got burnt down and her siblings got stolen, she and her stepfather made a tedious journey which they met some very weird people on the road to get them back.
