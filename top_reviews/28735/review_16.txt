I have a friend who refused to read GRR Martin because it's "boy fantasy."When I asked her for an example of non-boy fantasy, she pointed out, among others, this book.I was expecting a strong female in distinctly female situations, perhaps with more intrigue or relationship focus, but this book out boys the boys. It is probably the most manly fantasy I've ever read--battles, camping, training, military life. The only thing that's really female about it is that the main character is a woman.She's a woman who's good at everything manly: riding, hunting, killing. The story is so militantly feminist (women can and probably should do anything) that it was a little insulting.One thing I can say, though. The sex scenes aren't trashy. But they're there.
