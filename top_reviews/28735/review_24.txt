3 stars, a lighthearted and fun readBy the Sword is a standalone tale about the Kerowyn as she becomes a mercenary and works for Valdemar. It's pretty standards as far as Valdemar stories go and Kerowyn is an okay protagonist (she does start out with some early 90s "I'm not like other women" energy that thankfully gets toned down as she matures). The story does feel a bit like a placeholder to bridge the Vows and Honor with the main story of Valdemar but for what it is it's a quick and fun read especially after Kerowyn officially starts her mercenary training. It's a solid Valdemar book if you already like them.
