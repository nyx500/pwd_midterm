I’ve read this book so many times I actually need to get a new copy because my copy is falling apart. I love Kerowyn and you see her in many of the other Valdemar books so if you have read those and wonder how she became who she is, this book tells her story. Readers see Kerowyn turn from this sheltered young girl into one of the top mercenary in the mercenary guild.The book is basically broken up into two parts. The first part follows Kerowyn as she is taken in by her grandmother, Kethry, and retired mercenary, Tarma. Tarma basically takes Kerowyn under her wing and hones her into a deadly weapon and gives her the confidence to go out and make a living on her own and not depend on a man to take care of her.The second half of the book is Kerowyn’s entry into a mercenary guild, her rise in the ranks and eventually the job that takes her into Valdemar to meet the Heralds and Companions. And just maybe will she find true love with a man who views her as an equal?
