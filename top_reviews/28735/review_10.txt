This is the book that unites the Vows & Honor books with what I consider the "main arc" of the Valdemar universe. However, if you're reading this book because you want to read about a lot of Heralds and Companions, you're going to be disappointed.Kero has a bit of "not like those other girls" but I think it's a bit different in that she doesn't know how she fits in at the beginning. The first section is a bit of a fun coming of age, but the story really kicks up with the last two-thirds of the novel, and the ending dovetails with where we left the Kingdom of Valdemar at the end of Arrow's Fall.I liked how independent Kero was and how she eventually learned to see from another's perspective with experience.
