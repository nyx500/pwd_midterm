full breakdown review posted
*clears throat*WHAT IN THE HELL WAS THIS AND WHY IN THE HELL DID IT ENDThank you, that is all.Yeah right, that‚Äôs not even NEAR all the word-vomiting i have to do to express what this series is to me. There isn‚Äôt going to be any outward spoilers however i never said anything about it being a coherent well-presented review ü§óü§óü§ó Once upon a time, in a land long since burned to ash, there lived a youngprincess who loved her kingdom ‚Ä¶
 let me just start off by saying that this book made me cry a RIDICULOUS amount of times. when the characters were hurt: tears. when they were happy: weeping. when they cracked a joke: S O B B I N G Aelin described my current state best when she said, ‚Äù‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have a terrible headache from all this crying, and you‚Äôre not helping.‚Äùim not even joking, my eyes were so red and puffy and I think my tear ducts expanded and I got dehydrated from all the crying I endured. THERE WAS SO MUCH HEARTBREAK AND PAIN IN THIS BOOK GAHHHH as you can clearly see, all the evidence points towards sarah j maas being the one who has ruined my life mrs. I‚Äôd like to sincerely thank you for thatOKAY LET‚ÄôS GET ON WITH THE CHARACTERS OR ELSE WE‚ÄôRE GOING TO BE HERE ALL NIGHT
*aelin*
  "The words were a gentle brush down her cheek. Fireheart, why do you cry? And from far away, deep within her, Aelin whispered toward that ray of memory, Because I am lost. And I do not know the way"
-	my baby, my sweet, my child-	I know a lot of people are generally //opposed// to aelin bc of her ‚Äòarrogance‚Äô and ‚Äòselfishness‚Äô but y‚Äôall SHES 19 GIVE HER A BREAK-	also she‚Äôs hilarious and who the heck doesn‚Äôt want to have their queen a witty little bish-	but in this book she broke me-	she was so tortured and hurt and betrayed and yet she KEPT ON GOING FOR THE SOLE HOPE THAT SHE WOULD GIVE HER PEOPLE ANOTHER CHANCE IM EMOTIONAL-	excuse me while I rock myself back to sleep-	also when she told [spoiler]: ‚Äú‚Ä¶and please do rot in hell.‚Äù I KNEW I CHOSE THE RIGHT CHARACTER TO STAN-	THE BLINKING üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
*rowan*
 "They‚Äôd walked this dark path together back to the light. He would not let the road end here."
-	OKAY mayyyyybe rowan uses the word ‚Äòmate‚Äô (cringe) a liiiiiittle too often but gUYS he‚Äôs TRYING HIS BEST-	I really loved rowan in this book, he‚Äôs precious and sad and loyal and I don‚Äôt care if hes like actually a 500 year old warrior, hes my baby-	I love love loved seeing him with the cadre and how his unconditional love for aelin took him so FAR and he still was willing to RISK IT ALL
*chaol & yrene*
 "Chaol Westfall has not failed them."
-	if I cant marry chaol then the next best choice is yrene-	honestly I LOVE this pairing so much, since tower of dawn we got to see them face such hardships whether it was personal issues or saving their world but THEY COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER SO NICELY-	I love wholesome, fierce, soft ships -	Yrene was really a star in this book-	Her character, her powers, her personality they were so wonderful and powerful and strong, shes SUCH a strong character
*aedion*
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this a fight worthy of a song‚Äù
-	I adore aedion with all my heart but this BOI WAS A REAL PIECE OF WORK IN THIS BOOK (read in disappointed mom voice)-	he was under a TON of pressure and it really got to him so yes he did act like a little bish and did and said awful and horrible thing to the people he loved and I COULDN‚ÄôT FORGIVE HIM FOR IT RIGHT AWAY but towards the end we were all weepy mush-	aedion‚Äôs fierce unconditional love for his cousin is the reason why I still cry myself to sleep-	AEDION‚ÄôS DAD MOMENT FJKLAJFLKAJFLKAJ
*lysandra & evangeline*
 ‚ÄúEvangeline is my heir‚Äù
-	what would this book be without lysandra-	honestly her ferocious ability to keep fighting and fighting no matter how hurt or distraught or challenged she was-	an honest to goodness queen-	HER RELATIONSHIP WITH AEDION BROKE ME SO MANY TIMES-	i love how she came so far, from the first scenes where she was introduced and had this petty fight with aelin to see her now becoming one of her closest friends-	that‚Äôs character development right there-	AND THE WAY SHE MOMS EVANGELINE-	SO SWEET SO CUTE SO PRECIOUS-	I love this smol little family they‚Äôve built for themselves fjkldasjflkja-	 ‚ÄúWin me back my kingdom, Evangeline.‚Äù
*dorian*
  ‚ÄúSo Dorian kept fighting, his brother in soul and in arms beside him.‚Äù
-	if you asked me like 10 days ago, I would have told you this book would have been better without dorian-	BUT HEY SJM TWISTING MY EMOTIONS ONCE AGAIN WHAT ELSE IS NEW-	Dorian DID SUCH A GOOD JOB-	he was such an annoying brat in the previous books but HE REALLY TOOK CHARGE and built himself not only a personality but also a kingdom worthy of fighting for-	love me some character development 
*manon*
 ‚ÄúBe the bridge, be the light. When iron melts, when flowers spring from fields of blood‚Äîlet the land be witness, and return home.‚Äù 
-	oh goodness where do I start-	during the beginning of the book, I was worried that manon would be overshadowed by the other characters are their intense plots -	but damn this girl doesn‚Äôt let you forget about her-	I LOVE MANON BLACKBEAK AND I WANT TO GIVE HER HOT CHOCOLATE AND TUCK HER IN BED-	She was like this fiery queen that would actually stab a bi*ch but is intensely loyal and trustworthy once you take the time to earn her trust and respect-	That‚Äôs to say, she is my whole world-	AND SHE DESERVED SO MUCH BETTER-	Her close knit relationship with the 13, absolutely stellar. To see the way they live and defend each other, no matter the cost, fricken hell im weak
*elide & lorcan*
 ‚ÄúFor however long we have.‚Äù 
-	Elide is like this smol-barely-5-foot-girl and lorcan is a huge-500-year-old-fae-warrior and everytime he breathes near her she‚Äôs like nO and he turns into a wounded puppy-	THAT IS TO SAY,,,,,,,THEY ARE PRECIOUS-	Their relationship REALLY went through a lot and if there‚Äôs any ship that progressed in THE SLOWEST WAY POSSIBLE it‚Äôs probably theres (which yes, makes it more realistic but it only hurts me)-	elide proved herself time and time again how her disability DOES NOT define her and how she is so strong and capable and she doesn‚Äôt need saving-	I thought their relationship had a lot of depth and was very real and raw and I love them sm-	AND THE WAY THEY ENDED THEIR STORY üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ WHY ARE ALL MY BABIES SO SOFT
*the cadre*
 ‚Äú And together, they would do so, cadre once more.They would fight for this kingdom‚Äîtheir new court. Their new home.‚Äù 
-	SO CLEARLY FENRYS IS THE BEST-	ONE OF MY ABSOLUTELY FAVOURITE CHARACTERS EVER-	HE. IS. SO. HURT.-	This boy, I want to protect my gosh I literally cried so much over his storyline and the horrors he faced-	THE. BLINKING.-	Oh my god im going to cry again-	Gavriel is a close second -	His love for his son is unmatched, it was so beautiful to watch how he would do anything just to make his son proud and happy-	I LOVE healthy (okay that‚Äôs a stretch but theyre all trying) PARENT-CHILDREN relationships-	:‚Äô) wow here come the tears again-	I just wish we got to see more of them-	I feel like throughout the entire book, beautiful scenes were cut short due to the page constraint (ikr, 1000 pages and still not enough)THESE CHARACTERS FEEL LIKE THEY ARE A PART OF ME AND IM SO SAD THAT ITS ALL OVER AND THEIR STORIES HAVE FINISHED AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN ONLY PUT A FRACTION OF WHAT I FEEL INTO WORDSHow am I expected to go on like this :( :( :( :( :( Im going to shut up now but I just wish I could revisit this world back from the start and see these dear characters and see them happy and joking and living their best lives while staying hydrated and eating their veggies and drinking their juice boxes This has truly been an experience.
‚ÄúWe came to honor a promise made to Aelin Galathynius. To fight for what she promised us.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd what was that?‚Äù‚ÄúA better world.‚Äù
