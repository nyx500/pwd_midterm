#0.1-#0.5 The Assassin’s Blade ★★★★★#1 Throne of Glass ★★★★★#2 Crown of Midnight ★★★★★#3 Heir of Fire ★★★★★#4 Queen of Shadows ★★★★★#5 Empire of Storms ★★★★★#6 Tower of Dawn ★★★★★This was absolutely incredible, gorgeous, action-packed, everything I wanted it to be.It also hurt me very badly and I will probably never forgive Sarah J. Maas for one of the chapters in this book, but really, emotional ruination at the hands of SJM is a feeling I'm well accustomed to, so who's counting?RTC
