I bet you thought you'd never see a new announcement in here! *lol*But I actually have two things to say:1.) I'm on BookTube now! =)2.) Even more important: I finally finished writing this review! After TWO years you can read it in it's full 5.500+ words glory! Unfortunately not on GR because it would blow up the word limit but if you really want to read it you can do it over: here! ;-P Thank you all for waiting so long! I hope it was worth the wait! *lol*Okay, I think I'll faint now that it's done! Bye! XD________________________How is it possible that my heart is so full of love but feels so empty at the same time?This book broke me in the worst and best way possible and I’m so happy and sad…I have no words except of:This world and those characters will stay with me forever… <333My heart is aching and bleeding and hurting so damn much. T_TI just can’t write anything coherent right now because I’m drowning in an endless sea of feels. Full RTC once I’m emotionally stable again…I dunno if this is ever going to happen though…I.AM.HEARTBROKEN!___________________________PEOPLE!!!! Buckle up!!This is no drill! THIS IS FINALLY
