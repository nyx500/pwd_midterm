Rereading this was both an immense joy and a mistake. Everything hurts but I’m so happy right now. ——————————————I mean, I’d be happy to swear a blood-oath to Sarah J Maas. So many thoughts were running through my mind whilst I was reading this, but now that I have reached the ending of this book, I’m just a mess of tears and emotions and I don't know how to express how much it all means to me. I think I can safely say that this is my favourite book of all time. It was transcending. Sarah J Maas is a Dreamer, and I don’t think any book has fulfilled my dreamer’s heart as much as this book. It satisfied me to no end. All my hopes and dreams were placed in these characters and their world and for the cause they fought for. It hit me deep and it has carved itself into me and gratitude alone does not cover the feeling I have in my heart right now. You write and read stories and dream up better worlds, so you can find some hope in time’s of bleakness, to get by, to will yourself to live another day, and look towards a future that is better than what you’ve experienced and are living. Hope emanated throughout my course of reading these books and what I was left with. All of their lives intertwined so beautifully, kindness being repaid with infinite kindness and I was being taught over and over again that goodness outshines and outlives everything. And then the acknowledgements happened... I’m just done with my emotions getting trampled all over. I such an awesome time reading this with Azrah! The support was needed. 😆😘I’m going to go onto my mourning phase now, which’ll last for... let’s not even go there.  ——————————————
