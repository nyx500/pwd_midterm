when i tell u, i grew up listening to these nonstop, day & night, 24/7 i am not joking!! also the lion, the witch, & the wardrobe was my JAM & by far superior to the rest of the books! but when it comes to the radio theater part i also choose the voyage of the dawn treader, the sliver chair & the horse and his boy.
