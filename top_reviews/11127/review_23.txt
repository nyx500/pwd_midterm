This is one of my all time favorite book series. Seriously, TCoN (and LotR!) is what I grew up on. I never really attempted to review it (I'm not really going to try now) because I don't even know what I can say about it that will accurately express how much I love this series and how big of an impact it had/has on my life, both now and when I first read it when I was just a little kid.Of course I do like some of the books more than others—I do have my favorites—but overall, this whole series is just so great.This series will always hold a special place in my heart. I encourage you to read it, even if you think you're too old for it!

And this book is SO one of those books that can be enjoyed by all ages—over and over again. 😊
