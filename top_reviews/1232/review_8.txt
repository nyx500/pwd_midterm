This is a book about books, a story about stories. It starts and ends in a library of sorts, themes and plots are echoed across decades, tied together by actors who find their roles changing, and by a pen that links two cycles of the story and has its own tale that started before and goes on beyond."the art of reading is slowly dying, it's an intimate ritual, a book is a mirror that offers us only what we already carry inside us, when we read, we do it with all our heart and mind, and great readers are becoming more scarce by the day.”Zafón is a master of prose, he is eminently quotable even in translation. The story is set in Barcelona and stretches from the turn of the 19th century to the sixties, though focusing most heavily in post civil war Spain recovering in the 40s and 50s. It's a bitter sweet story, as much about the slow acceptance of loss as about fighting against it or finding happiness."Most of us have the good or bad fortune of seeing our lives fall apart so slowly we barely notice it."The setting is vividly brought to life. Many of the characters live in poverty or close to it, and the ventures into Paris bring to mind Orwell's descriptions. Barcelona is the star of the piece though."one of the many places in Barcelona where the nineteenth century had not yet been served its eviction notice"Shadow of the Wind is a love story, or two love stories, or several love stories to be honest. We focus on Daniel, a young man growing up, and becoming obsessed with the story of another man, a writer whose young life (decades earlier) is unfolded for us through Daniel's investigations. Both of them finding difficult and potentially tragic love."Her voice was pure crystal, transparent and so fragile I feared that her words would break if I interrupted them."The Shadow of the Wind has a lot to say about books and reading, rather less to say about the business of writing though."Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you.""Novels, as everyone knew, were for women and for people with nothing better to do."It's a complex interwoven plot, not without threat and violence, with a series of reveals that undermine what you think you know.A fascinating and lovely read, and a nice break from the fantasy books that I have read almost exclusively over the last 5 years.Give it a try!
