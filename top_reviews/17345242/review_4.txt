A Team Rocket Read!__________________________________________
"And so I set myself to work once more at my forge, to make new and notable matter around the masterworks of the long-dead maesters who came before me. What follows herein sprang from that desire: a history of deeds gallant and wicked, peoples familiar and strange, and lands near and far."
What can be better for a fantasy fanatic who is also a history student than to read a history book from one of his favourite fantasy universes?The world of Ice and Fire is a wonderful place, and the amount of detail that has now been put into it makes it one of the most intricate and advanced fictional worlds in literary history. There are so many places, people, cultures and religions that most fantasies pale by comparison. I think everyone on Goodreads have heard of A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. Most fantasy lovers here will also have read it. But the story behind the great epic; the tales of the Age of Heroes, of the grand empires of Ghis and Valyria; of all the great migrations into Westeros and all the kings who sat the Iron Throne prior to Robert’s Rebellion. Those tales are told in this book, alongside many, many others.And told in an absolutely wonderful way…There are two very interesting things to note about how this book is written. First, it reads like a history textbook, not a novel. And it is a history textbook. At least up until the point where it becomes a geography textbook instead. In any case, this is not a book you read to get excitement and suspense. It’s a book you read to learn more about the wonderful world in which George R.R. Martin’s books are set, and to bask in its awesomeness from beginning to end.Second, it’s written as an in-world book. The author is not George R.R. Martin, but rather Maester Yandel of the Citadel. We see the world and the stories in it from the perspective of a man who lives there. An academic, so to say. There are several interesting details in the book making this fact even more believable and immersive, like a very interesting dedication in the very beginning.Many people have called this GRRM’s version of the Silmarillion, and that’s not completely true. It’s similar in that this is also a collection of tales providing a captivating backstory for the world described in the main series, but it’s also a wholly different type of book. This doesn’t have the magical beauty and grace of Tolkien’s masterpiece, but it is absolutely incredible in its own way.I assume that anyone who’s interested in this are already ASoIaF fans who have read all five published books. But in case there are people reading this who are not and have not, let me say this: I would only recommend this book to those who fit into both those categories. If you haven’t read ASoIaF, you should read that first. If you have read one or more of the books and didn’t like them, there is absolutely no reason for you to read this. You’re definitely missing out if that last case is true, but that’s more because of the splendor of ASoIaF itself than this book.The writing is good, but it’s just there. This is not a book where you care about the writing. You only care about what is written about. The stories. The legends.And the artwork is even better, providing an excellent addition to a book that would have been amazing even without it. Some of my favourite fantasy artists are here, specifically Magali Villeneuve and Ted Nasmith. You can see some of their works, and those of the other greatly talented artists, in the bottom of this review, coupled with quotes from the different chapters.__________________________________________The Age of Heroes lasted for thousands of years, in which kingdoms rose and fell, noble houses were founded and withered away, and greet deeds were accomplished. Yet what we truly know of those ancient days is hardly more than what we know of the Dawn Age. The tales we have now are the work of septons and maesters writing thousands of years after the fact—yet unlike the children of the forest and the giants, the First Men of this Age of Heroes left behind some ruins and ancient castles that can corroborate parts of the ancient legends, and there are stone monuments in the barrow fields and elsewhere marked with their runes. It is through these remnants that we can begin to ferret out the truth behind the tales.__________________________________________Sheltered there, amidst the great volcanic mountains known as the Fourteen Flames, were the Valyrians, who learned to tame dragons and make them the most fearsome weapon of war that the world ever saw. The tales the Valyrians told of themselves claimed they were descended from dragons and were kin to the ones they now controlled.__________________________________________Sweeping through the Vale with fire and sword, the Andals began their conquest of Westeros.__________________________________________And the dragons came. Not three, as Prince Garin had faced at Volon Therys, but three hundred or more, if the tales that have come down to us can be believed. Against their fires, the Rhoynar could not stand. Tens of thousands burned whilst others rushed into the river, hoping that the embrace of Mother Rhoyne would offer them protection against dragonflame... only to drown in their mother’s embrace.__________________________________________There upon the south bank of the Trident, he knelt, laid the ancient crown of the Kings of Winter at Aegon’s feet, and swore to be his man. He rose as Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, a king no more. From that day to this day, Torrhen Stark is remembered as the King Who Knelt...__________________________________________Thus were the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros hammered into one great realm, by the will of Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters.__________________________________________No war was ever bloodier or crueler than the Dance of the Dragons, as the singers and Munkun have chosen to name it. It was the worst kind of war — a war between siblings.
