George R.R. Martin is a freaking genius.You get hints and glimpses of the world beyond Westeros and Slaver's Bay in the A Song of Ice & Fire series, but only after you've read this volume do you truly understand the staggering weight of it. There're are so many countries (Skagos, Butterfly Isles, Asshai), each with their own history and culture, it's a wonder George can remember it all.It also provides a comprehensive history of the lay of the land pre-Targaryen rule, ranging from the children of the forest to the battle between the Andals and the First Men to everyone who died when Aegon the Conqueror came. Notable Houses get their history listed out too, so we get a full blow-by-blow of the bloody Targaryen Civil War and the subsequent Blackfyre rebellions. Young Griff is definitely not a Targaryen. The whole ploy stinks of Blackfyre schemes.If you're like me and praying to the old gods and the new for George to finish wrap up the series, this'll tide you over for now. A bit dry (it's technically a history textbook), but a must-read for ASOIAF fans.
