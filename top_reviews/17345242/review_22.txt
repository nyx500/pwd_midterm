Loved it. But I'll be holding off rating and reviewing until my hard copy arrives because this book, while great on audio, needs to be seen and grasp with your hands to fully appreciate it. Apart from that, this was a treasure. I'm so in love and obsessed with this world and this book fueled my love for it even more.Informative and sprawling in its coverage...I wish I read the hardback version first before the audio. It would have been even more magical.
