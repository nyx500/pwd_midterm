Well! It's been a few days since I finished 
The Crimson Campaign
 and my opinion hasn't changed. This was definitely better than the first book. More action, more magic, and above all else more gritty determination by our lead characters. Brian McClellan is putting the flintlock fantasy genre on the map. The multiple POV's are done extremely well. Taniel and Ka-poel are by far my favorites. Adamant came in second, with Tamas following in third.Adro's war with the Kez is in full swing, but there is still a struggle for power in Adro's capital city of Adopest that may be effecting the war effort. Oh, and let's not forget the fact that there are gods walking around causing their own mischief. I have no idea how this is going to end, but I am pretty sure it's going to be a bloody journey. Brian McClellan has created an extraordinary world in 
The Powder Mage trilogy
. One that has been truly entertaining to read. I am looking forward to reading book 3. 5 stars *****
