The artwork is ✨STUNNING✨Truly masterful.But there was not much dialogue or story. For 384 pages, not much happens. But what did happen is fantastic.I definitely see myself giving the future volumes 5 stars.I really enjoyed Hades and Persephone as characters. The side characters are cute as well. I haven't become invested in them but I'm sure I will given time.It just seems like a lot of pages for so little to have developed.
