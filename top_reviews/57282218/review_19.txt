"What do you want then?""I want to feel loved and safe every day. Not sometimes. All the time." 💫

the art in this is just my favorite ever. i rly don't think i'd love the webtoon as much if it weren't for the unique style and colors. there were panels that i'd straight up just buy as wall artthe details too, like how sometimes her pink will rub off on him and vice versa 💙🌸the hades persephone myth invented grumpy/sunshine trope and that's a factother things i loved:🍬 height difference 😚🍬 hades being such a dog personpls not him blow drying him 😩✋🏽🍬 when artemis puts on her warrior garb🍬 eros and psyche <3🍬 EVERY TIME HADES STUTTER COMES OUT. it's truly peak cuteness🍬 sorry but minthe might be my fav character 🏃🏽‍♀️ i think she's a great example of how well-rounded the writing is. even tho she's an abusive, toxic, unlikeable character, she's not made to be one-dimensional. and episode 46 slapped i won't budge on that ☝🏽the fear in her eyes PLS. the way she hates herself to the point that she physically can't stand him still showing her affection when she's done every possible thing to push him away. alexa play boyfriend by ariana grande, i want a redemption arc
