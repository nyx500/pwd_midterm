"You don't need some amateur Goddess barging in on your Sunday morning.""I would pay you a salary to barge in on every single aspect of my life."Hades and Persephone are already so perfect ğŸ’˜ğŸ¤­ what the hell I'm obsessed!?!?!?The art is gorgeous and different from what I usually read in graphic novels so it just added more to my excitement. I loved the plot as it is the modern retelling of greek myths and the way the author draw the characters in this is just so unique, stylish and perfect. The story is about the myth of Persephone's abduction by Hades but in a modern world of friendships, lies and gossips and the wild parties where we get to see the different sides of greek gods. I started this last year but couldn't read more than 5 episodes and thanks to Lila (you're the bestğŸ¥¹ğŸ«¶) whose review made me try this again and Lila guess what? I'm obsessed!!!âœ¦ Hades: I love how Grumpy he is sometimes and yet so soft for Persephone ğŸ¥º and the way he was jealous of his own dog Cerberus because Persephone was touching the dog ğŸ¥¹âœ¦ Persephone: The sweet pink cinnamon roll ğŸ’— she is my favourite and I want her to stand for herself and I know she tries her best but sometimes people like Apollo don't know the meaning of NOğŸ˜¤ and all I want for her is happiness!!!âœ¦ Eros: He is just perfect and such a sass queen in this and I can't wait to know more about him ğŸ˜Œ also I'm scared for him to be heartbroken and it already happened ğŸ˜­ but the way he loves Psyche is just ğŸ˜­ğŸ’˜
Psyche- "I love being here. It's like a dream....but I don't want to be a dream. I want to be real."Eros- "I love you and I want you to be happy. But right now, it's not safe for you to leave."
âœ¦ Psyche: I liked her but I'm so scared for her and Eros's story and I know they got their happy ending but the way they got it was just ğŸ˜­ and I'm not ready for it...âœ¦ Hera: She's funny and witty and I love how protective she is of Persephone ğŸ¥º I want more of her and Zeus since they both look so adorable in this!! âœ¦ Zeus: Man is so smitten with his wife lmaoğŸ¤£ğŸ˜­ I love his relationship with Hades and Poseidon ğŸ¤£ the trio I didn't knew I needed!!âœ¦ Artemis: she's so funny, lovely and so damn better than her brother. And the way she said that boys are not allowed in her house but then let Eros in because he brings donuts for her and Persephone ğŸ¤£ğŸ’—âœ¦ Minthe: I hate her that's all and I know she's going to behave like a bitch in the upcoming storyline ğŸ˜ âœ¦ Demeter: Artemis once said "Demeter is such a fucking helicopter." And It's the truth. And the way she trapped her own daughter is horrible ğŸ˜­âœ¦ Apollo: Someone kill him already ğŸ˜ ğŸ”ª he's such a piece of shit and how the hell he fucking did that to my sweet Persephone ğŸ˜ ğŸ˜¤ğŸ”ªğŸ”ª Die Die Die!! The ending in this was just sad ğŸ˜­ It was lovely too see how Hades was so smitten by Persephone. I hated how trapped Persephone feels and that she needs to prove herself ğŸ˜­ She deserves the world and Hades!!! I NEED MORE OF THEM!!!This is addicting and why the hell didn't I read this before!?? "Better late than never." I guessğŸ˜Œ So excited to read more of it!!!
