i am always going to be here for a Hades and Persephone retelling! but sadly, i didnt love this one. but i still had a good time reading it and i loved the art and color palette. i do feel like the next installment would be even better and i am very intrigued to picked it up! (also maybe this was just overhyped a little bit subconsciously for me too... because even my b&n here in vegas, they have a huge display dedicated to this series! so... take my star rating with a very big grain of salt bc i am for sure not the popular opinion here!) <3✰ read for free on webtoon ♡ buddy read with Penny author's cw/tw published in book: physical + mental abuse, sexual trauma, and toxic relationshipsmore tw/cw that i wrote down: drinking, drugging, blackmail, captivity, kidnapping, parental abuse, paparazzi/stalking, blood depiction, rape, sexual coercion, unwanted sexual pictures being taken, anxiety depiction, trauma depiction, and disassociating while something traumatic is happening.
