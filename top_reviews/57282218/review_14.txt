Persephone, the goddess of spring, was raised by her mother, Demeter in the mortal realm. Persephone is allowed to live in the glamorous world of Olympus after she promises to train as a sacred virgin. When Artemis, her roommate takes her to a wild party she meets Hades, the charming god of the Underworld and she feels a spark with him. Persephone must learn the relationships and politics in Olympus as well as discover her own place and power. I loved this book so much! This was a fantastic retelling of Hades and Persephone about love, power, politics and discovering your place in the world. I loved that the author created a modern age perspective of Hades and Persephone in a graphic novel format, it was refreshing. The art and illustrations in this novel are beautiful. I love Hades and Persephone so much! I love how sweet and kind Hades is to Persephone. Persephone she is so nice, caring and helpful. I also really liked Eros and Artemis. I appreciate that the author mentioned content warnings in the second page of the novel. I'm so excited to read the next book! I recommend this graphic novel to anyone who loves mythology, romance and Hades and Persephone retellings.
