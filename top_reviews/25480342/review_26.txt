I really liked this cleverly told tale. Connor, a young lad of 13 years has an encounter with a monster. His mother is suffering from cancer, at school he's bullied, his father has a new family... the monster tells him four tales. What are they about? Why is it a rather philosophical horror novel you can learn a lot in? Well, I don't give any spoilers here but this heart warming story is a quick read with some eerie elements and lot of suspense. Convincing characters, an interesting monster (Green Man concept) and a good plot. Absolutely enjoyed it and can highly recommend that marvelous book!
