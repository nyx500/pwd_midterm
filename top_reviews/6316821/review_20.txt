This is a great series, I really enjoyed it, enjoyed the characters, etc., etc. But there's a but. I think it would be so much better if it were half the length.Loved the first 3, probably 4. Five and six just became a bit of a rough slog for me. It might be that, (1) it was relatively forgettable, but also, (2) maybe it's just me and I'm getting tired of very traditional fantasy.And this is very traditional fantasy. It's well-done and enjoyable, but I think it just wore me down after a while. I really don't love this review, I'm sorry, I just can't seem to get pumped for this one. I enjoyed the book, the characters are fun (though Kitaii gets wearing), and it was all kinds of epic, but in the end I really just finished it to be done. I know I could have waited longer to finish, but by then I'd have to reread and I really really don't have the energy to do that.3.5 out of 5 stars (possibly more for the previous love of this series)
