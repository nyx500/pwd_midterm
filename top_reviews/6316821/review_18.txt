Gaius Octavian. Suuuuuper Genius. I wonder how many people think of Wile E. Coyote as possessing significant heroic qualities. Jim Butcher certainly does. No matter how crazy the plan or how painful the results, once restored, the coyote finds himself undeterred and ready to strap himself to a giant rockets and light the fuse. This is a quality enjoyed by the heroes of Alera who are always ready to try a crazy plan that never fails to leave them a bloody mess. They pay the price for their super genius in pain but thanks to the water crafters they are soon restored and ready for another round of punishment. Butcher has shown throughout this series and the Dresden Files that his characters are extremely vivid and his writing is driven by them more than by a meticulously crafted plot. The characters were consistent enough that some reactions are predictable which allows the reader to feel a certain sense of familiarity which I find satisfying. That consistency is decidedly missing from several recently popular books in which characters act entirely out of line with their previous behavior simply to serve the plot. Lazy writing is all the rage. Bottom line: I enjoyed this series a great deal and recommend it enthusiastically to fans of epic fantasy. Last item: Steak and New Boots. Brilliant.
