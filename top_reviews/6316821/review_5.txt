Oh Mr. Butcher, You are so good, you left me in sad/happy tears. I hated to say goodbye to Tavi after spending a year with him and his companions. I loved and hated them, they became a part of me. His story ended so well, so beautifully weaved through horrors, happiness and heartbreaks. I was there riding the moving earth with him and I was there for the signing of the final contract. What an amazing trip it has been.
