First, the usual caveats. I received an advance copy of this book, free, from the publishers. And I consider Joe Abercrombie a friend. I do not think that affects my review of this book.Joe Abercrombie continues to do what he does best. He sets up a very large chess board, with multiple pieces. Often several pieces are in motion at the same time, and as always, the pieces are all the same color. It is truly up to the reader to decide which faction they will cheer for, as the characters continue to defy the 'good' or 'bad' labels. This is a tale of brute force and subtle magic set in a world on the cusp of an industrial revolution. Buckle your seat belts for this one.A few things I will tell you up front. If you've never read any of Abercrombie's books, you can still jump right into his world with this one. There is just enough back story for each setting to make it real; never a mind-numbing re-chewing of events from a previous book. There are numerous characters. Some get a chance to reveal their point of view. Others keep their thoughts to themselves and let us judge for ourselves what they are pondering. Now, if you have read Joe's other books set in this world, you are in for a richer experience as familiar names, rivalries, hatreds and alliances are renewed, evolve and dissolve in this volume. The characters are memorable. Even with a large cast, I never had to fumble back to recall who was who, and what was going on. A Little Hatred is not a gentle book. Characters are shown at their best and their worst, and the full spectrum of what some are capable of can be appalling. This is a vivid and jolting tale. The fantasy elements of the book are subtle, the magic scarce and yet utterly essential to the plot.
