The new generation of inglorious bastards! Loved every single page of it and can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. As usual characters are very well written and the intrigues are very realistic, like you're reading some sort of an alternative history not a fantasy. And I love that this world is changing and growing like a real one. Former enemies became allies or poor refugees, old ways facing great challenges and the chaos seems eternal but live goes on. Bayaz is still annoying as hell though.
