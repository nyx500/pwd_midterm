“The wiser a man is, the more he stands ready to be educated.”I'm useless at updating what I have read on Goodreads, as my sons constantly tell me. But here's an attempt to rectify that slightly. I finished A Little Hatred over a year ago and of course, loved it. Joe Abercrombie is a master at what he does. From the humour, to characters, to plot. He is such a distinct writer, and someone that I know will always put out books I will love and devour. One of my favourite authors, and A Little Hatred shows me once again why he is. If you haven't already, you should dive into his works, starting with The Blade Itself.
