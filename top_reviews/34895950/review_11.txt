(3.5/5)AAAAAHHHHHH. THIS WAS SO CUTE. I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE LOVES THIS NOW.Just, two things:First, I felt that there wasn't much to the story? The further I got into the book, the more frantically I was hoping that there was going to be something that gave it a little more, I don't know, anything. By the time that I had finished, it felt really insubstantial. Like, yeah, sure, the art is adorable and there's an incredible amount of unforced diversity, but there was nothing moving the book forward. Which, let's be honest, is probably why it was so short. I mean, I would definitely read an entire book about cute little dragons (literally why else would I be here), but I feel like I was expecting something more from this, especially character-wise.While reading this, I felt that we were given a view out of a window into the story. While, yes, it kept everything light and charming, I didn't really connect/understand/appreciate the characters as much as I hoped I would.Of course, that being said, I absolutely LOVED the art. And the concept as a whole, really. I mean, come on people, TEA DRAGONS?? It was so cute and something I don't think I've really seen before, which means that I was left with no choice but to love it.Also, where could someone get a tea dragon of their own? Asking for a friend, of course.
