You should probably drop everything you are doing and read this. Seriously. Tell your boss I said it was alright. This is an overload of adorableness in both the story and artwork that just demands to be enjoyed. The Tea Dragon Society is a quick read, but it will reverberate for a long, long time. O'Neill does such excellent work with world building, creating this cozy society full of cute dragons that grow tea on themselves (drinking it allows you to experience the past memories of the tea masters, which is a psychedelic good time) and plenty of LGBTQ and racial representation that doesn't announce itself but is lovingly immersed into the story. It is a beautiful little book about friendships, honoring traditions and being proud of who you are and what you can do. Something I enjoy most is that at the end, O'Neill includes a Tea Dragon Handbook that details each of the dragon species with fun facts about them and some tea dragon lore. This is such a cute idea for a kids book as it gives them something to enjoy beyond reading the story (much like how kids love Pokemon guide books and such) while also expanding the world in which O'Neill created. There are--at present--two more books, each with variations on the handbook and both grahpic novels are just as fun.The artwork is OUTSTANDING. O'Neill has a such a charming style that is bright and full of color as well as an adorable cottagecore aesthetic (shoutout to the young library patron that informed me of this). This is such a good mood read that will tug your heartstrings and perhaps get you to cry a few tears. Utterly adorable and absorbing, drop everything to check this out.4.5/5
