The Review
Just a few short months after arriving at the courtyard, Meg has settled into life living with the Terra Indigine. Her blood prophesies have already saved the courtyard once and now she has seen a plot to attack the Crowgard with poisoned meat. But a group of terrorists aren't their only problem. The Controller who Meg escaped from has set into motion plans to recapture or kill her and he doesn't care who he kills along the way. And further muddying the waters is the interference of an outsider who is stirring up the humans to violence. Murder of Crows is a great second book. In some ways it's actually a better book than Book One, Written in Red which I thought dragged a little in the middle (not so with this one). That's about it, I have no complaints about this book.
