4, 5Hard to say why these books and I clicked, but clikced we did and I loved book 2 almost as much as book 1. It definitely falls under the category: nothing-is-happening-and-that-very-slowly-with-an-overload-of-mundane-minutia. And while there are books in this category I absolutely despised or at least felt super frustrated about, there are books within the very same category I just hug close to my heart. Why? I haven't the foggiest idea.But there it is and here am I. Will go on with the series.
