Three and a half stars.Don’t judge me. I just read book one in this series (Written in Red)–twice–and so what else was I to do but full speed to the second? Besides, there’s nothing like an addictive book to keep one wide awake through night shift, and the second installment in Bishop’s Others series continues to fit the bill. Yet while I enjoyed the second excursion to Bishop’s innovative urban fantasy world, I found it somewhat less engaging than the first.This series grabs on three accounts: one, the unusual conception of an alternate-history earth; two, the variety of non-humans; and three, a steady pace of new experiences as we move through the world. Unfortunately, while Murder largely repeats story elements of the first book, it somewhat compensates by fleshing out of the world beyond Lakeside. It becomes quite clear–if it wasn’t already–that while the humans may have the population, the Others have the elements on their side. Literally. Thus, while it is possible for the Others to lose small-scale skirmishes, they hold the ultimate weapon/ ‘solution’–an earthquake, landslide, hurricane or other natural disaster capable of destroying a town.Continued at:https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2014/...because Amazon.
