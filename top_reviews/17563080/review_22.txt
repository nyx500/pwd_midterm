This series is so addictive, I completely lost track of time reading book 2, was meant to read a little before bed and have ended up devouring the entire thing.In this book Bishop continues her tale with Meg, Simon and those who reside within and around Lakeside Courtyard. Again, the array of characters in the book add to the story, rather than creating a feeling that the author is trying to include too much. Bishop is wonderful at weaving together different strands in a way that flows and adds layers rather than creating confusion. A new drug, that sparks intense violence is running through the human population, causing/facilitating violence against The Others. This drug emerges as humans disgruntled by the power of The Others, and desiring more and more begin to gain a loud voice one that sets the spark to bloodshed, devastation, and potentially the destruction of humans in lands where they have been allowed to reside – something some humans seem to have forgotten and resent intensely. And so they foolishly underestimate the punishment/hell they will face for the crimes they commit.The question is, can the accord and growing bond between Meg, Simon, The Other residents of Lakeside Courtyard as well as its human employees and even the police force be used to highlight that mass bloodshed, erasing humans from the land is not the only way to go? Or will the tenuous truce between humans and The Others across Thaisia crumble and rot away as blood coats the land?I don't want to give anything away, so all I am going to say is that as things stand so far I would highly recommend this series, book 2 was another engrossing read, can’t wait to start the next one.
