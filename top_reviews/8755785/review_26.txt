(thankfully, we have more!)the unique magic system, the modern world Urban fantasy, the involving of vampires & werewolves, the supernatural nature of it, Angels versus Demons.in amount of my interest, the whole Shadowhunters chronicles (as one big series!) is probably my 5th favourite series, & my most favourite YA!I love it! the amount of fantasy, adrenaline & romance; balanced, beautiful.City of Heavenly Fire:Complete 5 heavenly Golden Stars3rd best of 2019This book filled me with thrills, chills, excitements, laugh, horror, tragedy, pain & agony. since the very first page.I laughed a lot, with the main sassy characters & also with the undiscovered Malcolm who revealed himself after so many books in Shadowhunter world, in this one.& I only cried harder (& longer!) than this one in two books: HP; the Deathly Hallows & they both Die in the end(I totally love when I cry over a book, so this is a good point)In other words, it was perfect!& this was the best one in the Mortal Instruments!Now I'm gonna sweep my shattered heart off the floor.
this review Might have spoilers about previous books
I love Sebastian! He was cunning, dangerous, schemer & charismatic! & his tragic past made my heart wrench & the fact that no one understands him (either in shadowhunters world or among the fans) is even more heartbreaking. I cried a lot.One of the best villains I've ever read.I would join him! I would love him. someone please give him a hug! (Clary, damn you!)& it's weird coming from me, a hero-lover.(please don't be rude in the comments)Alec, my sweetheart, you were awesome!I also always adored archers, especially when he is the serious, silent, clueless, composed, protective as the eldest one, always seeing sense, sometimes funny character. I loved it where he was the POV character, alas they were a few but they were awesome! I relate to him so much!in this book I felt my heart tore into 2 pieces; one for Alec & one for Sebastian.& I wished Sebastian would've gotten his redemption & been forgiven & survived, the scene was ready for the villain redemption, but Clare erased him & now I'm crying just by remembering it. is there any book in which the favourite lovable villain actually survive?Clare's heroines are good, I mostly like them. Clary & Tessa were sometimes annoying & stupid, so despite her stubbornness, Emma is my favourite female lead character. (TDA) you can read why in my review of Lady Midnightin TMI, I like Izzy. Clary was good sometimes & sometimes I wanted to punch her in the face. (including this book!)as in adults, I like Charlotte, Maryse & Jocelyn.But... I liked you Maia! after reading this book; I feel betrayed. She was good & strong but said something that ruined herself in my eye!I kept making hypothesis; none of them happened, to my astonishment!I was internally screaming in horror: I didn't see that coming!I love to see old characters. It was kind of Nostalgic. (tho I only started this, a year & a half ago) I read this series in 4 stops & every time I was Obsessed with someone else; first it was Alec, then it was Simon, now it is Sebastian (& Alec too, but more Sebastian)& I love there was a exclusive country only for them in this world; beside the institute, I want to go there!just it, thank you Cassie Clare! for this amazing world! <39 down, 3 to gothe dark artifices, I will come for you!-2019, 1st read: I finished 728 pages in 5 days & on Alec's birthday!
