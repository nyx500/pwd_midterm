Marissa Meyer in Interview: (paraphrased)"Winter decided not to use her Lunar gift. She experiences bad hallucinations and her mental state is deteriorating."ME:Winter is going to be such an interesting character I'm so excited! After Reading Cress So, without too many spoilers, I'm just going to leave this little exchange here: Winter:  "You shouldn't call me crazy. They don't like that." Other Character:  "But you are!" Winter:  "I know that I am. Do you know how I know? Because the walls of the palace have been bleeding for years and no one else can see it. ...If the blood was real, the servants would've cleaned it up by now, don't you think?"And my reaction:FAVORITE CHARACTER STATUS ACHIEVEDWHY DOESN'T THIS BOOK EXIST YET UPDATE Wow much likes. Many surprise. Such happy. Amaze. I'm really sorry for using doge like I am in college what am I even doing. But seriously thanks for all the likes, guys! I'm glad you enjoy my overly excited gif extravaganza. :)
