"I once spent the better part of a year inside of a large stomach, being digested."
Partly explains how it is turning out me this year so far.. I'm inside Roshar, way behind my reading challenge with Sanderson's 1000+ page books, but not regretting one single bit! Stormlight Archive re-defined what I knew to be book-addiction to a whole new level.I thought Way of the Kings was going to an all-time-fav for me, but Words of Radiance blows everything else out of the water! I'm going to forget about the challenge and keep going: this is too good to pause.Review to come.PS: There's a nice little surprise at the end, which will only make sense if you finished Warbreaker before.. So, thanks again, Mel! :D .. Your list has been invaluable!!
