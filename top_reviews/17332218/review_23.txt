Incredible! What a fantastic read! Brandon Sanderson, where have you been all my life? Lyrical, beautiful, out-of-this-world writing. How can a book be this voluminous, yet unpredictable at every turn? I love the surprises. The destination is never what you imagined it. I am hooked on the characters. I want more Shallan, Kaladin, The Kholins, even the whiny spineless King Elhokar. I want to see what will come off the twist about Szeth and Jasnah. Was Adolin right in doing what he did, and will there be consequences?Will we finally get some insight into who the heck Wit is?I am off to read the third book in the series, Oathbringers. I am having a fantastic time with this series. Five stars.
