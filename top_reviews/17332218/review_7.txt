An incredible work of writing that somehow surpasses the first book
Check out my new youtube channel where I show my instant reactions to reading fantasy books seconds after I finish the book.
If you are a fan of fantasy books, you've already read this book so I don't need to go into very much detail here.This book is incredible in virtually every way. While the prose of writing is not par with the greats in this genre, the worldbuilding and plot are the pinnacle of fantasy. The "wow" moments are unrivaled, and legitimately left me with goosebumps and teary eyed.I truly wish I could forget what happened in this book so I could go back through the experience of reading this for the first time.If you are even a little bit a fan of fantasy and haven't read this...stop what you are doing right now and go read this series.
