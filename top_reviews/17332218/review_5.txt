“Do not let your assumptions about a culture block your ability to perceive the individual, or you will fail.”Great 2nd read of Words of Radiance! Sanderson's world definitely holds up! I am ready for the experience to continue. On to Oathbringer!  2016 Review:Words of Radiance is the spectacular 2nd book in Brandon Sanderson’s Stormlight Archive. If you’re looking for an epic fantasy series, the Stormlight Archive is it! The world of Roshar keeps getting bigger and bigger (and, at the same time, more interesting). Words of Radiance picks up right where Way of Kings ended, and like the first book it is a fun and satisfying journey. The book will answer many of the questions you had after finishing Way of Kings while, of course, raising completely new questions. I’ve already reread this monster of a book (1,087 pages), but I’ll need to be patient. Some questions need to remain unanswered, I suppose, at least until I get to Oathbringer!
