I find myself having put off writing this review for a few weeks now. I am still at a loss for words. How do I deliver an appraisal of a book so 
mind-bogglingly fantastic
 that anything I write will fall short of conveying the joy of reading it? Words of Radiance might as well be my description of this book and not the title.WOR, being the second book in a ten book series called The Stormlight Archives, picks up right where The Way of Kings left off but does so at a faster pace. Where TWOK was a slow burn towards an amazing climax, WOR definitely has a faster burning fuse with an ending that surpasses the former by weight of sheer jaw-dropping moments.And those moments? 
They. Were. Astonishing.
 The Way of Kings rocked your boat? That rocking was just a slight vibration. It was the tremor of the water in the glass, the promise of something to come, and this book heralds the arrival and the full 
ROAR
 of the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
E-freaking-lectrifying.
 Yup. I’m making words up now. Maybe if I just found a shardplate helmet, threw in the words ambitious, grandeur, astounding, magnificence, stunning, masterly, extraordinary and blended them all together with a dash of stormlight, it would form the word that would start to give you an idea of the wonder of Words of Radiance.Brandon Sanderson just BROUGHT IT and dropped the mic before walking offstage.I should be worried for the rest of the series, as I cannot seeing him topping this, but then, he has already proven me wrong with this book.Go ahead and read this, you won’t be sorry. And if you find yourself nearing the end of the book and you are shouting and jumping and pointing towards the pages with exclamations of 
“HOLY GUACAMOLE BATMAN DID YOU JUST SEE THAT?!?!?!?
 “, just know that somewhere out there I am nodding my head and saying “I told you so!”Art by Ashley Coad
