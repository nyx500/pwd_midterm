“I think,” Hoa says slowly, “that if you love someone, you don’t get to choose how they love you back.”

I was actually not very excited when I got into this one after the disappointment of book 2. I am usually a fast reader but I decided to slow down a bit with this one, take my time and try to enjoy it as much as I can. I was on the verge of a slump when I started this book and I was really worried that this will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. It wasn’t!! I actually enjoyed what I was reading, specially at the beginning, I tried to make sure that I understood what happened till where I stopped reading and although it enhanced my experience, I don’t think I ended up loving this series as much as I thought I would.For a series that won the Hugo award 3 times, I expected my mind to be blown but I can’t say that it was. Book 1 was excellent and it was my favorite in the series and it was hard to come up with something as great just for the lone reason of how brilliant the narrative was in that one. I think Jemisin’s writing is not easy, I really need to focus to understand what is going on. I think it is not necessarily a bad thing as I have seen many readers falling in love with the prose but I don’t think I was the biggest fan.Essun and Nassun are certainly characters that I will remember because they were so well-written! I actually thought the third POV in this book was not as good and was actually boring and confusing which impacted my enjoyment and rating of the book. I have seen reviews after finishing the series and it looks like I am not the only one who had this feeling which makes me feel less bad! 

“How can we prepare for the future if we won’t acknowledge the past?”

The mix of fantasy/ sci-fi and dystopia is not something I was a very big fan of. I can say the magic system was cool but it was not complex and awesome as I thought it would be. I prefer hrad magic systems with rule and stuff and I thought the system here was more of a scientific rather than a fantasy one.Summary: For more than one reason, I think it is me not the books problem. I found this book well written, although challenging to read! With 2 out 3 interesting POVs and a cool magic system. The way the book and series was wrapped was not at all and that is another good thing about the series, I am finishing with a quote form the book itself: 

“To those who’ve survived: Breathe. That’s it. Once more. Good. You’re good. Even if you’re not, you’re alive. That is a victory.”
