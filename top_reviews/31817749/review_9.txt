Oh well gee, golly, gosh, let me just to review this masterpiece, no problem, easy peasy???
The further I get into a series, the harder it is for me to review each individual book because so much of my opinion relies on understanding everything that happened in the preceding books. More than usual, I find it so difficult to express what this series has made me feel. Just saying "it was amazing" or "it was mind-blowing" starts to feel repetitive & those common compliments don't really do the novel justice. That is 1000% the case with The Broken Earth trilogy. This series is so complex, so full of raw emotion, & so beautifully distinct from other books of this genre.The writing here is some of the most engrossing I've ever read in my life. Jemisin is equal parts artist & scientist with her eloquent prose & meticulously organized plot points. I always say that I struggle to stay engaged with Hard Sci-Fi. I don't know if these books should be classified as Hard Sci-Fi, as they don't drone on & on in bouts of irrelevant tech speak, but they're similar in that there are so many facets to the science.But where Hard Sci-Fi often strikes me as boring, this series had me solidly engaged. It seems almost as though it's morphed together a handful sub-genres under the SFF banner & created an umbrella all its own.The scope of this story makes me feel so small; it is so full of detail & history that I feel as though I'm reading about events that have actually played out in some far away universe. Something I really appreciate in a series is reread value. I have no doubt The Broken Earth is a series that will have more to reveal upon each read through.The wrap of to this series is devastating but also wonderfully appropriate & well-crafted. I believe with this concluding novel Jemisin has truly set herself apart, not just as an author, but also as a vital contributor to the direction in which Fantasy will evolve as time goes on. I can say no more than to read this series & take the journey for yourself, but I will caution you that you 
must have patience.
 Nothing is immediately clear, and this story takes its time revealing itself to you, but I promise it is more than worth it.Honored to have read this with the wonderful, beautiful, amazing Melanie ðŸ’œ and the sweet, adorable, darling Petrik! ðŸ’œThis review and other reviews of mine can be found on Book Nest!
