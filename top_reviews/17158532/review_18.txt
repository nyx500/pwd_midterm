‘Laurent of Vere. They say you’re frigid. They say you rebuff all your suitors, that no man has been good enough to prise your legs apart. I believe you thought it would be brutish and physical, and maybe a part of you even wanted it that way. But you and I both know that Damen does not make love like that. He took you slowly. He kissed you until you started to want it.’ Laurent said, ‘Don’t stop on my account.�� ‘You let him undress you. You let him put his hands on you. They say you hate Akielons, but you let one into your bed. You weren’t expecting what it felt like when he touched you. You weren’t expecting the weight of his body, how it felt to have his attention, to have him want you.’ ‘You left out the part near the end, when it was so good I let myself forget what he’d done.’

This book has completely shredded my heart and probably has ruined anything I attempt to read next.I want to thank whatever higher being made C.S. Pacat and this series possible. I'm obviously not going to talk about the plot because, spoilers. I’m just— [insert heavy keysmashing here] I can’t properly form my thoughts about this story through my EXTREMELY OVERLOADED EMOTIONS right now, so here, have some of my favorite quotes:

He said, into the stillness, ‘I think if I gave you my heart, you would treat it tenderly.'

------ *collapses*

‘When you make love to me like that, I can’t think.’ ‘Don’t think,’ said Damen. Damen saw the flickering change, the tension, as the words provoked an internal battle. Damen said, ‘Don’t think.’‘Don’t,’ said Laurent, ‘toy with me. I—have not the means to—defend against this.’‘I don’t toy with you.’ ‘I—’ ‘Don’t think,’ said Damen. ‘Kiss me,’ said Laurent. And then flushed, a rich colour. Don’t think, Damen had said, but Laurent couldn’t do that. Even to sit there after what he had said, he was fighting a battle in his head. The words hung awkwardly, a blurt, but Laurent didn’t take them back, he just waited, his body singing with tension. Instead of leaning in, Damen took Laurent’s hand, brought it towards himself, and kissed his palm, once.

------ **I’m choking someone halp**

After a moment, Laurent said, ‘He would have liked you.’ ‘Even after I started courting his little brother?’ said Damen carefully.

‘I would court you,’ said Damen, ‘with all the grace and courtesy that you deserve.’

----- fucK THERE’S SOMETHING IN MY EYE I’M SO DONEand even though the ending wasn't as bloody as I would have liked (what? I'm a prude who likes gore.) I couldn't have wished for a better ending for these two. 

One of the MOST BEAUTIFUL ROMANTIC AMAZING INSANE PERFECT SERIES I HAVE READ. I'm going to need everyone to read this. Read it. Read it to be stunned, to fall in love, to witness what an incredible series should be.
