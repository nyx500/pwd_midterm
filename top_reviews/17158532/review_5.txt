No rating. For now. Up until the 80% mark this was five stars all the way. But that ending...I feel like I should add more here, so I will. If I were forced to rate this now, based on the series as a whole, this would be a solid four stars. I guess what I'm saying is don't let this review concern you or keep you from reading these books. This ending is perfectly satisfactory. For most books. But after the level of brilliance in the second one in this series, it just can't compare. It was too neat. Too tidy. Too...bloodless. And that's why I'm having trouble rating it.
