Re-Read March 2019I was clearly asleep when i rated this book 4.5 stars. After the best giant buddy (re) read, i have seen the errors of my rating.Bumping it up to:7+++++++ STAN starsThis series is so good i can't even express how good it is.. I can't EVEN!!!!The Characterization and character development is out of this world.The story - every word written in this series has a meaning and a deeper meaning.The world building and everything else in this series.  The MC's - Damen and Laurent, they are the best MC's ever. BEST of the BESTEST!!And this is too cute.... Thank you so much; Elena, Hayley, Moony, Rosa, Teal and Xia for taking this journey with me. It was so much fun.*******************************************4.5 "Hello, Lover." StarsWhat more can I say other than, I enjoyed this series. Damen and Laurent were amazing characters I enjoyed their Journey from enemies to allies to lovers, the writing was flawless as usual. 
"I think if I gave you my heart, you would treat it tenderly"
 AwwwwLaurent and Damen are so opposite of each other yet they fit so perfect together, in this book they come together to take back their kingdoms and do it so well. I loved Laurent's mind how he thinks and works. Damien's patience and strength was amazing.The sex scenes were sensual and very engaging.. 
I’ve,’ said Damen, ‘never—’‘Nor have I,’ said Laurent. ‘You’d be my first.’‘As you’d be mine,’ he heard himself say.Laurent said, ‘I thought that in Akielos, a First Night was special.’‘For a slave it is,’ said Damen. ‘For a slave it means everything.’
I felt the ending was anticlimactic. I wanted more. I wanted the regent to suffer, tortured and left to rotthe Dexter way. Thank God there is a 30 page book epilogue.Overall this is a captivating series. Damen and Laurent.
