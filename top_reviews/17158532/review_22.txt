“I would court you, with all the grace and courtesy that you deserve.”  Story ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️For centuries wars were won this way - two countries fighting for one cause - to destroy their real enemies. War is caused by several things but the most common is the hunger for power. If you get a taste of it there is a craving, a longing that destroys your soul. It makes you ruthless, makes you lose your loyalty and makes you forget that there is something other than power - like family or love. Being betrayed by their own families Damen and Laurent understand that the only way to win this waris to fight together. But still there are secrets that were told and hate and love that is brooding between them. But even though they don’t know if they can trust each other they are sure of one thing and one thing only - they want to take their rightful places as Kings and let justice take place. But justice is hard to gain when there is distrust between two soon-to-be-kings. With every book I read in this series and with every review I write for these special books I always repeat myself: this book is full of betrayal, intrigues and lots and lots of emotions. You think: How can there be any more betrayals and intrigues? Isn’t it getting boring? Let me tell you one thing: this book is every other thing but certainly not boring. Definitely not boring. It’s exciting and holds the reader on edge because they never know what is coming next. Who’s going to die who’s going to betray who and what will happen next? I felt too many emotions and my heart was forced to take so many heartbreaks and still I’m so so satisfied and happy that I started and finished this series. It wasn’t perfect, but it wasn’t awful. It was a really really good story with great characters and a nice captivating writing. Character ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐���The first time I heard about this book one name was burned into my memory. Laurent. He was like a beautiful poisonous snake. When you see it the first time it’s beautiful, fascinating and elegant and so so dangerous. I was confused by my high interest in him even though I hate mean and brutal characters - but then after reading and getting to know him better I understood - behind that mask of a poisonous monster there was something deep something forced into the shadows of his character. Kindness, the seeking for justice and love. I was captivated by his complicated and twisted character and by his intriguing and fascinating mind. I really really liked him because every time you tried to force him into a role - he broke out of it. You thought of him as a villain? So he shows you contrary. In this whole series he was my absolute favorite character. Next to Damen of course. Damen my wonderful kindhearted king. He was never perfect but his character developed into something wonderfully human. He sought justice and showed loyalty even though he could’ve acted differently. He trusted his feelings when there was doubt and even though Laurent sometimes treated him horribly he still knew that this was the way Laurent protected himself. With words. He saw behind the facade and saw the man, the real human person behind it. And then he fell in love. And it was wonderful. I think the characters in this story are a real masterpiece. They’re twisted, complicated and you can never really place them right or predict their movements. To follow their adventure was exciting and I loved every minute of it. Relationships ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “I think if I gave your heart, you would treat it tenderly.”  If you ever start this series be warned that there are horrible heartbreaks and other feelings you will feel. Because this books won’t give you a break when you need it. It’ll destroy you only to force you back to your feet to show you something new and shocking. Something you couldn’t even predict if you tried really really hard. And with forcing to go through all these heartbreaks my heart began to be vulnerable. All these betrayals, intrigues and plot twist. There was no time for a break - until my ship finally sailed I saw something I craved so much - happiness. Pure innocent happiness. And then I wasn’t vulnerable or angry or sad anymore - I was grinning like and idiot and being a happy little reader. This one is a really complicated love story where you can never be sure of anything. Writing style ⭐️⭐️⭐️Even though I loved the story and the characters, I think this book has a little weakness: it’s really character driven. It gave the whole story a little bit of a slow pacing. I know some of you like character driven stories, but I would’ve liked a nice balance of story and characters. Still it’s one of my favorite stories involving wonderful princes that love each other. I’m really happy I started and finished it and maybe in a few months or years I’ll reread it in German. “A kingdom, or this”
