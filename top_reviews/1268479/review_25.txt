Enjoyed this a lot. One thing I admire about this author is his dedication to world-building. This is the third world I've read by him where he's invented a new type of magic system that is fresh and interesting. It takes a lot of road-paving to get something this unique through to the audience, and the beginning is a bit slow because of it, but I really enjoyed the characters and the magic system. Like most of the other reviews I agree the ending felt a bit rushed, and the sequel was set up in a bit awkward way. I will be eagerly awaiting the next book, because the characters are quite interesting and the world deserves more exploration. The whole "god" aspect was also quite refreshing and new. Solid 4 stars.
