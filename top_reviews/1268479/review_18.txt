“A person knows when they’re in darkness, even when they can’t see. -Nightblood”In Warbreaker, Brandon Sanderson gives readers imaginative epic fantasy world-building along with a good story (what one generally comes to expect from Sanderson and which he consistently delivers on). I enjoyed the story of the two heroines, Vivenna and Siri. In the face of impending war with Hallendron, they are forced to take on new and unexpected roles, both for their own survival, as well as the survival of their kingdom. While I enjoyed Warbreaker, the middle suffered a bit. After Sanderson established the premise and plotlines, there seemed to be some fairly long sections which didn't really add much. That said, I've been enjoying Sanderson's characters and worlds, and find Sanderson to be a really good story-teller.
