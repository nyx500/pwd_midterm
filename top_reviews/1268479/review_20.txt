“Unknowing ignorance is preferable to informed stupidity.” 

I have read many of Sanderson’s books (+10) and I think the man is a genius when it comes to world building and magic systems. To be honest, this is different from what I expected but this is not necessarily a bad thing.The main characters in this series were well written, once again Sanderson goes for the kickass female protagonist which I usually like but in this book I found myself leaning toward the male characters. Susebron the God King; which has a great character growth story the story, Lightsong, reluctant god of bravery, hilarious as fuck and my favorite in the book and finally Vasher and his mysterious sword. Siri and Vivenna were definitely good too but I just found the males to be more interesting.The world building is good, I mean Sanderson wrote this. I expected something different when I kept hearing about a magic system involving colors, something more complex and hard. I thought different colors were gonna give different abilities or something like that but the system revolves more around breath, each individual has one breath and when people get more, they get certain other abilities. Colors were there too specially when it comes to Awakening of solid objects. There are great artworks of scenes in the books that makes me want to re-read it already!Now the book is very very slow, I think it is the slowest thing I ever read by Sanderson and it kind of lacks the action I was seeking which makes it not suitable for everyone. I think the book needs a lot of patience as most of the epicness happen in the last 10% and this is a huge book (almost 700 pages). I think it is important to know this when going into the book because otherwise it may be a boring experience. But here is the thing, I found the world mythology and philosophy to be entertaining and it kind of compensated the lack of action. Sanderson also usually involves religion one way or another into his books and I find it fascinating!! 

“You see, the great thing about madness is that it’s all in your head.” 

Summary: I think Warbreaker is a good book but it needs patience. It is very unique with its slowness, magical system and world building. The characters make it a worthy read though. The book ends up like a standalone but with an obvious link to a second book. I don’t think we will see that second book soon but I know I will be reading it when it comes out!
