Check out my new youtube channel where I show my instant reactions to reading fantasy books seconds after I finish the book.
One of Sanderson's weaker booksWhile I appreciate the world that Sanderson has built here for Warbreaker, and his truly innovative magic system -- I just can't recommend this book like I can for his other amazing works.The ending was classic Sanderson with a very clever way to bring everything together that was long foreshadowed (but not realized by me until the end), but things felt rushed at the end and I couldn't connect with the characters like I normally can with him.I think Sanderson is at his best when he is working with a longer series, as this book shared a lot of the same problems that Elantris had.Read this if you are really into Sanderson and have finished his other books, but I absolutely would not use this book as an entry into his works.
