In Dragonsigner Menolly finds herself at the Harper Hall. Beyond her wildest dreams and all the obstacles placed by her family, she's ready to a new new life doing what she loves - making music. Unfortunately, life in the Hall isn't all she'd hoped. Her possession of nine fire lizards doesn't make her popular with some, and like most novels of this type, Menolly finds herself dealing with the "mean girl" contingent. She has instructors who don't think it's worth their time to train "a girl", especially when said girl actually knows a lot, thanks to training by Petiron, Half Circle Sea Hold's elderly Harper (and Robinton's father) and is actually talented. She makes friends with the irrepressible Piemur and begins a lifelong platonic love with Masterharper Robinton. As she slowly grows into her craft, Menolly becomes aware that her very presence is a part of the changing of attitudes on Pern.Given time and age, I would have loved for Menolly to have Menolly have more close female friends her age, though given her past it makes sense that she doesnt. Sure there's Mirrim (who really really needs her own series) and Audiva, one of the girls who stays in the cot. Yes, Menolly is incredibly talented, and she doesn't realize the extent of her talent, but I never thought she crossed into "Mary Sue" territory. However, so what? Fantasy is full of male Gary Stus who've been given a pass just because they're the heroes. I'm perfectly fine with heroines who are GOOD at what they do and aren't willing to dumb themselves down or hide their gifts. And yes, the fire lizards. I still want a fire lizard. Preferably a bronze or a blue.I also have a soft spot for Masterharper Robinton. Fight me.
