Book 2 in the the Harper Hall series, and book 4 in the Pern series.The story of Mellony continues as she is brought to Harper Hall, to start her path of becoming a Harper. Still not sure of herself, still wondering if she truly belongs there, Mellony embarks on the journey that will change her life. It is hard enough making friends, but she has the roost of 9 fire lizards following her around, and a lot of folk are still leery of the little cousin of the dragons.There are some great new characters, one particular I liked, Piemur, who becomes Mellony's friend and confident. The next book appears to highlight him and I am looking forward to it.A great light series I am glad I stumbled on.
