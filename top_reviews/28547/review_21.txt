A lovely focus on Menolly, her growth in self-esteem and confidence as she discovers there are people in the world who are honest and supportive. This, despite those who bully and gossip and are outright mean. Piemur, and of course Master Robinton are also present, as is Camo and Sebell.This will end my Pern reading for this year. There is more Anne McCaffrey to read, but am saving it for next year.
