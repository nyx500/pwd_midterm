Overall impression is one big disappointment.The whole trilogy left a feeling of the bloated fourth volume of The Farseer Trilogy where all loose ends are being tied up. Although, it is done very ungratefully.!!!WARNING!!! SPOILERSFitz & Molly reunion plus 7 kids bonus is very artificial and out of context. 16 Years is not 16 months. They would be totally different people regardless of what happened within this period. Let alone vast life experience that affected both of them.Fool...my personal disappointment here. I hoped that Fitz is going to realise that Fool is a woman and They Live Happily Ever After with a sense of wonder about each other and respect and exciting life...On top of this the usual numerous repetitions of what happened only a hundred pages before.The Tawny Man trilogy is a let down.Hobb was at the top 5 of my favourite writers since 2002, it is very sad to lose her now.
