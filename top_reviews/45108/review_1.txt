Fool's Fate (Realm of Elderlings #9 Tawny Man #3)This is a wonderful end to The Tawny Man trilogy. It's a great story with lots of interesting twists and turns. I would highly recommend all of Robin Hobb's books. Great read. Begin with the Farseer Trilogy and get the whole story.
Ours was a ragged and uneven parting. Each of us had intended to see the other again.
