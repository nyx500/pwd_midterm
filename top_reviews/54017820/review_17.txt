4.5 stars! This book was so intriguing and enchanting! The world that the author created is so unique: it has gods, monsters, princes, curses and more. I really liked Vanja, she’s the definition of a morally gray character. Vanja is very brave but she’s also a thief. I really liked Emeric he’s very sweet and smart. My favorite character was Ragne, she’s so loyal and kind! The enemies-to-lovers romance was *chief’s kiss*. I love that the book included LGBTQ+ representation! I loved that the book included German fairy tales!
