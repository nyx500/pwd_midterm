I have so many thoughts and feelings about this book, all of them fully agreeing that this is the best book I have read all year. As soon as I read the end of the first chapter, I got that 'holy shit, this is a five star book' feeling, which I've not felt for many, many months.This is such an unapologetically Queer, diverse, book - without ever making it's Queer characters feel Other alongside cis, allo, straight citizens. Everyone is equal here, and it never feels like the Queer characters are written in just to tick a diversity box. Our main character and love interest seem to be demisexual, and another main character is a lesbian in a sapphic relationship.This is beautifully written, and hilarious too. Vanja became a new favourite of mine as soon as she started drawing butts on the carriage window. And finding a way to invent texting in a fantasy world is sheer genius? Every character is witty, sarcastic and so much fun to be around, I'm hoping we at least get a spin off because I need more from this world.
