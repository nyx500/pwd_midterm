Re-read June 2023: YEP! This remains one of the best books I’ve ever read. I’m emotional. Also I can’t believe I didn’t mention in my original review that this book is hilarious because the humor is a massive part of the charm, it’s outrageously, laugh-out-loud funny.  I love this book. So much. Little Thieves is bitter and sweet and sad and happy and wholesome and frustrating and thrilling and basically what I'm saying is that I ran the gamut of emotions with this book. I tend to feel weird giving reviews for books I LOVE because I so enjoy going into a good book completely blind and I don't want to give anyone else hints of what they might see, but rest assured this book is everything. Beautiful writing, a variety of characters, plot twists and turns, GROWTH, and magic. What more could I ask for?I cannot wait for the official release in October so I can physically hold this book in my hands, because I know this is one I'll come back to more than once.
