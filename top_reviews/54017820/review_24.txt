~ reread may 2023deciding to reread this might be one of my top decisions of the year so far. I adore this book with my entire being and it was just as funny, witty, exciting and brilliant the second time around. ~ first read November 2021the characters, the wit, the snark, the pining, the action, the painful yet wonderfully slow burn romance I LOVED IT ALL.* vanja has without a doubt one of the most charming and addictive voices I’ve read from in a long time. she’s witty, fierce, vulnerable and a total softie. * the slow burn romance was EVERYTHING I could have ever asked for in a slow burn romance. * the dialogue was brilliantly, genuinely made me laugh out loud, funny.* the plot was fast paced, easy to follow and beyond entertaining. * the cast of characters were endearing, fully developed and their individual relationships and complexities were wonderful. * the casual lgbtqia+ rep was fab and I loved the way vanja and emeric’s relationship reflected their identity as demisexual/romantic. this whole book was a riot and utter delight from start to finish and I would read happily anything from vanja’s perspective in a heartbeat.TW: talk of sexual assault
