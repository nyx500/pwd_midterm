is this manon’s hair?nah okay so then why is everything white and straight 😭my thoughts on this book:✧ bryce & hunt are stale asf. i loved them in the first book and their character development was really good and now it’s like sjm thinks she can just stop writing them well because they already had enough character development in the previous book. well, that’s not how it works. they are boring now and all they do is talk about having sex. their relationship is bland and i don’t even ship them anymore. i liked them in hoeab because they were friends first and then slowly grew to trust each other and be one another’s safe space and now they’re just oH sO pOWERfuL royalty bitches. they’re not an interesting couple, they have no chemistry or individual character development or relationship development and i don’t like how hunt is all possessive alpha male bullshit ok byesjm thinks she can make it okay that hunt is a bitchy protective asshole by bryce making fun of him for it, but that’s still his personality and i hate it. sjm if you actually believe that bryce can handle herself and doesn’t need an “alphahole” as you call it, (corny-ass name but whatever,) then make it so. ⚠︎︎spoiler⚠︎︎ also: bryce doesn’t need to be a princess with 10388373 magical powers to be a badass, so fucking leave her alone sjm. ✧ this world building sucks. nothing is ever explained. here i was thinking that this took place in only one city?? i don’t understand anything. there are a bunch of random terms and things thrown in here to make a plot and they are never explained whatsoever. sjm continually has to explain what’s going on to us because i don’t think she understands her own story all that well, but half of the things she mentions aren’t ever explained and i’m just left here to fend for myself.i liked the whole urban fantasy aspect of the first book, how it felt like an actual city and there was an atmosphere to it, but in this book i didn’t get any of that at all because the characters were constantly running around doing random shit in ‘realms’ that shouldn’t even exist smh✧ since every single person whose pov we get in this book is straight as a board, i’ll make a list of characters i was shipping that i have evidence for that have a 99.99% chance of not being canon because sjm won’t make any of her main characters diverse. ♥︎ hunt x baxian (OKAY WHEN THEY WERE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES TOGETHER YALL CANT TELL ME THAT WAS PLATONIC) (literally #1 ship in this book xoxo)♥︎ hunt x ruhn (brother in law romance 😍) (anyway how ruhn continuously warms up to hunt bEcAusE hEs wItH bRyCe mhm sure keep telling yourself that)♥︎ tharion x ithan (these two did so much running around investigating together)♥︎ ruhn x ithan (didn’t ruhn invite ithan to live with him or was that someone else)♥︎ cormac x tharion (CORMAC LITERALLY DID SOME SELF SACRIFICING BULLSHIT FOR THARION DONT TELL ME THEYRE NOT MADLY IN LOVE)♥︎ literally everyone in the group of cormac, tharion, ithan, ruhn, hunt (except for cormac and ruhn obviously because they’re cousins)♥︎ bryce x danika (dont fucking tell me they were jUst fRieNds)♥︎ the hind x the viper queen (LISTEN i know these two have probably never met but IMAGINE THE TENSION)♥︎ danika x sophie (they were doomed lovers)✧ SOMEBODY TAKE - AND … AWAY FROM SJMSHE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED you’d think after more than 10 books she would improve her writing style but nope. in this books she used almost word for word sentences from acomaf 😭 please she’s plagiarizing her own series 💀💀✧ “you’re a princess 👸🏻 YOURE a princess 😍 EVERYONES A PRINCESS ✨you have magical powers 💥 and YOU have magical 🧙‍♀️ powers ⚡️ EVERYONE has magical powers 🪄”it gets tiring, i’ll tell you that.⚠︎︎spoilers⚠︎︎ i liked it better when bryce was a messy person who had everyone see her as a shallow party girl so that they wouldn’t see the hurt inside her from losing her best friend (lover) ✧ the plot is so far gone at this point.all of the things i said previously about the world building also apply to the plot. it doesn’t make sense and it’s trying to make us “surprised” every time something happens even though nothing is surprising at this point because so much random stuff is going on and apparently absolutely anything is possible. it seems like we’re focusing on one thing and then we’ll abruptly move to something else and the whole thing is just really confusing. there’s also way too much running around trying to fiGuRe sTufF out, like why do y’all even care about what’s going on with the rEbeLLioN anyway it has basically nothing to do with you 😐like is this harry potter or something y’all are acting like 12 year olds ✧ has anyone noticed how many male characters there are in relation to the number of female characters?there are about 6 different male characters whose pov we get and one (1) female character. and OF COURSE everyone oversexualizes her and seventy five percent of the male characters are in love with her.one of the male characters (who calls her Legs) says at one point, “it’s bryce. everyone has a thing for her.” like ok is she just here to be sexualized by everyone now or what (and i love that she owns her sexuality but it’s kinda gross seeing all these male povs talk about how hot she is etc etc it just feels very male gaze-y and we don’t like objectification of women)✧ the sex scenes that everyone thinks are “sooooo hot” for some reason are underwhelming asf.it’s literally not hot to start talking about stars and oceans in the middle of a smut scene. i literally don’t understand. sjm does that in every single one of her books like why do you have to bring magic into it??and fire???and snow??like “the stars swam around us… the oceans rose and the golden dust on our planet lifted up to brush against our souls. the leaves on the trees fell and the wind… the wind swept us together until our magic fused together and-and we were flying, with galaxies swirling- and our power becoming… becoming one.” there will be something like that right in the middle of a smut scene. like sweetie 😐 that’s 😐 not hot 😐but good for y’all who have mountains shaking at you while you’re having sex✧ okay i DID like the night & day thing sue me i knew who day was the whole time but i SIMP for that character so idec 😩🤚ruhn seems like one of the more decent men in this series and he has pretty good character development so i actually didn’t mind reading about him. his relationship with day was a little bit insta love but they also had chemistry so it worked ig. the whole reveal was pretty great too even though i already knew who day was (i read spoilers and read the ends of books first because i have no self control ha)for the most part i support that ship and they’re a lot better than watching bryce and hunt try to be sexy when they are actually just stale 💀✧ i really don’t like how all the ‘males’ growl and are all protective of the ‘females’ like stfu it just gives me icky vibes and since bryce even knows she doesn’t want hunt and other guys acting like that and she even tells them so, and they act like that anyways and she just accepts it and has to deal with them i didn’t like the message that gives at all. like if she was on her own she could be much freer and do what she wants more. it helps a little that bryce also gets protective over hunt sometimes but it’s not really the same and i still feel like alot of the ways sjm writes these things gives sexist vibes.maybe this is just personal preference because i don’t at all like protective male characters in my books but i’m just sick of couples and male characters being written like that.✧ even if i don’t feel like most of sjm’s characters are written well at all, here are the ones i simp for:❥ lidia❥ fury❥ ruhn❥ the viper queen❥ aidas ❥ danika❥ celestinaok wow there are a lot of hot people i won’t lieanyways putting myself through 800 pages of this mess was worth it to write this review because i am honestly having so much fun ahahahsjdjdj☞︎ also i might be done with sjm but some of y’all aren’t ready for that conversation bc she’s basically just doing fan service at this pointher latest few books (see: acosf and hosab) have been literally the shittiest quality ever and she still doesn’t know how to include important characters that are anything other than white & cishet - like honey you gladly write all of the most far-fetched fanfic type shit and publish it in your books just because your fans want you to but you won’t make the effort to include better representation in your books? do better🤡
