#1 House of Earth and Blood ‚Äî 3.5 starsWHAT IN THE NAME OF CROSSOVER INSANITY SATANS TIT IS THISüò©‚ú∑ to Hel with me banking on this book to be better than the previous installment cause this was a downgrade. i was bored through most of it, and finishing it had felt like a chore.‚ú∑ although... i feel like this was dull in a way that the next book would get good and exciting again since the stakes are higher now. but who knows, we‚Äôll probably have to wait another two years to find out. should i quit while im ahead?‚ú∑ (spoiler) i had guessed that Day was Lidia, but that last chapter i really did not see coming. when i said ‚Äúi needed SJM to pull a Rhysand,‚Äù i didnt mean LITERALLY. üíÄ does that mean Bryce is in Velaris now?‚ú∑ we‚Äôve managed to go without any ‚Äúmates‚Äù business in book 1, but now so many of them (couple/pairing plot twists) were dropped like bombs in this book. the romance was done very poorly. how did SJM go from Aelin/Rowan, Elide/Lorcan, and Feyre/Rhys to this crap?‚ú∑ (spoiler) Ruhn & Lidia, i didnt hate the idea of them, but wow the instalove had me wanting to barf. üôÑ though now that they know each others true identity, maybe there‚Äôll be more tension between them in book 3.‚ú∑ Bryce & Hunt seriously? am i the only one who couldnt feel the connection/passion between them? theyre better off as friends. also, the smut. from none (book 1) to... how many scenes in this book? idk what to say. and they werent that titillating either.‚ú∑ im so disappointed Aidas didnt even make an appearance in this book. he was mentioned and impersonated, but no signs of the Prince of the Chasm. :( would it be foolish to hold out hope for him & Bryce? especially after what happened with Bryce & Hunt.‚ú∑ idk if its me no longer being a teenager who adored SJMs books, but so far im finding this series is even worse than TOG & ACOTAR. especially, the writing and the romance.
