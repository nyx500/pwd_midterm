no. noo. NO SHE FUCJING DIDN'T BC THAT ENDING!!!!????!!she did not. BUT SHE DID. actually, im-.....s c r e a m sthe way this book did NOT need to be 800 fucking pages.....literally half of this book is all detective work and finding out that the people you think you know and love *gasp* are not who you think they are?!?! consider me shocked. anyways...this was an enjoyable mess but i would say the stakes in the first book sounded better and played out wayyy more extreme and intriguing than here in this book....aside from the last 30 pages because uh....if you know, you knowwwwwww!!!!but...the smirking, hissing, giggling, and purring that amounts in this sequel?
