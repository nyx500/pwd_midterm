“You're a power player now, Bryce, wether you like it or not.”

This book takes place a few months after the end of HOEAB. Bryce is trying to adapt to her new reality as the Princess of Fae, while also trying to work things out with Hunt and build a steady and serious relationship. Hunt is enjoying his newfound freedom and Ruhn is building back the trust between his sister and him. That is until the whole group gets sucked into a research/rescue mission involving some rebels and ruthless and cruel faes that will not hesitate to destroy them all should their affiliation with rebels be revealed.

"You'd almost think this was planned by the gods. They probably have a special task force: How to Fuck Over Bryce and Hunt in One Day."

The plot is as good as in the first book, and it is full of unexpected twists and shocking revelations. My heart was pounding and I had to refrain from skimming parts of the book because I was so anxious to know what would happen, but at the same time, I wanted to take my time and savor this book... Conflicted emotions and a few heart attacks apart though, it is a GREAT book and there are many details that are included in the first book that actually have a big significance in this book. There are also some easter eggs and an amazing "wait-what-how-am-I-supposed-to-wait-for-the-next-book-now?" ending.

"Our insurance rates will go sky-high," Ruhn said to Declan, appealing to the slightly-less-insane of his roommates."When the fuck did you become a grown-up?" Flynn barked.Ithan jerked his own chin toward the doorway again. "Wait to have your meltdown until after you meet the fourth new roommate.""You're part of the Quinlan-Silago clan now. We're a crazy bunch, but we love each other."

I LOVE the characters in this book, THEY ARE SO CUTE AND PERFECT TOGETHER. SJM worked her magic once again and made me fall in love with them as I did fall in love with the crew of ACOTAR and TOG. The side characters are as lovable and amazing as the main characters. The friendship developing between the guys in this book is so cute and wholesome! Ruhn, Flynn, Declan, Tharion, Hunt, and even Ithan are becoming a cute little boy's club and my heart is SO happy about that. I wanted more of Ithan and Tharion and I got it! Hypaxia is also more present in this book and I can already see that Bryce and her will make a kickass duo.

She sipped from her champagne, then said casually to Hunt, "The headline on the gossip sites tomorrow is going to be: Horndog Umbra Mortis gropes Starborn Princess at Ballet.""Good," Hunt murmured. "It'll improve my standing in the 33rd.""You know what I mean," Bryce said."I'm not sure I do." Had his voice dropped lower?"We're roomies," she said, her own voice getting breathy."Roomies.""Occasional Beer Pong Champion?"Hunt snatched the hat off her head and plunked it back on his own, backward as usual, "Yes, the Autumn King truly fears our unholy beer pong alliance."

 The romance between Bryce and Hunt is still super cute, and we also have more spicy moments, even though SJM did ensure that Hunt got cockblocked quite a few times before *it* finally happened. They are cute and funny and they still have that witty banter from the first book that I enjoyed so much.

"If you're looking for How Not to Be an Asshole, it's shelved between Bye, Loser and Get the Fuck Out."

New characters also get introduced in this book, some likable, some less likable, but it was nice to have a few new people to love or hate. Some of them I'm still not 100% sure about, but it's normal, SJM still needs a few bombs to drop on us in the next book.

“Hel’s armies shall strike at your command, Bryce Quinlan.”

I am a little disappointed though that Aidas was not more present in this book. I really like him, and I think he has the potential to be a truly complex and interesting morally grey character, but we haven't seen enough of him to really know what he is up to and where he stands in the conflict that is to come.I can't wait for the next book. There is SO MUCH potential for an even more epic third book. 😭😭😭😭😭

Hunt’s voice was a thunderclap as he said behind her, “Light it up, Bryce.”
