This is the 5th Percy Jackson book I've read to my daughter Celyn. It's half-term and we've not had many carers (Celyn is very disabled and gets respite care) so we've had a chance to finish the book off.As always Celyn has supplied the rating and left the review to me.The concluding (well - we could go to book 4.5 & 5.5) volume of the Percy Jackson series continues in the same vein as the previous volumes, though with an added sense of danger and sadness as named/known campers are killed and even PJ himself may be up for the chop.We've followed Percy from a lad of 11-ish to his 16th birthday, so girlfriends are up for debate too and both Rachel and Annabeth are in the frame.The Greek pantheon are a great choice for these sort of books as even in the oldest of writings there's very little about them that's godly except for their power. Their pettiness and bickering provide endless opportunities for conflict and plotting even without the resurgence of their titanic forebears.The final battle is a colossal affair that occupies most of the book. The variety of monsters and weapons keep the thing from getting repetitive and I had a good time reading it. The ending is satisfying with elements of tragedy mixed into the victory. Job well done.Riordan not only draws on the myths for monsters, gods, demigods, heroes, and bits of plot in overt ways but also in unacknowledged ways that are fun for those who have read the source material. For example, the incident from the Trojan war with Achilles and Patroclus is played out in a similar manner at one point by two female characters.The only question now is what to read next?
