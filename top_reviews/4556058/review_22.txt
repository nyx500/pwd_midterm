THE MINI REVIEW IS POSTED  So actually I have finished reading this book a week ago but I just have the time to write the review today ( okay, I'm lying, I was just being lazy hahaha üòÇ ) I read this book while I was in reading slump and IT WAS THE WORST READING SLUMP I HAVE EVER BEEN IN. IT LAST FOR A FEW WEEKS. I swear those days when I was in reading slump, I felt hollow, empty and I didn't know what to do and I was frustrated a bit for not being able to read like I usually did and thank God, this book was the book which got me out of my slump. When I read this book, I didn't feel excited or surprised or anything even when I didn't expect something to happen but it wasn't a bad read either. It was pretty fun but I honestly didn't feel anything and LET'S BLAME THAT TO THE READING SLUMP. Reading slump sucks! This series isn't my favorite but and my favorite book in this series is just the first book because it was so amazing and I loved it but the next books were just okay. Honestly, I continued reading this series because of the writing style. It was so good and hilarious! I loved it. Overall, I quite enjoyed reading this book even though I didn't feel any kind of emotions while reading it and this book got me out of my slump, so YAY! Thank you for reading and liking this review. I appreciate it so much, guys! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢*sighs*I'm in reading slump and I seriously need a book that can help me to get out of my reading slump.
