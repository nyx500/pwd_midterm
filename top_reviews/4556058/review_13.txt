Watching the Olympus, the eternal city, shining above the empire states building.every times, every books.& it always looks the same.Why I love Percy (or main Heroes in general); because He (they) knew this dangerous plan needed to be done, even though he was afraid. He knew his friends look at him as the leader, waited for his plan, & he couldn't show his fear or weakness. He should inspire them & give them hope.he is afraid, like any normal human, but he had the courage to do it, to move forward.I really admired that.This book was full of events that made me nervous, scared & excited at the same time. Sometimes, these feelings were coming along with crying. when I didn't expect to cry! like Selina's death or Leneus's or Michael Yew's falling, or seeing someone from cabin Apollo covered in a golden burial shroud. I mean I even didn't know these guys, they just came in this book (well, except Leneus who was a jerk before too) yet I cried.a battlefield between good & evil; heroes & villains, trusting & temptationsCo-operation in defending what is right in an epic battle, the last battleonly these heroes can defend the whole human civilization from destructionthis book is Dark; the way I love.So much Laughstill so much Cry!& we have funny moments because of Percy's narration.such a beautiful & exciting ending-Plot: ★★★★★/5/Excitements: ★★★★★/5/Feelz: ★★★★★/5Characters developments: ★★★★★/5Written style: ★★★★★/5/HUMOR!: ★★★★★/5World building: ★★★★★/5General idea: ★★★★★/5
