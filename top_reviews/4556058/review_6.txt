"God of medicine, at your service.""Follow that pig!"It is chaos, chaos, and then more chaos. Final journey of Percy Jackson is ready to reveal itself, where all those seemingly loose ends are about to come together. The Last Olympian arrives with fully battle-prepped Percy Jackson, along with rest of the gang."With great power... comes great need to take a nap."We enter full-battle-mode right off the bat with Titan army pounding everyone in their path. Though this battle has been a long time coming, Rick Riordan does not come up short in his ability to introduce entertaining twists all over the place. We have a series of battles with this last book, and almost all of the latter half of the book is devoted to a thoroughly enjoyable final battle. Disappointment, defeat, heartbreak and death are what we have to except for the majority of the story, but, as always, a way to a thrilling ending is paved beautifully. And the author is not done with the twists, even until the last couple of chapters. And the ending: it was the best!"A half-blood of the eldest dogs...""er, Percy? That's gods. Not dogs.""Oh, right,"Although now I'm depressed that I'm at the end, I had the most amazing time with Percy Jackson and the Olympians. First two books were good, but it was the third (The Titan's Curse) that made me fall in love with the series. And the fourth (The Battle of the Labyrinth) gave one of the best adventure stories I've ever read, which, for me, is going to keep the favorite-of-series spot. True, final book was more eventful, but The Battle of the Labyrinth is just pure adventure. And finally, it would be remiss of me if I didn't mention how well-written each book was. Everything was so consistent, easy to read, and beautifully organized. I think I'll be able to read entire series many times over in future with never getting tired of it. Oh, if only there were a couple of more books..."Some day soon, I am going to make Pegasus soup."
