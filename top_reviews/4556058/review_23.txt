THE LAST BOOK IN MY FAVORITE SERIES. I was a sobbing mess after reading this book not because the ending was sad, but because I was sad because it was ending. I know a whole new series exist but I couldn’t bring myself to complete the first book of that series (because wasn’t there). But let's not talk about this. Let's talk about how a masterpiece written by our great teacher Uncle Rick- someone who taught me that Greek mythology is very interesting and most of the things I know of Greek mythology is because of him- ended. Highlights of this book:  die (nothing new), Percy dreams a lot, Percy gets betrayed, Percy gets kissed by *wink* ____, Percy nearly dies (nothing new again), Percy gets threatened by her future mother in law *wink*.The Percy Jackson and the Olympians series might be the most relatable series you'll ever read. Just look at the conversation between the characters (these conversations are from the entire series just to make everyone who's read this series feel nostalgic):1. “Let us find the dam snack bar” Zoë said. “We should eat while we can”Grover cracked a smile. "The dam snack bar?"Zoë blinked. "Yes. What is funny?""Nothing," Grover said, trying to keep a straight face. "I could use some dam french fries."Even Thalia smiled at that. "And I need to use the dam restroom."......I started cracking up, and Thalia and Grover joined in, while Zoë just looked at me. "I do not understand.""I want to use the dam water fountain," Grover said."And..." Thalia tried to catch her breath. "I want to buy a dam t-shirt.”2. “Deadlines just aren’t real to me until I’m staring one in the face.”3. “With great power…comes great need to take a nap. Wake me up later.”4. “I’m calm,” Rachel insisted. “Every time I’m around you, some monsters attack us. What’s to be nervous about?”“Look,” I said. “I’m sorry about the band room. I hope they didn’t kick you our or anything.”“Nah. They asked me a lot of questions about you. I played dumb.”“Was it hard?” Annabeth asked. 5. "Ever come home and found your room messed up? Like some helpful person (hi, Mom) has tried to “clean” it, and suddenly you can’t find anything? And even if nothing is missing, you get that creepy feeling like somebody’s been looking through your private stuff and dusting everything with lemon furniture polish?"6. "Grover was sniffing the wind, looking nervous. He fished out his acorns and threw them into the sand, then played his pipes. They rearranged themselves in a pattern that made no sense to me, but Grover looked concerned."That's us," he said. "Those five nuts right there.""Which one is me?" I asked."The little deformed one," Zoe suggested."Oh, shut up."7. “But I've never even been to Olympus! Zeus is crazy!"Chiron and Grover glanced nervously at the sky. The clouds didn't seem to be parting around us, as Grover had promised. They were rolling straight over our valley, sealing us in like a coffin lid.Er, Percy ...?" Grover said. "We don't use the c-word to describe the Lord of the Sky.”8. “My brother broke into a toothy grin. "Yay! Your brain works!” At last I would like to say:1. I love this series.2. I love Nico.3. I love Percabeth.4. I don't give a shit about Rachel. Girl just stay away from Percy.5. I really regret L___'s death. I couldn't bring myself to hate him.6. Some greek gods are stupid not that bad.__________________________________________________
