The art style in Saga never fails to impress me. This was a really entertaining volume!
“After years of pitched battles, my father was ready for a significantly less stressful career. Unfortunately, he decided to try raising a girl.”
Marko and Alana are always fun protagonists to follow, especially when paired with intergalactic warfare and mutant creatures around every corner. In this instalment the pair are on a mission to find their idol, who may also be able to assist them greatly.While the plot didn’t progress as much as I would have liked this volume, the characters did undergo a good amount of development. There were several twists that left me completely shocked, which made for a quick reading experience. An overall great addition to the series!
