In volume three of the Saga series, we add to the mix two tabloid writers, Upsher and Doff, who aspire to dish on the outrageous story of a Wreath and Landfall coupling that has produced a LOVECHILD. By which I MEAN: A Wreath guard (our Alana) falls for her Landfall prisoner (Marko), and they run off together! And make a baby?! Wow, dear readers! So, yeah, this is more comic stuff to help balance out the pathos. Then Our Gang (with Marko’s Mom) (chased by The Will and Lying Cat and Gwendolyn and Price Robot IV, all intent on killing M and A) heads off to see Marko and Alana’s fave author in the Multiverse, S. Oswald Heist, who wrote their fave book, A Night Time Smoke, with its steamy cover depicting what would seem to be paranormal sex between a human and a monster. Some people think this is a thinly disguised treatise advocating pacifism. *I like it that every scene, every altercation, involves one of them holding baby Hazel. What’s the alternative?! I mean, sometimes refugees need to carry babies through war zones. I like how this centrality of Hazel underlines the dark absurdity and tragedy of subjecting children to war.*Something made me uncomfortable about calling the six year rescued by The Will from the brothel “Slave Girl;” it objectifies her and sort of makes light of her plight. So I was glad when The Will names her Sophie. He (and Gwendolyn) are taking care of her. And you know, post-The Wraith, The Will is into Gwendolyn; could they have a life together?*Marko is a pacifist, or intends to be, but he is constantly facing situations with his new family where he must consider violence as a way of protecting them. *I love every scene in this volume with Heist and Marko’s mother. I also love The Wraith (the ghost babysitter!)
