Just your typical story about a couple from opposing species of an interstellar war falling in love and having a baby, then fleeing the governments and hired mercenaries of both sides in a wooden rocketship with their ghost babysitter...Three volumes in and so far each one has been 5 stars. I'm pretty sure that has never happened to me before.
