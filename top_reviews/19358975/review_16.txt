“No story’s worth dying for" This review contains *spoilers*.This series is going by so quickly. I want to reach the last volume, but I also don’t want this to be over (I’ll probably read it anyway). I’m just really attached to the wonderful characters in this comic book.The fast paced plot, the funny dialogue, and the incredible relationships all make it impossible to put down. It's a completely unputdownable story.And so much happened in that last chapter, I’m still trying to wrap my mind around it. I can’t believe Gwendolyn killed D. Oswald Heist, we just got to know him. I truly can’t get over how great this comic book is. I’m definitely not ready for it to end.Also, I loved watching Hazel slowly grow.  So cute.
