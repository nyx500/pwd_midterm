These books are like Prozac..I just want to eat them up by the dozen.I think this one is even better than Volume 2. (Yes, I still haven't gotten vol. 1 yet)Our heroes Marco and Alana have gone to find their literary hero so that they can ask him questions about the book that caused them to become a couple.

Then--stuff happens

I wants all these books!!
