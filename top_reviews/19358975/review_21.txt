“break rules as often as you can, because who the hell doesn’t want to have an adventure?” oh, how i’ve missed saga! after loving the previous two volumes so much, however, this one fell a little flat for me plot-wise. it was still super hilarious and incredibly heart-wrenching back to back and i laughed and yelled out loud a few times, but this particular volume felt like a kind of filler for what’s to come in volume 4, i guess.i loved the character developments in this one though, especially in regard to sophie, gwendolyn and klara! and that one scene of sophie with the lying cat in the park in which she introduces herself and he shushes her MY HEART IS SO FULL I LOVE HER SO MUCH!!!
