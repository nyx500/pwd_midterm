Yeah, a little bit. It’s also the best book in the history of ever. Sure it has a little kissing

but it also has pirates

and bad guys

and swordsmen

and giants

and R.O.U.S.es

I’m not writing a synopsis. I’m not writing a review. I’m just telling you if you have not already read it, read it now. You ask: “What if I don’t like it????” INCONCEIVABLE!

If you read it, hate it, and have the desire to 1 Star it or say bad things, you should probably unfriend me first. I might be inclined to light your ass up. Just kidding. Maybe.

 “Come my love, I'll tell you a taleOf a boy and girl and their love storyAnd how he loved her oh so muchAnd all the charms she did possessNow this did happen once upon a timeWhen things were not so complexAnd how he worshipped the ground she walkedAnd when he looked in her eyes he became obsessedThis love was stronger than the powers so darkA prince could have within his kingdomHis spells to weak and steal a heartWithin her breast but only sleepingHe said "Don't you know I love you oh so muchAnd lay my heart at the foot of your dress?"She said "Don't you know that storybook love'sAlways have a happy ending?"Then he swooped her up just like in the booksAnd on his stallion they rode awayMy love is like a storybook storyBut it's as real as the feelings I feelMy love is like a storybook storyBut it's as real as the feelings I feel"
