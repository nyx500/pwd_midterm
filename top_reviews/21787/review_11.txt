If you are a person who grew up in the US or UK or in any part of the world or I dunno a spaceship, you would probably know what someone means when they say “Inconceivable!” but for me, a person who grew in Pakistan where the most popular thing was Justin Bieber singing “Baby” while the children tried to copy whatever the heck that dude was saying, life was not so generous. I didn’t know what Harry Potter was. He was a jadoogar ki aulad (son of a magician) as my mother likes to say. A few months ago I was looking at a list of the best “book to film” adaptations and this baby was on the top. I immediately googled it and I thought what the heck? This gets the top spot. Of course then I watched the film and then I bought the book and then I read it and the rest is history.This has been said so many times and I will sound like a broken record but that film is amazing. In this case, I don’t believe it’s a case of either/or; both mediums of telling this story are delightful, and I love them both for different reasons. First off, that film is fantastic. The casting, the direction … it’s pure perfection. Yes the effects are cheesy but that was 1987 so *shrugs*. Yes, the film does exclude some points and there some itty bitty changes but HAVE YOU SEEN THAT FILM? Plus it gets bonus points for *ahem ahem* Cary Elwes. I don’t even need to explain myself.Now onto the review. You know some people might tell you that the plot of this book is pathetic/dumb/over done/nothing special. But i would strongly disagree with them. Why? Well because for me Goldman took the itty bitty pieces that everyone uses and he created something new from it. I mean isn't this a stereotype? Poor boy. Pretty girl. But Goldman has included so much more elements into this tale. First off, that beginning line is everything.

“This is my favorite book in all the world, though I have never read it.”

 Next off, the concept is so novel. You rarely come across something like this. It's fast paced and it can tick every box you can think of. As the author says, this book has:

“Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles.”

 He used the word "beautifulest" and the only thing that isn't there is magical realism and ice-cream but everything else is there. That's a winner for me dude.Secondly, i am a horribly sarcastic person in real life. So for me (one of) the strength of this book lies in the narration from Goldman himself. The way he pokes fun, his satire, his commentary ... throughout the book it's hilarious. From the very beginning, the reader is introduced to the story through the witty voice of Goldman. For me this outside narration feels like an entirely different story in itself.And then we have the characters. The characters in "The Princess Bride" are phenomenal from all angles. No matter what kinds of characters you prefer reading about, there’s bound to be one that you end up rooting for.👑
Westley:
Let's cut the crap and get to the real point. Westley. Now and forever. I love everything about him: his remarkable bravery, his unfailing loyalty to Buttercup, and even his constant reply of “As you wish.” If you’re looking for a dashing hero that will make your heart flutter, then look no further than this farm boy!👑
Inigo:
 I was astounded by the amount of information we learn in this novel about Inigo’s past compared to the what background the movie provides. A better understanding of his past allowed me to appreciate Inigo so much more, and it made that one famous line infinitely more satisfying.👑
Fezzik:
Oh, Fezzik. I love his clever rhymes, his sensitive side, and his faithful courage. I prefer his portrayal in the novel rather than that of the movie because the reader can see more of his inner personality beyond the outward stereotype of his bulky size.👑
Prince Humperdinck:
I mean, he has a Zoo of Death in which he methodically keeps deadly animals in carefully organized levels in order to hunt and kill them for fun. If that doesn’t scream “evil psychotic prince,” then I don’t know what does.👑
Buttercup:
I loved Buttercup. Yes she is a 'damsel in distress' but dude chill. She is kind and caring although a bit vain. She doesn't bear grudges and goes with Humperdinck to save Westley. A gem. A true gem. A masterpiece. Please dear person read this.Plus, I took the job out of Nina's hands for the time being and decided to explain Hogwarts Houses with Princess Bride quotes:
