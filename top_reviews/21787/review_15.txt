I absolutely loved The Silent Gondoliers. It was just a perfect gem in every way, 5 stars was not enough reward for it's brilliance. With that in mind I was hyped to read The Princess Bride and not ready at all for the experience.When I lived in Jerusalem I used to leave the snowy heights in winter for the perpetual summer of the Dead Sea, the lowest place on earth, about an hour away. Swimming was impossible, the water buoyed you up, rejected you even so that body parts were impossible to keep submerged. It was such fun, an amazing experience, something really special. After that I would run for the deep pools of fresh spring water to wash the salt off my skin. You jump in and sink to the bottom. It is a shock to the brain after the floating on the Dead Sea. You can't prepare yourself for the sinking, it is like an optical illusion, but a sensory one instead. And so it was with the Princess Bride.For me, it just sank like a stone beneath the consciousness of the fun and perfection of the Silent Gondoliers. There you go. Maybe I will watch the film one day, I hear it is better.
