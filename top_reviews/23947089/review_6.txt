I am. I am flabbergasted that I am giving a Mistborn Era2 book only ⭐⭐⭐, but here we are. I think it boils down to the INCREASED focus on Cosmere connections and worldbuilding we get in this book. (I would recommend reading at least Mistborn: Secret History, Emperor's Soul, and Words of Radiance before getting to this novel.) It's a whole lot of our page time being Wasted on info dumps that I feel like could have been taken out (along with the characters giving them) and produced a more focused and entertaining novel. If I wanted to learn about Shard/worldhopper/magic systems in depth, I would go read the extensive wiki.Here is my full video review: https://youtu.be/LDICzLzYnz4 I want to take a moment here to reflect on my relationship with recent Sanderson releases. I haven't loved them (I'm thinking of Rhythm of War, Starsight, and Lost Metal) as much as his older novels. Either my taste or his style has been shifting, and I think it's some of both. For all of those novels, my complaint is the same: too much worldbuilding, not enough character work. (We can't even blame the enlarging of the Cosmere, because Starsight doesn't get that excuse.) It's just that worldbuilding details don't excite or entertain me when divorced from the angst of the characters.
