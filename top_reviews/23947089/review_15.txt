Intriguing. There's a lot of set up to get going really quickly, along with enough reminders of what's happened for those of us who haven't reread "Bands of Mourning​"​​ recently. It's only the very beginning of the book, and we're already greeted by our familiar heroes and their interactions, detective work, social investigation and pressures, and explosive action, just as I've come to expect and enjoy from Sanderson, especially in this series. A couple specific developments in the last book are looking to develop greatly in this one, and I'm chomping at the bit to see how Wax and the gang resolve their searches and goals, while also being excited to see how Sanderson incorporates discoveries in this entry into both the world of Scadriel and into the Cosmere at large. I will defintely be looking to buy "The Lost Metal" on release without a moment's hesitation thanks to my trust in Sanderson as an author and thanks to how things are looking to set up and play out in a way that I'm sure will throw me for a loop. Thank you to Macmillan/Tor-Forge for the Extended Excerpt in exchange for a review.
