My first thought was, he lied in every word...Isn’t it funny? So, you read 7 books (8, if you count The Wind Through The Keyhole), you’re at the end of the last one and you’re wondering how the heck will it end. It’s not about the journey anymore. The journey is over. It’s 110% about the destination. You have no predictions, no clues, no nothing. You can’t even try to guess because your mind is completely empty and all you have are the words you’re reading, page after page after page. It’s like you held your breath for the last 300 pages or so.And then you’re finally there, standing beside Roland, crying the names of your friends and loved ones and ka-mates; those names carried clear in that strange air, as if they would echo forever.You enter the Dark Tower.You begin to climb the stairs and soon enough you find yourself at the top of the Dark Tower, watching your name carved on the last door.You open it.And you understand......how useless your life can be. How your dreams and hopes mean nothing. They aren’t even really yours. You’re like Sisif, rolling a boulder uphill, without end. But it’s OK. Because you forget. And you start a new cycle. Again. And again. And again. Until the end of time.Oh Discordia! That is the truth.
