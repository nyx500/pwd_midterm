Full video review here:https://youtu.be/uB2TFe7SBNk(Updated 2023 video review above)I'm not sure there's enough I can say about this book that would do it justice. After feeling lukewarm about the first book, Golden Son gave me everything I hopes when I began the series. I like my Games with less Hunger and more Ender, and this one delivered just that. Incredible action, deeply emotional character connections, stunning betrayals, and exactly the sci-fi adventure I've been looking for. This series went from one I wasn't certain I'd continue to one I can't get enough of now. The highest of recommends and the best science-fiction novel I've read since Ender's Game.
