I don't know! This was never as special as Alanna to me and it still feels a bit THERE. It all seems to come somewhat easy for Daine. No idea what's going on with the plot.I do like all the updates on the Alanna characters. And I like Daine!(Why couldn't Daine have more friends her age??? The few that are there are SO minor.)
