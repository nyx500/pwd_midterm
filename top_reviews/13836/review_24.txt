My first review from 2010: After raiders destroy her happy village, a young peasant girl named Daine joins up with the Queen's Own hostler. They travel to Tortall, having dangerous adventures along the way. Once in Tortall, Daine discovers she has Wild Magic, which enables her to communicate and control all animals. Despite the many attacks by monsters, this book lacks any narrative tension, probably because I actively dislike Daine. Review from 2020: I haven't entirely warmed to Daine but I no longer dislike her. Maybe I was just unhappy these books weren't the Lioness Quartet? On a second read I think these are great middle grade or ya fantasy. My two remaining qualms are: Daine thinks all the middle-aged men are hot (Jon, George, Numair) despite being 13, and I hate that the dragon mage dies in what is basically a suicidal attack when she's got a much beloved new dragonet to take care of.
