I loved this story when I was younger, and I’m so glad that it hadn’t lost its magic at all, even if I’m a bit older now!I loved Daine in this book and how strong she was! She fought so hard to protect people, and her animal friends, even if she was a bit stubborn at times. I also liked the storyline, even if I have read this multiple times before, I remembered everything that happened but it didn’t spoil the story for me at all! I loved the travelling, the training, the dragon and other magical creatures, and I really loved Numair, even if we won’t get any romance until later in the series.9 out of 10
