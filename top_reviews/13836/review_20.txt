I received a free ebook version of this book from Netgalley. Thankyou to both Netgalley and the publisher for giving me the chance to read this! My review is still honest.Believe it or not, this was my first Tamora Pierce novel! Because of this, I didn't realise until I'd started that I should have read the Alanna quartet first, but I still got the gist of the story and I don't think it impacted my enjoyment/understanding too much.Wild Magic follows Daine, a young girl with a secret, tragic past. When she meets Onua, one of the Queen's Riders, and takes a job with her, she is thrust into a world of mages and war and Immortals emerging from realms they haven't escaped from in centuries. She also might have a little magic herself-and it's so damn cool.This book does reflect when it was written. It was great, but it doesn't have the same vibe as a modern fantasy, and if I'm right about my guess of a potential romance, it's definitely not something that would be accepted if written today. However, the female characters in this are strong and would be so inspiring for a young reader. I wish I'd read this when I was a child! Daine, Alanna and Onua are such great role models and I really loved reading from Daine's perspective.The action was good, especially towards the end. For the first third or so, I thought it was a little too action packed! It just seemed like it threw me straight in with no world building (which could be because I hadn't read the Alanna books) but after a while, it straightened itself out and I was just enthralled. I was so excited to know what happened next! The end battle was so exciting and tense.By far my favourite aspect though is the magic. The animals were some of my favourite characters and it was nothing like what I've read before. It's one of those books that makes you want to be in that world.A solid read! I'm intrigued to know what happens next.
