3.5 starsThis new series brings us Daine, a young girl with a Tragic Past, who is alone in the world but for her trusty pony. She comes across Onua, an ostler for the palace, and they befriend each other. Onua quickly realizes that Daine has a Gift with animals. Adventures ensue.I liked Daine a lot. She has a lot to deal with in her past and in discovering her abilities and how to use them, and the responsibilities that come with it. It was nice to see Alanna, George, Jonathan and the old gang again, but I like that they didn't take over the story. This is very much Daine's story and her coming of age that this story is telling. Numair is a hoot, and even if there are talking animals everywhere, they're only talking to one person, so it wasn't quite as silly as it could have been. This is much better paced than the original series, which was hacked up and messed around with by the publisher. I'm curious to see if this'll follow just this one arc that's set up here, or if the next three books will be more board in focus, like the Song of the Lioness novellas. It also helps that Pierce had more pages to write her story here than she did with the first quartet.The narration for this quartet is a full-cast audio, and it's kind of a mixed bag. I do like that all the characters get their own actors, and most of them are quite good. However, the main narrator sounds kind of wooden and mechanical. I don't know if she was trying to stay neutral to contrast with the characters, but it was jarring at times.
