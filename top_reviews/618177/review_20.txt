A friend here on GR asked me about short opinion of this book and if I can write something. So Agos, I hope you find this at least bit helpful.It was in my early days on Goodreads I read this but my memory is still surprisingly fresh partially because in those days my number of reads per year was barely dozen or so rather than 3-digit numbers I am now managing each year.Despite being written in 80's this is not Tolkien-esque fantasy but more inspired by, as name says it, legends and myths. This is story of heroes larger than life, great love, impossible odds on battlefield where champion meets champion. All wrapped up in warm pathos that much later Rothfuss mastered so well. From it's strong points comes it's weak one. Since It's inspired by legends and myths dialogues are also in that vein which makes them odd by today's standards, there is great insta-love and characters that don't even try to be realistic or plausible. There are many things like that that can be viewed as bug or feature depending on your inclinations.This isn't book of rich, subtle flavors but distilled heroic fantasy.I for one had lot of fun. Solid 3.5 stars.
