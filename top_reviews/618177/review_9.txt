I read this book years ago and I consider it a testament to how good of a book it is that I remember it all quite clearly. In many ways it is not a great fantasy novel, and in fact I remember that around the half way point I nearly quit it because I found it a bit too formulaic. I'm so glad I didn't. The last third of this book is some of the best fantasy has to offer. The last third of this book is honestly so good it raises what should have been a 2 star novel to a 4 star one. Had the entire book been that good, it would have easily been a 5 star book. It's that impressive.The story behind the book is almost as stunning as the work itself. Gemmell was diagnosed with cancer. He began writing a story about siege against overwhelming odds. He wrote it at a frantic pace apparently completing most of it in two weeks but leaving it unfinished. He planned on finishing it when he knew what would happen to himself, if he lived, so would his heroes, if he found out there was no hope, again, the same fate would befall his heroes.Then something happened. Apparently he was contacted by a doctor and told it was a misdiagnosis and he was in fact fine. Well, that one wouldn't really work with the storyâ€¦ I mean, do the two sides realize it was just a misunderstanding, laugh about the whole siege thing, borrow a cup of sugar and go back home? Doesn't really fit. He put the story down and didn't come back to it for five years when he decided to give it a proper ending.It's a fun origin story, but I think it also captures what makes this novel so unique. The characters are in a hopeless, terrifying situation, trying to keep up their spirits, trying to grab any chances they see and when moments of hope hit, they shine. Gemmell wrote a fantasy novel, but he was writing his real life there quite accurately, and even if it's not the best prose, he made an amazing tale. 4/5 stars.
