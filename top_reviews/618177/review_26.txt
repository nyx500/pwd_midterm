“We are not made for life at all, old horse. It is made for us. We live it. We leave it.”

I read this as book of the month with The Fantasy Guild! Honestly, I heard a lot about Gemmell but I don’t think it is the kind of books that I would usually pick up on my own. I thought it would be a different kind of experience and I ended up enjoying it more that expected!This book was published in 1984 so I kept that in mind while reading it. I thought it would be much harder to read and enjoy because books written decades ago usually are -for me at least- and I did not want another experience like Tigana! But when I started reading it, it wasn’t challenging to read, it was pretty much straightforward and the prose was good! There are some stereotyping and sexism issues that authors are more aware of nowadays but I think for a book written 40 years ago, I can be more lenient and they did not affect my enjoyment of the book!There are 2 main story lines that converge together, that of Rek and that of Druss. There are interesting characters for sure in the novel and my favorite has to be Serbitar! Now Rek’s story line had a major problem which is the insta-romance, it is one of the fastest most intense romances I ever read which made it very hard to believe! Druss is kind of unique given that his success and legacies live in the past but we still see some of them in this book. I loved the interactions between the characters and that Ulric (The invader) also respects Druss!

“No one ever gets out of this life alive.”

The plot is interesting, when I read the synopsis I was excited because I expected something different. But basically our heroes are defending their place and they have 6 walls to protect them before the enemies army which is many times greater than their numbers.I did not have problems with the pacing and finished the book in 2 days! I just was a bit not happy with the finale because it was very rushed and many things felt underwhelming just because we are told them instead of being showed them. I would have gone for 4 stars but the ending kind of irked me so I think 3.5 stars will do for now! The story can work as a standalone but it is part of a series and I am not sure if I will be continuing it yet!

“He who fears to lose will never win.”

Summary: I enjoyed this book more than I expected to, I think the bar was low to start with which made me enjoy it more but it does not mean it is a bad book. The writing is good, the characters are mostly okay but the romance was weird! The plot was interesting but it never felt finished for me!
