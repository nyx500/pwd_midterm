This book was okay. While I really enjoy epic fantasy and find ti to be one of my favorite genres, there are books like this that are skilled but slow and reveal ideas that other fantasy authors brought to fruition more fully and successfully while building on books like this as a foundation. The challenge of vying for thrones and a murderous crew of nobility playing a a predetermined set of rules was skillfully mined by George RR Martin as I am sure most people that read this will know. this book handled it slightly different due to the culture and rules for honors established by the author in the setting and context.It was interesting watching a young girl that had been fairly ignorant of the politics of her family rise ot power in the midst ro the treacherous and deadly environment. While ponderous and plodding at times, the texture and interweaving of the plot's complexity made this a good read.Three stars.
