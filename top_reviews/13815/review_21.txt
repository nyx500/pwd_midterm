***4.5 stars ***This was a great continuation of the empire series. In this installment we get to see characters from the Riftwar books. The story of Mara also continues to grow from the daughter of the empire book. I love her character and the strong female lead in this series. In this book we meet new characters. I really enjoyed Kevin’s part in this story, I won’t say anymore because I don’t want to spoil anything. There was political plotting and great battle scenes. This book had it all as well as seeing the characters continue to evolve. The ending of the book set up things for the last in the series, and wow do I want to see what happens next. I would highly recommend this series as a whole!
