Wow, again. As a guy, I sometimes have trouble connecting with a female main character, but not in this case. While Mara is about as distant from me as can be, she's a fantastic heroine & I hung on every word of the fantastic writing. My emotions bumped right along with her situation. Again, I stayed up too late reading & hated to put the book down. The ending was perfect. The trilogy could have easily stopped on this book, but there is another & that's like finishing a feast with plenty of room for sumptuous desserts & no waistline to worry about. On to the next!
