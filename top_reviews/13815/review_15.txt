This is the second book in the Empire Trilogy by Raymond E. Feist and Janny Wurts. I really enjoyed the first book. I loved how a young and innocent girl was thrust into the deadly games of politics where any wrong move could be met with her death as well as the death of her loved ones and shame for anyone associated with the name of her family the Acoma. In book one Mara is 17, becomes Ruling Lady of the Acoma facing powerful enemies with only 37 warriors to protect her and her hard to defend estate lands. Through cunning, the help of her beloved advisors and a quick grasp of the Games of Council, Mara outwits one of the five most powerful families in Kelewen. Survives attack and marriage with a violent man to restore lost honor to the Acoma. This book laid the foundation needed to understand this world and it's people. At the same time it was exciting and fun. I didn't feel like it was an introduction used to prepare for the rest of the trilogy and was absorbed at page one.Book two knocked my socks off. It starts right after book one ends and you fall seamlessly back into the world Feist and Wurts created. Not only that, the pace picks up and the stakes are raised even higher as Mara and the Acoma are faced with an even more ruthless enemy. Surprisingly, this conflict is no longer the center of the story. In a world steeped in tradition, the face of things begin to change. Life as the Empire knows it is torn apart by the effect of interaction with the 'Barbarian World Midkemia'. As Mara and the highest of rulers start to question tradition the resulting consequences are epic. We see our heroine, Mara, make decisions in haste that cause more conflict and we cannot predict how this story will play out.I was completely invested in this book. I could not put it down and I am anxiously looking forward to reading the third one.
