A wonderful book, rich with feeling. 5 stars easily earned.The 2nd in the Empire trilogy pits Mara and her classy team of experts against the despicable villainy of Tasaio and the powerful Minwanabi family.I love the characterization, which is rich and nuanced, these are characters you can really care about. The narrative is extensive and broad, suiting the Epic Fantasy genre. The story got me in and I was immersed - even though I've read this book multiple times before.I was often smiling while reading this book, it does that to you. Although there are heart rending moments as well.There is romance and it occasionally gets pretty physical at times, but the narrative context is always strong, and the scenes are very tastefully written - hence nothing gratuitous.The bottomline, this is a fantastic part of the "The Empire Trilogy," and I would happily recommend it to anyone to read - provided you read "Daughter of the Empire," first.
