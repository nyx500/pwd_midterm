Don’t be misled by those who class this as fantasy, humour, or just fiction. This is actually a profound philosophical and theological treatise, exploring good and evil, nature versus nurture, free will, war, pollution, and organised religion. 😉But it’s cleverly disguised as a madcap caper featuring angels, demons, the M25 motorway, Manchester, raining fish, dolphins, Atlantis, aliens, the Apocalypse, the young Antichrist, Americans, footnotes for Americans, tunnelling Tibetans, witches, witch-finders, whales, Hell's Angels, Queen and Freddie Mercury, junk food made of junk, nuclear power, a flaming car, satanic nuns, an inadvertent baby-swap, a book of prophecy, and more besides. Lots of ineffability, too.The writing is so like Douglas Adams that it could be mistaken for a missing volume of Hitchhiker's, except for the pages of Just William slipped in, Calvino style.Image source imdb.The Heavy StuffInscription from Terry: “We made the Devil do it…”It echoes a line in the book: “The Devil hardly ever made anyone do anything. He didn’t have to.” The weight is smuggled into a plot that is simultaneously simple, complicated, and counter-intuitive. The Antichrist is born, but accidentally goes to a boringly normal, rural couple, rather than the intended satanists. With the Apocalypse due around his 11th birthday, opposing forces try to ensure they’ll win, which requires first realising there’s been a mix up - and then fixing it. On that simple trunk, a plethora of sub-plots and an even larger number of larger-than-life characters twist, and climb, and intertwine.Amidst the chaos and the warring factions, the fundamental question is whether Adam, the young Antichrist, will fulfil his destiny, whether “Birth is just the start.. Upbringing is everything”. After all, the Devil started off as an angel.The Odd CoupleAziraphale (angel) and Crowley (demon) have been on Earth a long time, developed a grudging fondness for it, its inhabitants, and even each other. Their tetchily co-operative, affectionately teasing relationship is central to the plot, the philosophy, and the humour.They’ve reached an “Arrangement” after realising “they have more in common with their immediate opponent than their remote allies… tacit non-interference… made certain that while neither really won, also neither really lost.” Heaven wants to win the war; humanised Aziraphale comes to realise that he would prefer to avoid it.Bibliophilia“Aziraphale was an angel, but he also worshiped books.” “Aziraphale collected books. If he were totally honest with himself he would have to have admitted that his bookshop was simply somewhere to store them. He was not unusual in this. In order to maintain his cover as a typical second-hand book seller, he used every means short of actual physical violence to prevent customers from making a purchase. Unpleasant damp smells, glowering looks, erratic opening hours - he was incredibly good at it.”Near where where Pratchett spent much of his life, was a cottage given over to second hand books. There were no unpleasant smells, but opening hours were limited, as were payment methods. Books were piled high and deep (double/triple) and vaguely sorted by category, but not by author... except for Pratchett. Here it is (sadly, it closed in 2018): There’s a larger version in my GR photos HERE. Quotes - Religion* “God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.”I particularly like the fact the last phrase is emphasised with italics, even though, in a pitch-dark room, it’s barely relevant. * “When it came to avoiding going to church, the church he solidly avoided going to was… no-nonsense Church of England.”* “Being brought up as a Satanist tended to take the edge off it. A Saturday thing.”* Crowley is embarrassed by the enthusiasm of satanists, just as a “Vietnam veteran would feel about someone who wears combat gear to Neighbourhood Watch meetings”. * “Voodoun is a very interesting religion for the whole family, even those members of it who are dead.”* “Marvin got religion. Not the quiet, personal kind, that involves doing good deeds and living a better life; not even the kind that involves putting on a suit and ringing people’s door bells; but the kind that involves having your own TV network and getting people to send you money.”Quotes - Good and Evil* “Most demons weren’t deep down evil” but like “tax inspectors - doing an unpopular job, maybe, but essential to the overall operation”.* Often, the difference between good and evil isn’t obvious: some of the world leaders Aziraphale thinks good are assumed to be evil by Crowley.* “If we beat them we’d have to be our own deadly enemies… it’s no good anyone winning”. So, “You just had to decide who your friends really were.” Quotes - Destiny versus Free WillSlightly spoilery.* “You can’t refuse to be who you are… Your birth and destiny are part of the Great Plan.”...“I don’t see why it matters what is written… It can always be crossed out.”* “He was left alone! He grew up human! He’s not Evil Incarnate or Good Incarnate, he’s just… a human incarnate.”* “No one around Adam was ever in full control of their own mind”.Quotes - Time* “The future came and went in the mildly discouraging way that futures do.”* “Memory… works backwards as well as forwards… Agnes didn’t see the future. That’s just a metaphor. She remembered it.”* “On the cusp of recollection, a memory of things that hadn’t happened.”* Accurate predictions are little use if they’re too narrow and specific. For example, “Do notte buye Betamacks” was only meaningful for a few short years.* “DON’T THINK OF IT AS DYING, said Death. JUST THINK OF IT AS LEAVING EARLY TO AVOID THE RUSH.”Quotes - People and Relationships* “Many people, meeting Aziraphale for the first time, formed three impressions: that he was English, that he was intelligent, and that he was gayer than a tree full of monkeys on nitrous oxide.”* “Courting is always difficult when… an elderly female relative in the house… It’s much worse when the relative has been dead for three hundred years.”* “Newt had indeed been harbouring certain thoughts about Anathema; not just harbouring them, in fact, but dry-docking them, refitting them, giving them a good coat of paint and scraping the barnacles off their bottom.”* “Pollution [one of the Apocalyptic Horsepersons], while still walking, nevertheless gave the impression of oozing.”Quotes - Other* “A rain-swept courtyard full of righteous dustbins.”* “Leaping gratefully onto this new ice floe in the bewildering stream of consciousness.”* “Her spelling… was not so much appalling as three hundred years too late.” Similarly, if anyone questions something my father says or writes, he claims it’s just archaic; impossible to disprove!* “Every dog is still only two meals away from being a wolf.”Quote - Best One-LinerA Hell’s Angel asks one of the biking Four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse what chapter they belong to: “REVELATIONS, he said. CHAPTER SIX. ‘Verses two to eight’, added the boy… helpfully.”TV AdaptationFab cast, and Gaimain was heavily involved, so my hopes were high, and largely rewarded. David Tennant as Crowley and Michael Sheen as Aziraphale were brilliant together, and it looked great. It suffered a little from being too similar to the very recent adaptation of American Gods (see my review HERE). And Aziraphale's bibliophilia was underplayed, but overall, good.
