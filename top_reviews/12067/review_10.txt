Heaven, hell, demons, angels, a ragtag group of children, witch-hunters, witches, Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, and the Antichrist all teamed up to make this book happen. And a readathon, a discount book-selling website, the buzz from a streaming-service television adaptation, boredom, poor decision-making, and a lack of social life had to come together to get me to read it.And it turned out pretty good.In spite of those long lists, the pacing of this was kind of clunky and odd. You'd think a book about the homoerotic enemies to friends/lovers? relationship between an angel and a demon with the rapidly approaching Antichrist-inspired apocalypse in the background would be, at the very least, a nonstop excitement rollercoaster.Regrettably you would be just a little bit wrong.This is, on the whole, very funny and fun, but it is also intermittently quite boring. This is because this book indulges in a dreadful habit known in certain villainous circles as "multiple perspectives," which means that sometimes you are hanging out with characters you enjoy and they are bantering and goofing and crazy hijinks-ing and then right when the going gets good, boom. You are in the English countryside with a group of children.C'est la vie, but in my opinion this whole thing would be better if children didn't exist.You decide whether I mean this book or this life.Bottom line: The most disappointing still-recommended read of my lifetime! I'll survive.3.5---------------------hard to say which i could use more at the moment: anything written by neil gaiman, or a good omen.i'm going with both!clear ur shit prompt 6: steal a book from someone's tbrfollow my progress here
