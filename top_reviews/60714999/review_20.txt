Explosive 🔥 🗡️ This is a story that grows more powerful and more fiery and ascends to greater heights within its genre as it proceeds, coming far more into its own at 300 or 400 pages than at 100 or 200. Ironically, at first I mistrusted the male protagonist Raihn and embraced Oraya the female protagonist. However by the end the reverse was true - I trusted Raihn but not her. A moodier, angrier, more conflicted warrior woman you will not find. Right up to the final page. This is not someone you hug. Kiss but not hug. And you stay prepared to defend yourself from her, her weapons and her wild mind changes.I like that she is BA, I like their explosive 💥 consummation, I like the warrior man Raihn obviously is by the time of the book’s denouement, I like her awesome fighting spirit. I like that she is a wildcat. I like that her fighting heart is rich with tenderness and compassion. But she is also completely unpredictable. Prepare yourself for a mind bending ride. You will be rattled. ⚔️👩🏻🩸🔥
