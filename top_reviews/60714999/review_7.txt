well you better do so in the sequel 😤 okay i'm definitely gonna to be in the minority hereso please don't rip my head off for this rating 😭starting off strong, the ending was really good, i didn't expect this at all, my jaw? on the floor, lol. the tournament and the backstory of each trial were thought through well and were really interesting but that's about it lolspeaking of trials, they were what i looked most forward to in the book but i can't be the only one who was hella confused by them? they all seemed too similar and the fighting scenes were insanely repetitive and it lowkey made me wanna skim read them oraya is a strong character, she is badass and i love her. but in said trials, she was saved so many times last minute by raihn and it made her seem week and it annoyed the hell out of me tension? where? i can't see her 🧐 i needed more angst, i craved it and i didn't feel like i had to know what was going to happen next. i put the book down multiple times because i was boredthere was this scene between oraya and raihn at 70%, which was good but hello?? you're telling me i had to wait that long to just feel a tiny weeny bitty spark? i needed more of the banter that we saw so early on & also, it bothered me so much how often he said "there she is"🧍🏽‍♀️ like, okay.. no need to mention it every single time vincent, oh vincent, i love him. that's all i have to say this was supposed to be a 5 star book, i really needed it to be one but after finishing the book, i thought about it and had to give it a 3.5 rating (lol the dramatics) 🫠 looking back at my review i might lower the rating 💀 but for now i will stick with it, just because of the plot twist & my soft spot for romantasy — SPOILER WARNING (this part is going to be even more messy because i can't be bothered to bring structure in it) there were a lot of holes in the world building and it made me so angry because they could've been easily explained in the beginning. so there are 3 different vampire clans, the bloodborn, the shadowborn and the nightborn. why does everyone hate the bloodborn? what is the conflict between the hiaj and rishan? is it only about power? about revenge? and revenge for what? for overthrowing each other in the past? i. don't. get. itisn't it weird that mische and raihn never talked about how they might have to kill each other if it comes to it? i can't be the only one who felt nothing when raihn died? it was so obvious he wasn't gonna stay deadwe were robbeddddddd!!!???? we could've had training scene with full of tension, did we get it? no, of course not. wasted potential, smh
