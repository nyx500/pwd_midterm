My bloody, angsty, stabby, spicy book child is now in the world!I am so so excited to share this book with you officially, and I hope that you have as much fun reading it as I had writing it. After finishing The War of Lost Hearts series, I was so afraid of venturing into a different world with different characters after those ones had so captured my heart. But as soon as I got to know Oraya and Raihn and their dark, dangerous world, those anxieties were immediately put to rest.So, will I give myself five stars? Hell yeah I will -- I had five stars worth of fun writing this book!I so hope that you love it! <3--

Didn’t move. Instead, I lay my palm flat against his chest.I surprised even myself when I replied, “Not tonight.”
