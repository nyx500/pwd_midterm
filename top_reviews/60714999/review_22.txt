Carissa Ma'am. Carissa Broadbent Ma'am. You have murdered me with this book. You have wounded me, gutted my very heart, yanked it out of my chest, and left me bleeding in the open air. This book killed me and if you're reading this review, you're seeing a ghost of me typing this review right now and if you're see me in your timeline it's a ghost of me flying around. Is there any words that I need to say other than ‚ú®Ô∏èPURE PERFECTION‚ú®Ô∏è? Because it was. And that sums up the whole book in two words.That's it. That's my review.NO I'M JOKING- GAAAAAHHHH I KNOW I'M BLABBERING- IT'S BECAUSE MY WOUND IS STILL FRESH AND RED RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T THINK I CAN SURVIVE THIS AND I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE A SEVERE WITHDRAWAL EFFECTS FROM THIS BOOK.alright, alright. Let's start my review.The story, well it's perfect. Fucking perfect. It was just pure exhilarating and very much hooking and the rush was just so fucking mesmerizing. Do I even need to say more? It's pure perfection! When I saw that this was about vampire with wings with a mix of hunger games, I was very much intrigued and intrigued I was. Then I read it. Then it killed me in the process. I'm having a lot of feelings at the same time right now and for my own standard it's a huge fuckig success. I love it. I love this.The writing was magnificent. The flow was perfect, none of it went too slow or too fast. The time stretch and the way things flow in the book was in the perfect amount of speed. Everything was jsut so perfect. I love it cause it's my favorite go-to POV in books and the 1st person POV made Oraya's character so living in a sense I can feel her physically. I just love it.The characters were pure perfection. I love Oraya so much and I will always be on her side üò≠ I fucking hate and love Raihn at the same time and it fucking killed me to feel this way- I need help seriously. My most favorite character is none other than Daddy Vincent, I know I'm fucking pathetic to admit that he's my most favorite character. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MAN WAS MADE OF BUT I COULD FEEL THE SEXY SENSUAL APPEAL FROM HIM AND THE WAY HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ORAYA WAS SO INTERESTING AND HEARTWARMING AT SOME POINT DIDN'T HELP ME DAMPENING MY ATTRACTION TO HIM. Everyone and everything in this book is just perfection.Raihn. Vincent. You have fucking destroyed me, you know that?I don't fucking care if this review sounds so fucking bias or it feels like I'm trying to please the author. The book fucking deserves this. HERE'S MY HUGE ASS 5 STARS. TAKE IT. TAKE IT ALL. read this book. read this. I swear it'll fucking gut you in the chest and change your life at the same time. That's it. That's the review.
