“I was honest even when I didn’t mean to be. He did not fear my darkness, nor pity my compassion. And the truth was, the idea of dying without knowing him completely was torturous.” This book is obviously very loved, and I do think it lives up to the hype. I adored the way the romance and our main characters were written, and I think those two aspects deserve all of the stars. The rest of the writing, and the way it flowed, gets 4 stars; that might just be a me thing.“Living this life had required me to learn how to be many contradictory things at once. It forced me to divvy my mind up into many little rooms, each containing a different part of myself.”I absolutely loved Oraya from the start. She’s strong, determined, and intelligent. The fact that so many underestimate her, makes her successes even more satisfying to read about. She’s also very sympathetic, and it was easy for me to feel her pain and confusion while she goes through life-changing moments in this story. “I would beg,” he murmured. “For you, I would.”It took me until about 30% in to truly understand why everyone is obsessed with Raihn. Then I fell hard for him, too. He is romantic, sarcastic, powerful, and gentle. Add a heartbreaking backstory, and I’m a goner. My bestie told me I would fall in love, and she was right.The plot is exhilarating. This book seriously does not slow down. While I appreciate how heart-pounding and terrifying each trial was, I do wish the author had balanced out some of this very fast-paced plot with a few more heartfelt moments and a bit more world building. That doesn't mean that the world wasn't built well; It was clearly written, and I think the novella will give me that extra bit of background I'm craving. The reveals and the twists had me screaming, taking breaks to process, and breathing through very conflicting emotions. This author also knows how to write villains very well; More so, how to reveal them. I saw certain twists coming but not the way they happened, and I appreciate that shock factor. I was left speechless a couple of times throughout reading this book; One reveal in particular took me a little while to get over, but I'm into it now. My favourite side character was definitely Mische. She's a bubbly and friendly vampire with a sad backstory but an optimistic world view. I’m very attached and need more of her. She's my darling.“Because he looked at me in sheer awe—like I was the most incredible thing he had ever seen. Like I was a fucking goddess.”Back to the romance. I love their relationship development and the fact that their banter made me giggle and blush. 🤭🥰 It’s tension-filled, slow burn, and about a lot more than just sex and attraction. Don’t get me wrong, the spice was very appreciated, and I like that it was tastefully written. However, I was impressed by the fact that their chemistry and mutual respect are felt way before they even kiss.Overall, this book is perfectly entertaining and worth a read. The writing didn’t necessarily wow me throughout, but I’m definitely looking forward to reading the novella and the second book. Reading this book was even more fun with lovely Hanna! I couldn't imagine not sharing this experience with her. Thank you so much for reading this with me, babe! 💕 An extra thought: At a certain point, a mysterious character calls Oraya “Dove.” He probably shouldn’t be trusted—not sure about that yet—but I know I need more of him and his cheeky attitude... “Dove” is my new favourite nickname. 🕊
