‚Äùi wish our story could have had another ending‚Äù

‚Äî stephanie garber, WHAT IF I WAS SUICIDAL. WHAT IF THAT WAS MY LAST STRAW. how am i supposed to live, laugh, love in these conditions‚Äîthat ending was just rude. all that angst, sexual tension, JEALOUSY, hurting, THE PUSH AND PULL BETWEEN THEM, would kill anyone for her, the denial of their love for each other but it‚Äôs obvious that they‚Äôre each others one true love, JUST TO GIVE THEM THAT ENDING?!! FOR WHAT?? NOTHING üò≠i have been left a hollow shell of pain and longing and i will never recover from that. my chest hurts, my heart is aching, the end is near. i feel like screaming the way regina george did in that one scene!! 

‚Äùbut for tonight, let me pretend you're mine"

currently still crying over evajacks rn, im afraid i‚Äôll never be able to recover from them and this fkn book. they are my mf babies and i‚Äôll protect them with my LIFE.
‚Äúthere is nothing of equal value to me‚Äù
 LIVES WERE CHANGED, JACKS YOU WERE INSANE FOR THAT.

‚Äùdo you still think of me as just a tool?‚Äù jacks frowned. ‚Äúi try not to think of you at all.‚Äù
