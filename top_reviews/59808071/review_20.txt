5 ⭐️Edit:I’m a little more stable now so let me put some quotes for you so you can feel pain as well “𝐈𝐭 𝐡𝐮𝐫𝐭𝐬, 𝐉𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐬.”“𝐈 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰, 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞. 𝐈’𝐦 𝐠𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐚𝐟𝐞” I’m never talking to any of you againI can’t believe I’m holding back tears I’m blaming all of you for this- I’m not even capable of writing a pretty and good review. There were 2 tiny things I wasn’t a fan of but who freaking cares I am empty and sad and empty and sad and I want a handwritten apology by every single person that told me to read this “𝐈𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐢𝐭. 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐠𝐨 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐭𝐨 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐝𝐨𝐧’𝐭 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐦𝐞, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐝𝐨𝐧’𝐭 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞. 𝐁𝐮𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭, 𝐥𝐞𝐭 𝐦𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝 𝐲𝐨𝐮’𝐫𝐞 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐞” Stupid Jacks with your stupid dimples and your stupid blue eyes and your stupid golden hair and your stupid pretty voice and your stupid strength and your stupid jealousy and your stupid kindness and your stupid pretty words “𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐞” There is nothing of equal value to me, he said. He said, there is nothing of equal value to me. He freaking said, there is nothing of equal value to me “𝐈 𝐰𝐢𝐬𝐡 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠,” “𝐈 𝐝𝐨𝐧’𝐭 𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐚 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐈 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐞” If this series doesn’t have a happy ending I’m coming for you Stephanie istg I don’t know if I want to throw a rock at you or jump off a cliff with you bc someone is trying to kill you and you can’t swim so I hold you close while I swim you to safety and promise you I won’t let you die- f this shit I’m leaving “𝐁𝐮𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐞 𝐤𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐬𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐚𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐞. 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐚𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐚𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝. 𝐒𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐭 𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐛𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬.”Dear Apollo, I hope Jacks kisses you until you die with bloody tears running down your cheeks Love, MaiSmut:Forgot to do this- it’s a lil just a lil more mature than the first book but still nothing so no worries
