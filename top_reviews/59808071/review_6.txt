"but jacks didn't stop following her,and she had a feeling he never would"
you have got to be kidding me. oh my god, stop. i am sobbing. i swear this isn’t funny. i need a third book, right here, right now. there is absolutely no way that i can wait another year for the next releasei have a lot to say about this book. first off, i wanted to take my sweet sweet time with this one. i‘ve been waiting for so long and i refused to read it in one day. but you all know how consuming this world is, it’s so magical that it is nearly impossible to stop to read. and well, i did read it in one day and i miss this universe alreadylet me tell you.. the banter, teasing and taunting in this book?? extraordinary. i love jacks sarcasm, even eva adapted it. his dimples, oh my god his dimples. also, let’s not forget the fact that he calls her little fox. once eva doesn’t pay him enough attention, he for sure chimes in to get it back. and i‘m so here for it. my sweet wicked jacks. the way he is so protective over her 😭😭😭
"i do not want you dead, and i'll kill anyone who tries"
the plot is just amazing. i am just so in love with the whole universe, i was hooked since the beginning, i can’t even describe in words how badly i want to read the next one to know what will happen next. the ending really broke my heart and i swear if stephanie doesn’t put the pieces back together i will sue. i love eva with my whole heart and i really hope that we will see more of her badass side in the future. before reading this book, prepare for emotional damage! chapter 46 will break you.he called her love one time 😭 and there’s also a "he‘s injured and she helps him" trope with "please stay here tonight"
"in the morning, you can forget it. you can go back to pretending you don't like me, and i can pretend that i don’t care. but for tonight, let me pretend you're mine"
