Admit it: you’re here for Jacks.Edit: I can’t even comprehend how amazing this book is. Jacks is absolutely exquisite—I didn’t think it was possible to fall anymore in love with him. This book ripped out my heart!The TENSION. The STORY. The TWISTS. The ANGST. The PINING. The HEARTBREAK. The SEXUAL tension. Everything is just magical. I couldn’t put this book down. It’s all I’ve thought about for 3 days. From chapter 43 onwards, my heart was in tatters and my stomach a ball of nerves. I didn’t know what I was expecting, but it wasn’t that ending. MY GOD GET ME THE THIRD BOOK RIGHT NOW
