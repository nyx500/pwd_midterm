5/ 5⭐1/5 🌶️Like Jacks, this book was absolutely heartbreaking. HEARTBREAKING! I read it in like a day and a half (freaking work). I have been anxiously awaiting its release for about 4 months, and it did not disappoint. The ending killed a part of me and made me cry rivers. Like I re-read chapter 45 to 54 three times because I do not accept that ending. I need a third book, right here right now. There is absolutely no way that I can wait another year for the next release. I’m suffering from such intense heartbreak. I HATE, I mean HATE that ending. I know ballads don’t have happy ending but I require one for Jack. I Demand it! Quotes: “Happy endings can be caught, but they are difficult to hold on to. They are dreams that want to escape the night. They are treasure with wings. They are wild, feral, reckless things that need to be constantly chased, or they will certainly run away.”“I wish our story could have had another ending.”“Happy endings can be caught, but they are difficult to hold on to.”“She used to think love was like a house. Once it was built, a person got to live in it forever. But now she wondered if love was more like a war with new foes constantly appearing and battles creeping up.”“All Evangeline cared about was that she was going to forget about him.”
