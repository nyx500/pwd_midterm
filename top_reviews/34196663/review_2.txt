its been a long since ive been so obsessed with a couple. kazi and jace are literally everything i want from main characters. i honestly kept getting aelin and rowan vibes from them in this installement, which made me realise how badly i want a crossover novel!regardless, i know this duology is one i am going to be rereading many times in the future. this is just one of those stories that really gets everything right. the plot is super engaging, i would die for any of the characters, and the writing feels like breathing.i sincerely hope MEP writes more series set in this world!â†  5 stars
