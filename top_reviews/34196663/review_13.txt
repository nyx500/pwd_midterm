Re Read #2Re Read #2 with Naomi and Héloïse  💖💖------------------------------“Waiting for someone else to write your history was no way to live. Sometimes it was only a certain way to die.”5⭐AHAHHHHHHHHHI love love love this book. I had soo much fun reading this. I love it soo much<333This is one of my favourite series of all timePlotline Now in love, Jase the Patrei and Kazi the thief return to hell's mouth to bring back peace. But a problem separates them during their journey. Jase now seriously injured and Kazi now a prisoner to a evil king, there seems to be no hope for them to make it out of this safe. Unsure whether the other is alive or dead, Kazi and Jase must keep their wits among their greatest enemies and unlikeliest allies. And all the while, Death watches and waits. Writing“Once upon a time, long long ago, before monsters roamed the earth, all the stars hung quietly in the sky, and great cities of wonder and light reached up to meet them.” The writing in this book is soo much better than the Remnant Chronicles. It was soo beautiful and absolutely entrancing.I really enjoyed it!The beautiful writing helped keep that magical feeling throughout ahh Romance I LOVED IT!!!!!!SOOO MUCHJase and Kazi are super cutee and I love them. Their romance was well built and a healthy relationship.Kazi and Jase's marriage vows were the best. I literally sobbed"Kazi of Brightmist...you are the love I didn't know I needed.You are the hand pulling me through the wilderness,The sun warming my face.You make me stronger, smarter, wiser.You are the compass that makes me a better man.""I love you, Jase Ballenger, and I will for all my days. You have brought me fullness where there was only hunger,You have given me a universe of stars and stories,Where there was emptiness.You've unlocked a part of me I was afraid to believe in,And made the magic of wish stalks come true."Jase and Kazi were really great in this book. There's a lot of character development which I adored.I seriously have no idea what to say other than I loved all of them.I loved how brave they both were! They both worked hard to save each other. They were even ready to die for each other. That level of love omg I diedEven though they face problems, they never once whined or never once thought about giving up. They fiercely love their families and I fiercely love them🥺💖Paxton are u my fav character????He is definitely in the top with Jase. why do I love ehim?
