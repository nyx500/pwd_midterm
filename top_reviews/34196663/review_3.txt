PERFECTION. I loved this book. I have absolutely no complaints and I hope that Mary E. Pearson plans to write more books in this fantastic world that she’s created. I’m going to miss Jase and Kazi SO MUCH. I stand by my opinion that Pearson is the most underrated author in YA. You're all sleeping on her brilliance and it's a bloody shame. :(
