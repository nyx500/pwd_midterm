(disclaimer: I went through a literal reading slump after having read one page of this book because my silly goofy brain didn’t want to read (not the books fault at all, only my brains!) (--_--), so in reality the date read should be like dec 23, 2022- dec 31, 2022)this book was actually so incredible, I truly loved every second of it! I felt a bundle of emotions with this book, I felt sad, mad, worried, shocked, and happy, but mostly happy (´◡`).besides going through an unnecessary and lame slump because of my brain, I couldn’t put this book down. the whole universe this series takes place in is so interesting and just enjoyable, you really feel like you’re there. this was a great end to the duology, I’ll admit after the first book I had no idea what the second book would hold, and let me tell you, there are plot twists and surprises that had my heart racing and just so many twists and turns, I loved it!I love the way mary e. pearson writes, it’s so detailed yet not overwhelming, it’s simple yet holds so much, it just has me entranced with every word. hands down one of the best fantasy series I’ve read :D. I love kazi and jase, (def a fav couple of mine now) their love story was beautiful and made me want to sob at times I’ll admit-what a great read and finish for this duology, 5/5 for this book and overall 5/5 for the duology!“Who will write our story, Jase?”“We will, Kazi. You and I will write our own story.”literally me: ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ
