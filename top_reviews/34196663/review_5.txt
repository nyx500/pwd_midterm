🎧 2nd read, Nov. 2021 — 5 starsno words, just more feels. <3📚 1st read, Aug. 2019 — 5 stars#1 Dance of Thieves — 5 starsim so overwhelmed with emotions rn. all of them culminating to one, indescribable something. the one that feels like you just walk through the gates of heaven after braving a rollercoaster journey through hell. not that reading this book in any way felt like being in hell. things were just so twisty & turny, intense, violent, and bloody engrossing. the ending had me joyously sobbing.i know this is such a generic response readers tend to have upon finishing a beloved book. but i spoke of the truth. i felt greedy when i was reading it. like i wanted to know everything asap, and i was racing through it with one sweep of my eyes across the pages. despite all the chaos of emotions i had to juggle during my reading of this book, i want to experience this duology all over again.
