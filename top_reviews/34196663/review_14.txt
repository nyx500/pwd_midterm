After reading and devouring Dance of Thieves, I started Vow as soon as I got it in my greedy hands.I love love love Kazi and Jase. I love how they’re strong on their own, but even better and stronger together. I love their banter and sweet swoons and basically everything between them.Plot wise, man...I wasn’t ready at all. This is a roller coaster of kissing and fighting and stabbing and explosions and treachery. Throw in a couple of surprising reveals and character appearances and I didn’t know what to do with myself.Overall, it was a phenomenal story that was equal parts maddening and satisfying. Huge thanks to Mary for these amazing books.**Huge thanks to Henry Holt for providing the arc free of charge**
