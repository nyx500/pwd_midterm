Considering how much I loved the first book, I was kind of disappointed with this sequel 😢 I really struggled between 2 and 3 stars but am leaning more towards not enjoying this so am going with 2 stars.🆗 I THOUGHT THE BOOK was well-paced and had a lot of exciting things happening, but it also felt a little too chaotic and disjointed sometimes. The story seemed to introduce random new plot lines without really closing out some of the open plot lines from book #1.✅ I’M STILL VERY impressed by how robust the world and magic system is in this series and I do really like Tracy Deonn’s writing. All the rules can be a little confusing sometimes, but it’s nice to read a book with a world that’s more outside the box❌ THE BREE/NICK/SEL LOVE TRIANGLE was so incredibly disappointing for me. Nick wasn’t even a character for like 90% of the book, yet it still felt like Bree and Nick’s romance made more progress than Bree and Sel’s did. I had such high hopes for Bree and Sel, but the character arc for Sel in this just made me really frustrated. I don’t even care who she ends up with tbh because I’m not particularly passionate about any of them anymore. This book really ruined my Sel ship with how self-destructive both Bree and Sel were acting 🥲❌ THE ACTUAL ROMANCE was disappointing to me too. I expect more from the second book in a series that has such a heavy focus on the romance, even if it’s YA. The romance still felt painfully PG. Any kiss scenes were so mehhhh. I guess I’ve just been spoiled lately with how steamy some of the new YA fantasy-romances have been and I expected this to be similar, but it was not.✅ THE REPRESENTATION and darker themes about racism were still present in this sequel. I would say the racism and discrimination in this book were much less subtle and much more heavy handed than in the first book, which made me root for Bree even harder.❌ BREE’S DECISION AT THE END was really something… it felt completely out of nowhere and seemed to go against everything we’ve learned about root so far 🤔🤔 In general, I felt like Bree’s character was much more annoying in this book and seemed way less logical and way more like a damsel in distressOverall, I was really excited to read this sequel but I think my excitement with this series has kind of died down. I think I’ll still continue and find out how the story ends but I’m definitely not sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the next book to be released.
