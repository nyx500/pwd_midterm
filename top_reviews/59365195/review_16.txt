no spoiler reviewwow. all i can say is wow. after 2 years (and some change) being back in bree’s world was refreshing to say the least. i loved this book! there’s so much raw emotion in this book it’s unbelievable. the grit and will of bree is some of the many attributes i love about her. this book is darker and more complex than legendborn, but with that it also brings so much more understanding of the characters and the world. i found myself laughing, crying, and even raging! i also loved the adventurous tone of this story. it felt like a rollercoaster ride and was so exhilarating i didn’t want to miss a second. there are some parallels i personally made to percy jackson while reading this story (in a broader sense of the fanasty genre) that i LOVED! i mean i was in this book from page 1 to page 551! all in. tracy deonn, thank you for bringing my characters home to me again, but also i have a few words because some scenes made me shake! 5/5 stars. phenomenal work.
