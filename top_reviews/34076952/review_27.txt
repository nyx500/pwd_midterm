" Sometimes the unseen is not to be feared and that those meant to love us most are not always the ones who do.” 
Though I've read the witch of duva before and the too clever fox, the rest are new to me.Ayama and the thorn wood 5 stars The too clever fox 3 stars The witch of Duva 4 stars The soldier Prince 5 stars Little knife 4 stars When water sang fire 3.5 stars I've never been a fan of folklores but Leigh changed that plus I'll read anything she writes and this was incredible. The world building and character development that are like 50 pages long for each story is amazing. It was neither info dumping nor vague it was just perfect.

The first story is my favourite, The stories in this book are more than retellings they are so original you'll wonder why the original work was not this great. The writing is superb and I loved it, I wanted to see how it ends at the same time I want to savor it.
This is the problem with making a thing forbidden. It does nothing but build an ache in the heart. 
The stories are no where near predictable, when I thought I had it figured out, the ending will just leave me dumbfounded.
Remember that to use a thing is not to own it.
