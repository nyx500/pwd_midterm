UPDATE: $2.99 on Kindle US today 2/2/19My October 2017 Fairyloot! I added a link below this picture if you want to go see close-ups of the goodies =) ♥ CLOSE UP PICSThese stories were awesome. Well, one that I read when it was free on Tor I only gave 3 stars because of the hunting but other than that, they were pretty dark and cool! I'm just going to add pictures of the postcards I got in my Fairyloot box because these are the same pictures they have after the story has been told. And let me tell you, all of these pictures on the postcards and through-out the book are amaze balls! AYAMA AND THE THORN WOODThis one is my favorite. It's a telling of the not beauty and the beast =) It's wicked and cool! THE TOO- CLEVER FOXThis is the one with too much animal killing. I gave it three stars in my original review because it had some tales within tales THE WITCH OF DUVAThis one is really dark and cool. The woodsman who has a secret. His daughter who befriends a witch and some ewww involved! LITTLE KNIFEThis one is about a girl too beautiful to even behold. A bunch of idiots. And a river =) THE SOLDIER PRINCEThis one is another take on the Nutcracker. Like I have said before, I have not read the original Nutcracker but this one is really good as well. WHEN WATER SANG FIREThis one is about some mermaids. THE END! Don't y'all love my short little explanations? =D I loved the book, it's absolutely beautiful inside and out. The pages are stunning and each page is colored as well. I would recommend to anyone that love the author and fairy tales, myths and folklore! Happy Reading! Mel ♥
