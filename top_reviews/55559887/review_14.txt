That ending was so devious! Some authors I am willing to read YA for and Naomi Novik is definitely one of them. I very much enjoyed this magic school that literally is attempting to kill the students (or protect them?), so Iâ€™m interested to see what happens next. Especially with that very YA cliffhanger ending.
