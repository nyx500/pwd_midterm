TW: gore & body horrorI didn’t enjoy this quite as much as the first installment but it did start to pick up more by the end. It definitely has some middle book syndrome. I continue to enjoy the world building in this series but that’s mainly all the first half was. But it does set up some interesting things for the final book. Warning: this book ends in a massive cliff hanger!
