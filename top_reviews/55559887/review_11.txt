DNFed. Sadly the writing style still grates on me - it’s as if to make our main character seem standoffish she has to talk in double the amount of words than is needed. It’s tiring to get through a page at times and sadly I don’t care enough for the characters, plot, or setting to continue. I might return to it eventually but right now I’m just not vibing.
