Sigh, this went from 5 stars to 3 stars. All of the series actually went from 5 to 4.5, etc. I mean I really love these characters. I fell in love with them years ago. I just wanted to go back and listen to them from the library since I traded mine in and see if I wanted to own physical copies again. I do own the Bloodlines series in hardback and those are going to be read next to see if I want to trade them in. Anyway! I’ll get them if they are in a kindle sale. It does make me sad as I loved the idea of these books but I just don’t think I want them on my shelves. I’m hoping I can unhaul the other series as well. I don’t know why I’m sad about. Hell, I might change my mind and get them anyway. Even if there are stupid parts, it’s like having old friends from your past. Hells bells! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
