this was such an incredible fantasy book. the world-building, the lore, and the characters were written so well. it was interesting to read about the different religions and faith in each kingdom. you can tell Samantha Shannon spent so much time on detail and it paid off !! the different kingdoms and povs were so distinct that you don’t even need the chapter heading to tell you where or who you are reading. you just knew bc the author’s writing is that greatthough i feel this book could have been shorter by a few hundred pages, none of the scenes dragged and i was completely mesmerized. the storytelling was beautiful and so incredibly detailed. our characters were easy to care for and therefore you found yourself rooting for their journey from the start. the way love was written !! my favoriteone thing is that i was able to foreshadow all the little plot twists MANY chapters ahead. reading this book always felt like i was watching from a distance. i’d be screaming something like “DON’T TRUST THEM” and you know what the characters would do? trust them😟 you know when you rewatch a movie and realize how obvious who the bad guy was from the start?? that’s how i felt. i wouldn't say adofn's ending was rushed, but i thought it would be more epic considering we had about 750 pages of buildupoverall, i still think this is a great book for fantasy lovers. SO so much lore was in this book and was woven seamlessly. thank you bloomsbury publishing for sending me an arc in exchange for an honest review ♡
