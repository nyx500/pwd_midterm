F U C K. ME. And I 
HATE
 you so much right now, Mr. Kristoff.Literally GTFO. *
screams for days
*(I was going to do a review on my channel, but I'm waiting for the UK edition to arrive so I can show all of you how beautiful it is, so once I do, I'll leave a link to it down below.)I think this book surpassed all of my expectations and brought them up to an all new high. It was so, so good. Again, Jay's writing was excellent, full of buttery prose and lyrical pieces. This time around though, I didn't mind the footnotes. With the first book, I was mildly annoyed and somewhat irritated but then I got used to it and by the time the Godsgrave came around, I was so interested and more invested in the story, I flew through E V E R Y T H I N G. With twice more the action, blood, guts, violence, gore, and badassery, I really recommend you give this series (trilogy) a go. It's bloody fucking awesome and with the twists and unexpected surprises that this book has, your head will literally implode from all the insanity. But really, R E A L L Y, Mr. Kristoff, that cruel, c r u e l, ending.I see you. I see you. And how I hate you (relatively speaking). 5 BLOODY KICKASS STARSArc provided by author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.Twitter | Bookstagram | Youtube |
