i need new letters to create new words, because there are not enough in all the languages combined that can describe how i feel about this book and series. i never thought i would love something that is so ruthless, so unapologetic, and so downright disturbing. but yet, here i am, giving it all the stars in the world. please send psychological help. because i am desperately close to selling my soul to whatever shadow creature will take it in order to get my hands on book three. 2019 feels like the end of time. â†  4.5 stars
