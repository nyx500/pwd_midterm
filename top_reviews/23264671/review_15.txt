4.5 starsThat's right, folks. We've transitioned from assassins to gladiators!Now, some of you will (like me) love this, but some of you? Ehhhhh. Maybe not so much...Personally, I loved the way Kristoff mixed it up this time around. There was pseudo-Roman empire feel to the setting of the story in the first book, so (to me) this was a natural progression of that same story. But I can see how some might find the transition jarringbecause my mind doesn't 
automatically
 translate ninja assassins into gladiators, either.Regardless of the setting, I felt like Mia's character remained consistent, and that was really the most important thing for me. I thought the change in scenery was an extremely interesting pivot for a second book to take and, to me, the story benefitted from it quite a bit. Again, that's just my personal take on it. Speaking of personal preferences, for those who found the sillyish footnotes annoying and/or weird? If you didn't like them before, you probably still won't like them. BUT. <--and I have no data to back this upIt seemed like there were less of them this time around. Now, considering the fact that I did like them and thought they were a funny way to break up any monotony, you may want to take that with a grain of salt. I wasn't exactly taking notes for my extensive data collection about the footnotes. So how does Mia end up fighting in an arena?Well, she sells herself into slavery, of course!And why the fuck would she ever do something like that?Well, I'm sure as hell not going to tell you. I mean, that would ruin the story, don't you think? What I can tell you is that Mia continues to be a badass, the old and new characters continue to be amazingly 3 dimensional, and the plot continues to thicken.Highly recommended.
