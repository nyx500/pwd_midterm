What was that cliffhanger?! Damn it. Can't wait to start with  The War of Two Queens.  üò©Now before y'all JLA fans start judging me for rating it three stars. Hear me out.. Take FBAA and take this book. Read it simultaneously and you'll see my point. While the writing has improved in this book (by a lot), the plot is essentially the same as FBAA. It wasn't unique. It was very predictable. The pacing was slower, but it picked up in the last hundred pages, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  ‚ùåPOTENTIAL MINOR SPOILERS‚ùå   The Similarities-  1. The story revolves around a  Maiden  who have been trained to fight. Though, they both are very likable, I find Poppy to be better. She has much more character and personality to herself but to be fair to Sera, she doesn't have three-four books to herself..yet. 2. A love interest who meets the FMC under a pretense. Both Casteel and Nyktos tho are highly likable. But with slight differences to their personality. While Casteel likes to follow, Nyktos leads. Both of them call their girls  Princess.  So much for originality, right? 3. The banter is the exact same recipe in FBAA. Though I will definitely say this book handled questioning and communication better in the sense that in FBAA, JLA uses questions as a means to keep the storyline moving. Here, it's done in a bit more flexible manner, instead of completely depending on the characters, she focuses more on the other factors (environmental, inner monologues, etc), which was a nice change to see. I definitely liked the ending, gives me something to be eager about.While it was a decent read, it didn't amaze me. Sorry JLA fans, I know how much you guys love this book. But it is what it isü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èLooking forward to starting with the "controversial" GR book- TWOTQ.
