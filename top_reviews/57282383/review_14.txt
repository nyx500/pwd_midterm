4.5 stars i do find that this book had a lot of similarities to the from blood and ash book but in a way that history repeats itself and not an exact copy of it. i hope that is JLA intentions with this story because i do find that she has a habit of being repetitive. i thought that Sera was very similar to Poppy in the way that she was always so curious and asking questions and kind of both that they don’t really have much personality other than having to be strong and knowing to fight but it wasn’t in a way that i was annoyed. i think that this book was a hair away from being too similar to from blood and ash but i didn’t mind that. now on to Nyktos.. omg i loved him, rip to Hawke cus who even is that? what’s a man to a god. Nyktos is definitely my new book boyfriend cus omg… Also i enjoyed reading about the Draken’s and i actually really love this world and the way JLA writes, i do feel like a lot of things could be better but oh well, i still enjoyed it.
