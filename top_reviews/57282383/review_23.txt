Reread #1 (Nov. 2022) - I seem to have unwittingly started a tradition with the books in the Blood And Ash universe. Every time a book releases in the series I get the need to reread everything from the beginning. I'm not mad at it since I do need the refresh because of how much information is packed into understanding the series and everyone involved in the story. Overall, I adored this reread! I think I enjoyed it, even more, this second time around because I knew what to expect and wasn't projecting the original series onto this prequel, its story, and the characters. Onto the next book because that cliffhanger was heartwrenching! ðŸ˜­P.S. I'm totally modifying my original rating of 4 stars to 5 stars because this was just THAT good â™¡________________________Dec. 28th 2021 - My Full ReviewMy Rating: 4 StarsOriginally posted On:

I'm going to be honest about how I didn't really want this series to be a thing in the beginning. After I finished Blood And Ash #3, I understood the need for it. Now that I've finished this book I'm definitely invested in these characters but not as much as I'm invested in Poppy and Casteel.The reason for that is probably due to the overall pacing of this story when compared to the Blood And Ash books. This one was more on the slow starting and eventually steadied pacing, while Blood And Ash started off slow but quickly became action-packed with very small resting periods. You could say that my brain comparing this book to Blood And Ash kind of took away from this book and you'd be right.Sera was a bad*ss and I was here for it. She didn't take anyone's BS and stood up for what she understood as right. She helped the people in her city to the best of her abilities while feeling overwhelming guilt due to what she perceived she would be responsible to fix. I liked her quite a bit and can't wait to see what happens next!Nyktos wasn't who I was expecting him to be. I think I projected Casteel on him too much and ended up being completely wrong. Nyktos is relatively soft-spoken and level-headed. You really need to do something extreme to get him riled up enough to actually raise his voice. He's not sarcastic and isn't telling a joke every other minute to lighten the mood. Once I accepted him for who he was it was smooth sailing for me.The dire ending really hurt but not as much as I was expecting it to. I'm really interested in knowing how it all plays out. I can't wait to see Nyktos figure out how wrong he is when it comes to Sera. I would also really appreciate novellas or novels *fingers crossed* about some of the Draken that work with Nyktos finding love in the future!The Audio Book:The narration was fantastic! It made this 25-hour monster of a book go by SO DAMN FAST. The characters were distinguishable from each other and there were no weird noises in the background of the recording.________________May 4th 2021Ok. I take back what I said last month. After finishing Blood&Ash #3 I understand the need for this book. I'm very intrigued and ready to have my heart ripped out for the billionth time, Thanks.________________April 26th 2021*Screams*It. Has. A. COVER!And it's SO DAMN beautiful!AND it's about Nyktos. Not something I thought we were going to get right now but I can go with the flow. Is it bad that right this second I would prefer Book #4 in the Blood And Ash Series because I want more Cas, Kieren and Poppy in my life? I'm still excited about this though! I hope this is just as intense as the Blood And Ash Series ðŸ˜­________________March 14th 2021*Deep Breath**Deep Breath**Deep Breath**Deep Breath*AHHHHHH! The prequel! It's almost here! â™¡
