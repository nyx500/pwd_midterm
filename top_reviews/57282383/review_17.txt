“You’re not unworthy. You’re not a curse or anything like that. You carry the ember of life in you. You carry hope within in you. You carry the possibility of a future.”I really liked this book! This was a romantic and intriguing fantasy about power, loyalty, love and betrayal. This book follows Sera as she accepts a deal with the Primal of Death to become his Consort and save her people from a Rot that is destroying her land. She must make the Primal of Death fall in love with her and then kill him. Along they way she learns about her powers and must make a difficult decision.This book is told from Sera's point of view. The world building was excellent, I loved learning about this unique world of gods, drakens, Primals, magic, vampyrs and more. The pacing was inconsistent, in the beginning the pacing was slow, then the pacing was fast and then it slowed down again. The plot was interesting, but at times it was a bit boring. In the beginning I had a hard time connecting with Sera, but once I got to know her I ended up really liked her. Sera is strong, brave, reckless at times, loyal, fierce, and unpredictable. I love Nyktos so much, he is kind, intelligent, extremely attractive, strong, and loyal to his people. I really liked the side characters especially Ezra, Aios, Nektas and Bele. I loved the banter between Nyktos and Sera and their chemistry was amazing. I really felt a connection between them. The spice was very hot and the sexual tension was so good. The character development was excellent, I loved seeing a different side of Nykots and Sera. I really liked how descriptive the writing was. The ending was so good and surprising! I can't wait for the next book! I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, excellent world building, great romance, and intriguing characters.
