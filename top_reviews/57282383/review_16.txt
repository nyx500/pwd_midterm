Rating: 2 or 2.5 stars~ Pick this up if you enjoy/don’t mind the following ~📘 From Blood and Ash series🖤 If you were obsessed with Poppy and Hawke, then you’d love Sera and Ash because they are so similar in character and their romance (perhaps too similar) ❤️ Not quite insta love, but the romance developed very fast 🔥 Hot chemistry, smut and spice! 🐢 Slower pace. Picks up a tad in the second half. ~ What I enjoyed ~I enjoyed the first and last 10% when there was more happening and when some of the mystery was explained.~ What I didn’t enjoy ~Ah gosh there is a lot I didn’t enjoy and considering the length I was relieved to finish it!This could be seen as a positive to some, but this was TOO similar to “From Blood and Ash”. For example: - Sera & Poppy and Hawke & Ash had the same personalities and even the use of nicknames for Hawke and Ash. - The fact that Sera and Poppy were trained by a guard and they have a treasured knife. - The romance and interactions. There was the similar playful type banter and there was too much mention of stabbing!! This was far too long! The first half or two thirds was boring. There were some interesting scenes but outside of them it was so dull and it didn’t feel like there was an overarching plot. The scenes would happen but then nothing would follow afterwards and it was only revisited at the end. I wish there was more of Ash at the start, I almost forgot about him.I was anticipating the ultimate betrayal, the opportunity that would force Sera to make the impossible decision. But sadly that never came. It all came out during a very civil conversation and there were no consequences when Sera’s mission came to light. The only consequence was some passby comments questioning her intentions. There was no character development, especially Sera, she was more or less the same the whole way through. Also I don’t remember any of the side characters. I could not take the word Lasania seriously. Did anyone else notice Lasania vs lasagne?
