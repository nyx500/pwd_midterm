5 stars 🗡i really sat down, ready to write this review, thinking i would be able to formulate a single thought from the ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE NOTES i highlighted during my reading periodso, please allow me to give a non-spoiler, summary of the plot (which is likely better than the spoiler section of the review) with the purpose of somehow getting someone to read this masterpiece.sera mierel (h) is the daughter of the king and queen of lasania. many, many years before she was born, the primal of death made a deal with her ancestor to stop the ‘rot’ killing the land. in exchange for temporarily stopping the rot, the mierel line must give up their first born daughter as a consort (in other words, wife) to the primal of death.primals are rulers with an insane amount of power that rule different courts in the land of the gods. the primal of death is sorta like the devil. he decides if a soul is good or bad and can punish those who are the worst of the worst. in this case, those who hurt our baby sera☺️ back to the plot…sadly, when sera is born, the rot begins to spread for the first time since the deal was struck. this is causing people in lasania to starve slowly. so sera’s family formulates a plan to stop the rot once and for allsera is trained from a young age to the age of 17 to be an assassin. her family believes that the only way to stop the rot from spreading is for sera to become the primal of death’s (nyktos [H] 🥰) weakness so she can kill him. sera is essentially cinderella. she’s hidden away by the world, literally no one but her family and her trainer know her true identity. while cinderella is forced to be a maid to her family, sera’s mom uses her assassin abilities to kill people she feels are threats.now there’s more to the plot, but i feel like this gives a general synopsis that still leaves things that may be surprising to read and discover⭐️ spoilers below ⭐️
nyktos
I WANT TO JUMP THIS MAN’S BONES SO HARD. even when he’s being a dick i’m like give me more please. the first time we meet nyktos is when sera turns 17 and it’s time for her to fulfill the deal and become his consort. well…it didn’t go as planned. nyk pulls up and goes—
“I’m in no need of a consort.”
and dips causing sera to be completely neglected by her mom (like the woman wouldn’t even look at her and they would leave her scraps for food)…ALL CAUSE NYK WANTED TO PLAY HARD TO GETthree years after that, sera is out doing assassin things when she comes across these three gods who kill multiple mortals. well this guy named ash saw her spying and pulled her away before she was spotted.right away I was like ash is clearly nyktos, but for some reason sera couldn’t put two and two together. she describes nyk as having a smoky voice with cold skin and ash has those EXACT things. she even thinks the cliché “he seems so familiar” YEAH NO SHIT one of the hottest scenes in the whole book is when sera is bathing in a lake, naked, and ash happens to be there too 🥰🥰🥰“You still could’ve said something so I wasn’t just standing there—”“Like a goddess made of silver and moonbeams, rising from the depths of the darkest lake?” he finished.please when she rises from the water because she gets pissed off at him—“I doubt you will find me so amusing when you’re gasping for the last of your breaths.”He became still again, and…good gods, the water coursing down his chest froze. The droplets ceased. “I’m already gasping,” he whispered, his voice rougher, deeper.
when they move over to the lake bank and he starts fingering her, i was fucking deceased for EVERY REASON—
“That’s it, liessa, fuck my hand.”[queen]the lake scene is also when sera first realizes NYK IS A VIRGIN 😩😩😩 virgin hero/experienced heroine is MY SHIT. he literally cums in his pants after only TOUCHING her (this is in a later scene hehe)when they finally fuck, it was after he found out sera was sent to kill him and he was injured in battle. well, he needed blood to heal his wounds and the man turned FERAL'
“If you don’t leave, I’m going to feed from you, and I'm going to fuck you while I do it,” he warned.—uhhh sir, do you expect her to complain or somethingwhile he fucks and drinks sera’s blood he says—
“It’s funny because you cannot hurt me…You can never weaken me to the point that you’d ever be a real threat.”
he’s being a PIECE OF SHIT AND IM LIKE 🥵🥵🥵
sera
she’s such a badass omgggg one of my fav scenes is when she brutally murders her stepbrother after he whipped her and nyk came to save her. she made nyk think that she wanted her stepbrother to be spared because her mom begged for his life, but sera only “spared” him so SHE could kill him 🥰I jerked his head back. Wide, panicked eyes met mine as I shoved the handle of the whip into his mouth, pushing it down as hard as I could.this was after she cut his arms off and stabbed him in the chest 😍😍
draken
reaver and jadis were so freaking cute 😭😭 the way jadis would chase after reaver’s tail AHHHHH also reaver is a little draken in this who’s just learned to fly and i wanna cry because he was so hot in TWOTQone of the cutest things was when sera and nyk fell asleep on a couch and sera woke up to jadis sleeping at their feet. she realizes that nektas is also there, nektas is jadis’s dad and one of nyk’s bonded drakens. nektas at this point has been very lowkey and sera hasn’t been able to decide if he likes her or not…but then he says this— “I knew his parents. I called them my friends, and I call Ash one of my own,” he answered, head straightening. His gaze caught mine and held it. “I think I will call you one of my own.”
SCREAMING, CRYING, THROWING UP. I LOVE YOU 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
plot
i know finding out sera is the reincarnation of the woman kolis (the primal of life and nyk’s uncle) was supposed to be shocking, but i realized pretty early on that it was her. basically the second the story was revealed to sera. also, kolis saw “the love of his life” once, ONCE and the whole damn world has to suffer??? the girl got so scared of him that she fell off a fucking cliff and died…like dude take the fucking hint already 😭i'm interesting in how powerful sera is gonna be and is she going to age? because she is at least half human (the other half being primal), but does that mean she’s gonna be an old ass woman in 50 years and nyk will be young af?? obviously that was kinda answered in the blood & ash series, but i'm still interesting in seeing how that plays out 
storytelling
what i really liked about this book more than the blood and ash series, is how little info-dumping there is. there’s nothing i hate more than endless paragraphs of inner dialogue where the MC is trying to figure out what happening or when the only character dialogue is then solving problems they’re facing. like that’s fun, TO AN EXTENTlike this isn’t only fantasy, there’s romance too so the way JLA wrote this book in a way that built the story line AND the romance between nyktos and sera was soo well done. i actually saw someone mention that they hated the amount of dialogue between sera and nyktos…i was like HUH??? don’t you WANT to see their romance progress through their conversations?also, people saying this is the same storyline as BAA have no idea what they're talking about lol. sure there's similarities, but sera is the grandma of poppy...in a way it feels more like history repeated itself with poppy rather than the books being the same due to lazy writing. the writing in this book was better anyway...i found the lore MUCH easier to follow and i now fully understand what a primal is. only took me 5 booksJLA give me book 2 alreadysince i have the worst memory when it comes to book, i literally created a 5 minute voice memo on the entire plot of this book which i’m very proud of 💅🏻
