Holy Bananas!Book Four in the Ranger's Apprentice not only makes up for the lack luster book Three, it left it my fists pumping in the air! Book Three basically set up the events for book Four, in which the ranger Halt and the warrior apprentice Horace were in search of the missing princess Evelyn and the ranger apprentice Will. But enough of the pleasantries and onto the action! Book Four, or the Battle for Skandia, is non stop action. Grab it now and enjoy!
