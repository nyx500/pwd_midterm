My daughter (age 9) and I loved this book. We might have squealed at certain parts. Although I think she got a tad lost while I was reading the battle scenes. Had to stop a few times to explain what was going on or a joke that was worded in a way she didnâ€™t quite understand. But we had a good time reading this one. Looking forward to the next!
