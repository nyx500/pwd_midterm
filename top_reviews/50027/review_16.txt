I should not be surprised that I really loved this book. I have heard the name of Drizzt mentioned many times in conversations regarding awesome characters, but somehow managed to avoid reading this book until now. I'm not sure if I should be sad that I have only discovered this series now, or happy that I have so many wonderful books to look forward to. Upon starting this book I struggled a bit getting to know the world of the drow (why is everyone so evil? Ah, villain POV) and kept wondering what was happening. Luckily this only lasted up until the birth of the main character Drizzt Do'Urden. The story really took off from there and kept me in it up to the ending which I thought could have been a bit more climatic, but is more of a setup/intro for the next book in the series. Luckily I don't have to wait to get my hands on the next one.All in all a very enjoyable read that ticked almost all of the boxes. Loved Drizzt and Guenhwyvar and looking forward to the next book in this series. 4.5 stars!
