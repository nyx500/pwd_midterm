I started this series long ago, but put it down as I wanted to save it for the right occasion. A few weeks of occasionally playing D&D whilst vacationing at home this summer made me absolutely long for it. Spending the remainder of the summer in the middle of the Norwegian mountains with very little I needed to get done, it seemed like the ideal time to go on some adventures with Drizzt.Homeland proved to be exactly what you'd expect from a tie-in novel written by a skilled author. It is well-written and well-constructed, with long streaks of completely unnecessary and uninteresting scenes.Full review to come after I read some more Drizzt books.
