The only way I can explain the love for this book is that people read it when they were 13 and are remembering it fondly. The writing style holds the reader's hand a lot: we're told the motives behind every character's action, instead of having to derive intent from their actions, the narration stops to explain how things work rather than immersing us in the world and letting us figure it out. It's also a binary world: everyone is either evil or good, even entire races are described as "evil" by the narrator.Overall Drizzt is the embodiment of geek wish-fulfillment: an incredibly talented swordsman, who also happens to be amazingly talented in sorcery (so much so that they had a tough time determining which school he should go to). He's the only person with a morality we would recognize in a world of people who see no problem with killing, who worship a spider god, and who only understand violence as a way of life. Oh, he also has a super cool pet panther.One example of how little sense Drizzt makes: the first time he, or any of his underground-dwelling friends, encounter life on the surface, he is somehow the only person who automatically recognizes the sights, sounds, and smells as beautiful. Also, the narrator doesn't try to show us the surface world as it would be experienced by someone who had spent his whole life underground, instead just talks about squirrels, birds, and trees as though Drizzt would know what these things are. Granted it would be hard to write that scene from Drizzt's perspective, but that challenge is the heart of fiction: showing us the world from another's point of view.I think there's a decent story in here and did manage to finish the book, but I think the morality problems in this book need to be handled with a bit more sophistication in order to feel at all real.
