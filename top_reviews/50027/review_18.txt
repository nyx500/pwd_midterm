Homeland is the first book in the Dark Elf Trilogy written by R. A. Salvatore in 1990. The Dark Elf Trilogy is a prequel trilogy before the Icewind Dale Trilogy which Salvatore actually wrote first. When Salvatore wrote the Icewind Dale Trilogy Drizzt Do’Urden was a side character, but fans wanted to know more about the dual sword fighting dark elf. So, Salvatore wrote the origins of Drizzt and boy what a tale!Here’s the chronological order for the first few books (but not all):The Dark Elf TrilogyHomelandExileSojournThe Icewind Dale TrilogyThe Crystal ShardStreams of SilverThe Halfling’s GemLegacy of the Drow SeriesThe Legacy Starless NightSiege of DarknessPassage to DawnHomeland takes place in the Underdark in the city of Menzoberranzan (say that ten times fast). Drizzt is born into an evil society of the drow, or dark elves. It is a matriarchal society but with a dictatorship-like rule. Drizzt was born on the same night his patron mother attacked another drow family in order to increase her power and standing in the ranks of society. Drizzt Do’Urden is not like the other drow who are vicious, double-crossing, demon worshippers. He’s compassionate, loving, and strong with a true sense of right and wrong. Drizzt feels out of place in his own land and craves to find a place to belong.This was a great book and I can’t wait to read the other books in the series! I will get as far in the series as my wallet takes me! I’m hooked! Drizzt is one of my favorite characters in the Fantasy genre. I really love his mix of the “every man” and “superman” traits. He is unbeatable in melee combat, but his tender heart and longing for a place to belong is something we all can relate to. Oh, and Drizzt gets a pet panther! Say WHAT?!?! Yup, its name is Guenhwyvar (if you figure out how to say it let me know). In closing, Homeland is extremely dark and in some places I actually winced because some of the scenes were just plain evil. I guess that comes with the dark fantasy territory right? Putting that aside, the story was exceptional and I really love Drizzt. I hope you will too! Off to book two I go!!!
