I love this fantasy series of Drizzt! I'm slowly getting all of them and as I have been searching there are a lot of them. I'm glad one of my best friends who loves fantasy told me about this series. I don't have the good mind or words to write a big review. You can read what it's about and if you love these kinds of books then this is one for you! All I can say is Drizzt is a dark elf with a good heart!
