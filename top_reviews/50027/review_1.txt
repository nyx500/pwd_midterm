Homeland was the first fantasy book I ever read, and I only read it because it was a Christmas gift and I was bored. But that first copy of this book has now been read so many times, by me and everyone I ever thrust it on to read, that the spine is barely holding together and the cover is threatening to disintegrate. For a dork who really likes fantasy novels, this story was just too engrossing for me to ever stop reading. While I can't say it's a great cultural work or the kind of story everyone should read; it's my literary equivalent of comfort food. And I really love it.
