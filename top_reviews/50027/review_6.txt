5 dark starsI picked this one up out of sheer curiosity because everyone I know was gushing about it. And now I'll be the one doing the gushing because - and I just have to say it - this book is amazing!Drizzt by Rheann on DeviantArtHomeland is a dark cruel place where kindness and compassion are weak and disgracefull traits that need to be eradicated. Love and honour have no place on Homeland, where hate, cruelty and violence rule, burried deep within the bowels of the earth under the strict supervision of the malevolent Spider Queen.Drizzt the art of Todd LockwoodThis world where new born male babies are sacrificed by their own mothers for the favour of the Queen and where children are brought up under the constant bite of snake-headed whips is the home of the young dark elf Drizzt, the hero of this series.Here we get to see how Drizzt grows up and how this dark world shapes the little boy he was into the exceptional young warrior he will become.Drizzt Do√örden by -Akizhao on Deviant artThere are so many great things I could tell you about this book but, as you may have neither enough time nor proper mood to go through it all, I'll just wrap it up and make it short by saying:
I loved loved loved it! And I highly recommend it.
Both young Drizzt and his fierce and loyal four-footed companion have found a place in my heart and I'll make sure I'll follow their adventures to the end.Find this review and more on my book review and cover art blog
