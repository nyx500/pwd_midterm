4.5 stars. I have not read a lot of "Forgotten Realms" novels and did not go into this book with overly high expectations. Well, those expectations were greatly exceeded and I found myself loving it. The character of Drizzt is fascinating and the politcal/social/environmental structure of the drow, or dark elves, was very well thought out and incredibly interesting. I will certainly read the remaining books in this series. Highly recommended.
