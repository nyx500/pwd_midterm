I didn't really know what to expect from this book going in, but I was pleasantly surprised. I really loved learning about the world and the culture of the drow elves. Drizzt is awesome, and I thought the characters were all pretty interesting. The writing style took me a while to get used to. I think sometimes it made me feel disconnected from the novel, but I'm thinking I'll just like the books more and more as I read them and I won't have those disconnection problems going forward.
