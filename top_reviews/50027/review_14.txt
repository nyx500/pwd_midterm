An old school, cool dark fantasy original, unleashing the full sadomasochistic, hierarchical dominatrix style tradition while conjuring around. How important was it?As so often, I am just not, in this case, dark fantasy, prone enough to really know the long term impact, scale, and importance of this work. Or whatever came before or after, but I deem it interesting in the context of evolving real life societies, especially male and female role models, emancipation, and sexism. BDSM Domina(tion)Depending on how one is into certain practices, one can find immense pleasure or confusion and disinclination in this dark fantasy matriarchy turned dominatrix madness. I liked it for the just logical reason of very well written character dynamics and worldbuilding. No, honestly, I´m more the sadistic kind of guy, that´s just not my carrot and stick role allocation.Quick, fast, and easy to read.I´m especially mentioning this because fantasy sadly tends to do endless, confusing exposition until something really substantial happens. Here, one is immediately in the dark grid and gore of the universe without much time to relax while exploring the wackiness. That´s also a reason why it´s a perfect read in between, a satisfying trilogy that doesn´t take too much time to complete it.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...
