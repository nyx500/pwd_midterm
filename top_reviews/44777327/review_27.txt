At long last after all these months and an end of year which kept me busy i finished to read the riyria trilogy. My feeling right now is one of amazement . Michael j sullivan kept me out of breath with this stunning ending. The strong point of this trilogy is definetely the characters and of course the plot. I donâ€™t have enough of hadrian and royce so i going to dive in the prequels right away.
