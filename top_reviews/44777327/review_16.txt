At some point more detailed review might come but so far I will say WOW, just WOW.This series starts as fun little adventure with witty dialogues .In second book we get more worldbuilding, characters get more layers and plot thickens but it's all setting stage for what happens in this book.By far longest of the 3 it's culmination of everything that happens in previous books and I was astonished to see how some small details and side characters had impact later in story.I am also glad Sullivan didn't writer any sequels since this books has very satisfying conclusion and I hate when authors ruin good ending with unnecessary sequels.
