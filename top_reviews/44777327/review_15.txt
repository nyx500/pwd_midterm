4.5* but I am generous this year. "Life is like a bully that gets laughs by seeing how much humiliation you’ll put up with. It threatens to kill you if you don’t eat mud. It takes everything you care about—not because it wants what you have, or needs it. It does it just to see if you’ll take it"Finally! Sullivan finally rises up to the hype. I enjoyed the first two volumes, they were easy fun, but I wasn't as impressed as the many GR fans of the author. I still not believe the 3rd and final volume to be a masterpiece but it was so much better, from all points of view. The author grew and the writing got better with each book, the character became more nuanced, everything came together in the end and there were no boring bits like in the other two. Myron is back which is great. Arista got so much better and I finally fell for Hadrian and Royce (mostly Royce). On the downside, Sullivan can't do romance well. It's ok since it is more of a female author skill but still...I am going to miss those two but no worries because I still have Riyria Chronicles to read. “What is the advantage of fear, or the benefit of regret, or the bonus of granting misery a foothold even if death is embracing you? My old abbot used to say, ‘Life is only precious if you wish it to be.’ I look at it like the last bite of a wonderful meal—do you enjoy it, or does the knowledge that there is no more to follow make it so bitter that you would ruin the experience?”
