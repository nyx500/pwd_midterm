2020- Still got it.2016 reread verdict:I have now officially decided that I will reread this series once a year due to it's excessive kickassyness. Yep. If too much of a good thing is bad for you, then this book is POISON. As Alice Cooper meant to say - "I wanna read you, but I want it too much"Original review:What a great series. Michael J. Sullivan has captured the essence of fantasy and spoiled us with a well written story that ticked all the boxes and more.
