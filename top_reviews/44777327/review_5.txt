I loved ''Theft Of Swords'' and ''Rise of Empire'' and I expected the ''Heir of Novron'' to be truly epic but it wasn't...It was something more, it was something greater, it was mind-blowingly good!Stories like these are the reason I love fantasy. I won't share any details or spoilers because I wouldn't dare to deprive you from fantastic experience of going through it yourself. Some parts reminded me of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' and I loved it because that was the book that made me fall in love with fantasy. ''The Lord of the Rings'', for me, is one the best stories ever written and no other book came close to evoke the way I felt reading it until this one. This book has everything, story has a great flow, the best fantasy duo ever written, great supporting characters that sometimes made me feel like they are the main ones, great villains, great world building that made me feel like I was traveling through Elan and beyond epic story with the best ending I have ever read, the last few sentences left me staring at the book with my mouth open and my mind blown. This whole series was such a grand journey, and when I was finished I had mixed feelings, I was sad that it was over but I was happy that I had this amazing experience and I can't wait to read the prequels. This is one of the best books I've ever read and this series took the number one spot as my favorite.Heir of Novron represents the pure essence of fantasy, it is a book with a heart and soul so if you like fantasy and you haven't started this series yet, I implore you to do so because this is an experience you don't want to miss out!
