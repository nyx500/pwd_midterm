Seventeen-year-old Kiva Meridan was only seven when she was incarcerated, along with her father, in the notorious prison, Zalindov, where no one gained freedom. Kiva was now the prison healer, following in her father’s footsteps after he died, and while the people who sought her help were criminals, Kiva’s destiny was to heal. Beside her was eleven-year-old Tipp, an orphan who Kiva had sworn to look out for to Tipp’s mother. Tipp was an enthusiastic child, always happy to help even while living within the prison walls. When new inmates were brought in, Kiva tended to them, making sure they were healthy, had their number while she carved the Z on the back of their hands. Kiva hated doing that, but had no choice.When a new inmate, along with two others who were already dead, arrived, Kiva couldn’t help but notice the difference in him to normal new inmates. But she knew he wouldn’t last as he’d be set to work in the tunnels. But it was when the Rebel Queen was captured and brought to the infirmary, that Kiva’s real troubles began. With the Rebel Queen very ill, she was set to do the Trial by Ordeal – four different trials; air, fire, water and earth – and Kiva knew she would die, as she hadn’t regained consciousness. With the message to keep her alive, Kiva nominated herself as the person to do the trials in place of the Rebel Queen. Was she mad?! No one had ever survived the trials – she was sure to die…The Prison Healer is the 1st in the Prison Healer Trilogy by Aussie author Lynette Noni and it was brilliant – as is all Ms Noni’s work. The tension, the horrors of the prison, the brutality of the guards and taking care to bury your emotions so as to feel nothing for anyone, not to feel devastated when they inevitably died – all took their toll. I’m really looking forward to #2, The Gilded Cage, very soon. Highly recommended.
