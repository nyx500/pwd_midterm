I really enjoyed this!! 🤩🤩 I went in not sure what I was gonna think, but it was actually a really fun time and exactly what I needed. Such a solid YA fantasy!! 💖💖“Never apologize for loving someone. Even when it hurts. Especially when it hurts.”The Prison Healer follows Kiva Meridan, who works at the notorious death prison Zalindov as its only qualified healer. She has managed to survive there for 10 years by only focusing on one goal: stay alive. But then the Rebel Queen arrives at the prison, deathly ill, and Kiva receives a message: 'don't let her die. We are coming.'There's obviously a lot more to it, but I think going in with limited information would make it so much more fun! It looks like a pretty basic story, but it had much more depth than I expected. And it's also sooo entertaining!! 🤩🤩“Hope was a drug and Kiva, an addict.”Starting with the characters- I really liked the characters in here! Kiva was a really good MC- she had a fighting spirit, but she still experienced a lot of challenges. She had a lot of depth to her and I was a big fan!! 💕 Another big character was Jaren. When he was first introduced, I thought he was gonna be the typical love interest-type character but he surprised me by being a lot more interesting! I really liked him and was a big fan of his and Kiva's dynamic 🥰🥰There were also quite a few good side characters! My favourite was Tipp- he was so sweet and precious and must be protected at all costs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of younger children in books, but Tipp was too cute! 😍😍💞💞The writing and the plot were both great!! ✨ Lynette Noni's writing style was the perfect balance between emotion, action and descriptions, and it was super easy & entertaining to read. Also loved the atmosphere of the prison, which was such an interesting setting! The plot too was done really well- it was paced perfectly! There was always something to keep you interested. And the twists and turns at the end- one wasn't that hard to guess, but the way it was revealed plus some other twists really shook me! 🤯🤯Lastly, the romance. It was cute!! Pretty typical for a YA fantasy, but still very sweet and I did feel the chemistry. I definitely liked them as a couple. It also wasn't overwhelming to the plot, which I appreciated. I don't think I would recommend the book FOR the romance, but it was a cute little subplot! 🥰🥰“So you’re right, you don’t need me fighting your battles. But if you’ll let me, I’d like to be standing beside you as you fight them.”The only negatives had were that a main part of the plot were these trials- and if I'm being completely honest, they were kinda lame. Like they could've been sm better!! *sigh* 😒😒 I also thought the magic system needed a lot more fleshing out, but i guess that's part of the reason it's part of a trilogy 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️“Our scars define us. They tell a story of courage and survival. They tell of who we are at our deepest being, of the challenges we've faced and overcome”Overall, a really fun read!! 🤩🤩 I would definitely recommend if you're looking for:✔ Fast-paced plot✔ Unique setting✔ Great writing and characters✔ A fun YA fantasyIt was really enjoyable and I'm definitely interested in picking up the sequel!! 💗💗~ 4 stars~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This was sooo good!! 🤩🤩 Such a fun time 💖💖 also I'm still reeling at the ending-- 🤯🤯RTC!
