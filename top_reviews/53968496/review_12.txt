Five bright shining stars! What a fantastic read! Noni's writing created a vivid and immersive world that is both terrifying and captivating.The main character, a seventeen-year-old Kiva Meridan, was a skilled healer who was imprisoned in the notoriously brutal Zalindov prison. Kiva was sentenced to life imprisonment for a crime she did not commit, and spent her days tending to the sick and injured prisoners, while trying to keep her own secrets hidden.The other characters in the book are also well-developed, each with their own unique backstory and motivations.The word-building was immersive and the plot was exciting, engaging and full of surprises, I was hooked from the beginning to end. And, that cliffhanger in the end? Wow!
