An excellent start to what I believe is going to be a trilogy. Definitely a duology at least because book two already has a title and a cover.I am currently part way through the Akarnae series but when I saw the blurb for The Prison Healer I could not resist it. And it is a good one. My only criticism is that it is too long and the middle section tends to drag as a result. However everything else is really good.The story is set in an inescapable prison where people tend not to survive the conditions for very long. Kiva has been there for ten years since she was seven and, as she is a healer, she has avoided the worst the prison offers. She also has occasional contact from the outside world which causes her to believe she will one day be rescued. As events turn out she has to save herself in several very dramatic ways.It is a good story, the characters are interesting and Noni writes it well. Then there is the ending which is beyond brilliant. I never saw it coming at all, and of course it means I will be grabbing book two just as soon as I can.My thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read and review this book
