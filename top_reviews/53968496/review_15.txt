Very solid book and I'm excited to pick up the next one!‚úÖ I THOUGHT THE SETTING was unique for a YA fantasy book. Pretty much the entire story took place in a Prison.. but it felt like its own community (albeit a pretty terrible community) and I just really liked reading about it‚úÖ THE STORY ITSELF was really exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat, always wanting to find out what happens next! There was an appropriate amount of mystery but you still got some answers, especially at the end!‚úÖ THE ENDING was so amazing! So many exciting things happened in the last 20% of the book and I could not stop reading! I'm really happy I had a physical copy because the black pages towards the end were a really nice touch too. And that cliff hanger - ahhhh I love this type of storyline so much! Undercover badass üòè‚ùå MY LEAST FAVORITE part was the trials and tasks that Kiva had to do. I found the way each task was resolved to be wayyyy too convenient. Kiva didn't actually do anything to solve any of the tasks... she was basically just along for the ride.üÜó THE ROMANCE was okay. I definitely liked Jared and thought their interactions were cute, but it is definitely a YA romance so don't expect anything more than a couple stolen kisses, etc.Overall, I really enjoyed this book and am going to start reading the next one asap once I get it! I just love where this storyline is going and I can't wait to find out what happens next.
