The Wise Man's Fear by Patrick Rothfuss(Kingkiller Chronicle,#2)As a middle book of the series, this book is incredible. Adored the story, the magic system, and the world Patrick has created. The thing I felt is if you love fast-paced books, you may not like this book.And such an actorish narrator Rupert Degas is!! I can only appreciate Rupert Degas for excellent and in-depth storytelling. No doubt, the narrator had a special care for the characters.Anyone can love a thing because. That's as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something despite. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect.Beautiful experience.
