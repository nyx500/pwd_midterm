The Wise Man’s Fear is the second book in the Kingkiller Chronicle series with the first book being The Name of the Wind. In this book, Kvothe is sitting around his inn telling the story of his adventures as a young man. He speaks of his time at the university, a journey in Vintas, leading a group of mercenaries, and a stint with Felurian.This book was not as good as The Name of the Wind—the storytelling was off. The first book was amazing. It was like sitting around a campfire and hearing an amazing epic tale. However, large portions of this book were boring. One scene that was profound was when Kvothe was at the university, and his teacher Elodin wrote a list of books on the board. The students asked Elodin what books that they should read, and he responds, “How should I know? I haven’t read these.” Most of the books turn out to be pointless. This encouraged some noodling on my behalf because when I was at university the professors set a course list for the term. However, it would have been so much more meaningful if the professors taught us to look for truth and discuss lots of different books with each other than spoon feed us books that we may or may not like and have no ability to switch to a different book. Further, many of my professors wrote their own course material and charged us for it. I sincerely doubt that this was the best material to learn from.Kvothe finally leaves the university and journeys to Vintas. While going to Vintas, the book essentially states that some exciting things happened, but Kvothe won’t go into it now. This section of the book was so clumsily written--It is embarrassing. Now, in the interest of full disclosure, my favorite author (leave in the comments below if you know the name of my favorite author) will write short stories to supplement his main works. But the transition is smooth, subtle. The Wise Man’s Fear was not smooth. It was very annoying. I would have had more respect for this section of the book if it was just a fade to black, and Kvothe arrived in Vintas. When Kvothe was leading the mercenaries, this section of the book was boring. Additionally, Kvothe essentially just traded one version of school for another. When Kvothe is selecting his new sword, JK Rowling should get some royalties because it was just like when Harry was selecting his wand. Kvothe went from being an “innocent” boy, and then he meets Felurian and all that goes out the window. Felurian was so lame by the way. I struggle to understand the appeal. She might be beautiful, but she doesn’t sound very interesting. She is a poor storyteller, and she doesn’t appear to be very smart especially given her age. Kvothe was then after anything with a skirt. Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew. Just so you know Kvothe, you don’t have to say yes to every single person who shows an interest in you. If 5 out of 100 are diseased according to Kvothe, he definitely has something he can’t wash off. Overall, this book was a disappointment when compared to the first book. 2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones’s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta
