EDIT:So, I've decided to change my rating to 5 stars. How can I not when the story is so epic and my attachment to Kvothe keeps growing?! Original review: Not sure whether to rate this 4 or 5 stars yet, but I think I'll end up probably changing it to 5. There's something about these stories that you know will stay with you for a while. The more you think about it, the better it becomes. And the more you begin to love and appreciate it. I definitely preferred this instalment to the first book. Though slow-burning it was, I remember getting slightly bored with the first book at times. This sequel, however, I experienced it only for a moment, and for the behemoth of a book it is, I was surprised by that. It was slow in the best possible way. The pacing was right on! It's so intricate and so detailed and you can tell that so much effort has gone into placing and choosing every word. There's so much love behind it!This book carried right from where it left off when the first book ended, and I love that addition to the story. It's such a unique point. Just a continuation of the story. Literally, the next day. The world is bigger and better and there's so much Rothfuss explores and adds to this incredibly, magical story. The writing is impeccable and beautiful and delicious and it carries you to its world and fully draws you in. It's an absolute joy to read. I fell in love with Kvothe even more and I'm dying to see how his story will conclude and how Rothfuss will make it come round full-circle. There's still so much mystery and sadness surrounding the main character and how he came to be the man he is now and quite frankly, I'm terrified that something will happen to him. Just give us the third book already. We beg of you.
