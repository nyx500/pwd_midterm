Patrick Rothfuss's The Wise Man's Fear is a great continuation (book #2) of the KingKiller Chronicle. We learn much about the precocious young wizard, Kvothe, and we get more of a feel for the conflicts and turmoil of the present from which Kvothe tells his story. I kept asking myself, "How is Rothfuss going to resolve that?" I am now one of the seeming legion who are anxiously (patiently?) awaiting the final installment of the trilogy. I'm just not sure how he can do it in one book (even a big fat fantasy book)! But while, in terms of story, the book advanced our understanding of our protagonist and made us anticipate/contemplate what is to come, I didn't come away feeling like this book had blown me away. I really enjoy Rothfuss's writing, but Kvothe's adventures seemed a bit too episodic and more drawn out than necessary. However, I am still convinced that this is a great series. I am rounding up from a 4.5 to 5.
