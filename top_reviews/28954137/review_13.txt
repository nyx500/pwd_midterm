THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!! I LOVED IT SO MUCH!! This is saying a lot because TMI took me over two years to finish. Simon has always been my favorite character and I loved having him as the main focus. I also loved reading about The Last Hour characters and seeing a glimpse of what's to come in The Dark Artifices. Also, the ending hurt me so much??? Like how could u do that to meeee???
