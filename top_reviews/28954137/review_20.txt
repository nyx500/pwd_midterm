5/5 â˜† i'm a mess of emotions. i didn't realize but there are a ton of (i guess you could say) side characters i didn't fully appreciate or understand until reading these novellas and i'm so happy my perspective changed. it shows there are more sides to a person you may think.i'm also surprised by how strongly i appreciated the themes. these novellas are mostly about finding who you are and what YOU want. i fohnd that really surprising because most novella collections are just compilations of "fan-fiction-esque" writings and lack depth. all these stories had a moral and made me love the shadowhunter world even more than i already do. another thing i loved about this collection was that it didn't feeeeeeel long (which, it is quite long) or disconnected. i usually have a hard time getting into novellas because they're so short and don't connect together into one cohesive story, but TALES FROM THE SHADOWHUNTER ACADEMY was not the case. it felt like one whole book split into 12 parts instead of 12 parts put together as a book.///FULL REVIEW + DISCUSSION (maybe) TO COME///
