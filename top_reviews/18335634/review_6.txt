☆☆☆☆☆5 BEST I HAVE EVEN GIVEN STARS!☆☆☆☆☆
Clockwork Angel Review!Clockwork Prince Review!I have finished this book for about 3 hours ago and I still can't believe the series is over.This pure perfection,this amazing thrilling story,this everything.I have been so caught up with this series these past two weeks and I don't want this to end.I consider myself a fool for not reading this before,for listening to people who told me to not even bother to try this.I can't imagine how can people dislike this,with it's perfectly plot and characters and the awesome writing.At least show respect for this great,beyond good novel.____________________________________________

“You endure what is unbearable, and you bear it. That is all.” 

____________________________________________This is my favorite series of 2014,maybe my all time favorite.I know I will read other awesome books,books I will love and cheer but this one,the whole series actually,will always have a space in my colossal vitality of imagination.____________________________________________

“Tessa craned her head back to look at Will. “You know that feeling,” she said, “when you are reading a book, and you know that it is going to be a tragedy; you can feel the cold and darkness coming, see the net drawing tight around the characters who live and breathe on the pages. But you are tied to the story as if being dragged behind a carriage and you cannot let go or turn the course aside.” His blue eyes were dark with understanding — of course Will would understand — and she hurried on. “I feel now as if the same is happening, only not to characters on a page but to my own beloved friends and companions. I do not want to sit by while tragedy comes for us. I would turn it aside, only I struggle to discover how that might be done.”“You fear for Jem,” Will said.“Yes,” she said. “And I fear for you, too.”“No,” Will said, hoarsely. “Don’t waste that on me, Tess.” 

____________________________________________The writing style is perfect.This series is written in third person,but yet I couldn't help but admire the writing.The greatness lies in the way author has collided the quotes of classics with the chapters,the time the book is written with the way they speak,the manners and habits with the characters' personality.Everything clings perfectly.____________________________________________

“Sometimes one must choose whether to be kind or honorable," he said. "Sometimes one cannot be both.” 

____________________________________________This series has made me not just respect,but admire poetry.Also I dig the series so much because the characters talk books,in their unique ways,talk books as they were part of their lives,talk books as they are a treasure worth having.____________________________________________

“I am catastrophically in love with you.”

____________________________________________Clockwork Princess is a beautiful,yet thrilling sequel with everything in it.The characters are fully developed and it reflects the plot and the lives,intentions,desires and dreams of characters.Also you can feel and see them being free and finally choosing what they truly want,what they truly are.____________________________________________

“It has been the privilege and the honor of my life to know you.” 

____________________________________________And as the other books,this one contains the sense of humor I likely want to read in novels.It comes so natural and freely,especially with Will,he is the master of jokes.____________________________________________

“And now I need you to do for me what I cannot do for myself. For you to be my eyes when I do not have them. For you to be my hands when I cannot use my own. For you to be my heart when mine is done beating.” 

____________________________________________I can't part this book.I enjoyed every word and chapter.The beginning was thrilling because the second book ended with a cliff,the middle also exciting because something happens and you can't help but read more and more,and the ending because it's perfection.The best ending ever written.And I am talking about the epilogue.____________________________________________

“Do not seek revenge and call it justice.” 

____________________________________________So the epilogue.I don't want to spoil anything but this is the best epilogue ever written.I read it in one breath.It's the most emotional part of the whole series and it's the reality of the characters,the ones we grew up to love and respect.____________________________________________

“Most people are lucky to have even one great love in their life. You have found two.” 

____________________________________________The story continues with the institute and the Cecily arrival.With the Magister gone who knows where with his intentions, the shadowhunters are faced with a lot of problems they don't have the knowledge to fix.Tessa,now as Jem's fiancee is still trying to know herself,and her heart.Will she,being the last piece in the Magister's evil plan,save the Institute and her family there or be their destruction?____________________________________________

“There are so many worse things than death. Not to be loved or not to be able to love: that is worse.” 

____________________________________________

I want to mention some of my favorite moments in this book(This contains spoilers so if you haven't read the book,skip this part)

I really liked when Will rides the horse up to the hills.I could visualize it with all the background,the horse running,the air pumping.It reminded me of some of my childhood animation movies and I dig those times so much.____________________________________________

“There is more to living than not dying.” 

____________________________________________I also liked all the scene with Cecily,especially the one with her in the back of the worm.It was a badass move,and the whole scene was full of action and excitement.____________________________________________

“Atque in pepetuum, frater, ave atque vale,” he whispered. The words of the poem had never seemed so fitting: Forever and ever, my brother, hail and farewell.”

____________________________________________And of course the scene with Tessa turning into the angel and crushing the Magister. Beside chills ,it gave me lots of joy because the madman was finally dead.____________________________________________

“For this I would be damned forever. For this I would have given up everything.” 

____________________________________________
The characters

Tessa
Tessa is one of my favorite main characters.She is strong,determined and caring and sometimes I could see her sense of humor.She has developed so much and she has proved herself to be a faithful person.Also at her age she handles greatly the affections with pride and loyalty.
Will
Will has also all the great qualities a man should have,but what I liked about him was that he doesn't play the perfect innocent person.I must say the way he handled the situation with the curse was to be admired.Also the humor,even though I can't understand why he hates ducks!
James
Jem,as Will contains the best qualities a person could contain,and also because of that and the fact that he is dying and he perfectly handles that makes you idol this character.
Cecily
I was introduced to this character in the third book,but I truly like her.She is carefree and she talks without hesitations.Also she is one hell of a badass chick and the way she talks is so fun to read.____________________________________________

“At last, the wheel comes full circle” 

____________________________________________I highly recommend this series to every reader out there.It's everything you wish to find in a book and gives you a new way to see the world.I personally hesitated to read this one but now I regret only one thing,that I haven't picked this one before.I learned so much from this and for that I am truly grateful.____________________________________________

“One does no question miracles, or complain that they are no constructed perfectly to one's liking.”
