I'm going to curl into a corner and cry now, that was beautiful ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Which is exactly what i did for the first two days after reading this book, then i got off the ground and began trying to draw what I imagined Tessa would look like. Needless to say it was not a very satisfying coping mechanism, but it worked to a certain extent. This book was everything a person could want in a book, interesting, fast paced, action filled, and most of all emotionally wrecking. Lets talk characters, Will, Will, Will, im in love with Will!!!! I think i become so emotionally invested in fictional characters, i'm starting to lose my ability to connect with real life human beings. Not complaining though, TBH. James was a sweetheart, but im always the bad boy lover. All the side characters were purely lovable, i think i shipped Cecy and Gabriel so much, while giggling over Gideon and Sophie. oh and charlotte and henry!!!!!!!!! basically lets just name everyone in the book one by one and then ill be satisfied!!!!!!I just wish to complain a little about Tessa's absolute lack of self competence. I mean if the intention was for to be an absolute damsel in distress, she nailed it. Which frankly was a little irritating given that I'm very strongly attached to strong female characters. But given how much i loved this book im willing to forgive it.I was a little again irritated with the fact that the last few chapters of this book dragged on a bit, but when the prologue finally arrived i was bent over literally suffering from tachycardia from how emotionally distraught the book made me. I cried and laughed, and felt my heart squeeze in and over itself so many times i was physically breathless once it was over!THERE IS A SPINOFF SERIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN COMING IN 2019!!!!!!!!!! HOW IN THE NAME OF THE GOOD LORD AM I SUPPOSED TO WAIT THAT LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
