"I'm not a certified idiot."
This is going to come off as the same rant I've made after first three books of MI, but I don't know what else to say. It felt like the same thing for the most part in a different time line, with a different set of names. Another annoying love triangle, and another set of uninterestingly obvious characters. Take away the romance, the repetitive facial descriptions of the same people over and over again, and you end up with a very simple and short story without even a strong main plot.At least Mortal Instruments had a bit of mystery and suspense going for it, with the concept of shadowhunters being new and everything, but I couldn't see Infernal Devices any other way than the same thing wrapped up differently. When it comes to fantasy, there should be a certain amount logic behind things, especially when used tech-aspects to have at least some adherence to timelines. Clare had thrown both out of window. Sure, such 'unbelievable' imagination could work in favor at times, but it certainly didn't work here. There was simply no harmony between different aspects of the plot, and the author had gone for sheer entertainment over quality.I've come to the world of Shadowhunters from Jack Vance's Lyonesse, which had been the best surprise of the year for me, only to find the best disappointment in Cassandra Clare's MI and ID. Still, I've kept going through this trilogy as well, albeit with a lot of skimming over the romance parts, and still haven't completely convinced myself to given up on the author. Hopefully the Red Scrolls of Magic will be a turning point, but at the moment, it feels like wishful thinking.
"Messy, all that romantic love business."
