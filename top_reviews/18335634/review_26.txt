Come to think of it... Once I've read the book and decided to add MORE, it's gonna be... Can't think of another adverb to put before the word "long" but I get the point. Anyway, I can't keep my fingers off the keyboard! MORE MORE MORE!***-----------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Cassie Clare,PLEASE RELEASE THE BOOK NOW! :(I just quit my job and I'm now officially a bum.For me not to become a TOTAL couch potato and loser, please help me make my time more productive by releasing this book and letting me read it. I'd really appreciate it. Love,JEN, the almost-but-not-exactly-a-couch-potato-YET-but-soon-to-be-one :DP.S.I know that you don't want your fans to be like this, so can you kindly give us what we want? Pretty please with a scoop of ice cream on top??? :D :D :D-----------------------------------------------------------------------GOD!!!  (<-- THIS has become my favorite word for Cassandra Clare's books!)I'm going to go CRAZY!I think I already AM crazy...When is November coming!? (<-- Well, I suppose it will come after October, but you get it!)Oh my! I plucked some of my hair off! Like for real!So ALL my family members will have to celebrate their birthdays first before I find out what happens to my dearest JEM...NNNNOOOOOOO!!!!!What a terrible thought!!!!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------Hhhmmm... Hold on... Why does it have a rating? It's not even out yet.How can you rate a book if you haven't even read it? DUH!It doesn't even have a cover so you can't rate that either.Weird... Freakin weird...I wonder what will happen.I'm glad that, FINALLY, the heroine chose the right guy.BECAUSE the bad guy always gets the girl.BECAUSE the bad guy is always the leading man.BECAUSE the bad guy is always the HOTTEST!Why does it work that way!? (Well, so sorry, but I have a soft spot for unwanted guys!)I have nothing against Will but for once, I just want the good guy to win.But I'm pretty sure that Tessa doesn't love Jem as much as she loves Will.And just thinking about that makes me want to come up to her, scream and say:"WHAT THE HELL!? ARE YOU BLOODY SERIOUS!? ARE YOU FREAKIN BLIND!? JEM IS THE ONE!"My heart breaks into a million pieces whenever I think of Jem's love for Tessa and Will's love for his parabatai Jem.I think Will's love for Jem is greater than his love for Tessa.-----------------------------------------------------------------------UGH!!!I need to read a different book to temporarily forget my yearning for The Infernal Devices.Can't you just release this first before The Mortal Instruments???I love TMI but TID is so much better!OH MY JEM!-----------------------------------------------------------------------OH GOD!I just read the synopsis for this book!I think I lost a part of my heart!Jem can't die!He better NOT die!-----------------------------------------------------------------------I already turned a year older.Gloomy Birthday for me.Not only because of that stupid PRINGLES!!!But also because I still don't have this book in my hands!Wait a minute...Is that the cover???-----------------------------------------------------------------------This review is definitely getting LOOOONNNNGGGEEERRRRR.Hey, where else can I vent out my frustration if the people around me are not into books?No matter how much I tell them, "I AM SLOWLY DYING DAY BY DAY BECAUSE CASSIE CLARE DOESN'T WANT TO RELEASE CLOCKWORK PRINCESS THIS YEAR!!! MY ARTERIES ARE ON THE VERGE OF EXPLODING BECAUSE OF THE ANGUISH THAT I AM TRYING TO CONTROL!", they would just say, "What the heck are you talking about??? Get the fuck away from me you weirdo!"DOUBLE FRUSTRATING!So these rumors that I've been reading about the release of this book are already facts??? 2013!!??? SERIOUSLY???I'm about to get a heart attack any moment now...I definitely need a rune of patience. One anti-depressant rune would help too...-----------------------------------------------------------------------Is that Tessa!?GOD SHE'S SO HOOOOOOT for her time!No wonder Will and Jem are going nuts!She's definitely prettier than Clary! (NO OFFENSE GIRL!)Is it just me or can you also see that this cover is a bit different from the first two books? I mean Tessa here looks REALISTIC. Will and Jem look like animation characters in their covers...-----------------------------------------------------------------------I don’t know what to say...Where do I start?I can’t even compose myself and gather my thoughts together!But as forethought: Honestly, I don’t know whether I should write in the past or present tense! Foreigner here! Help me out! God as an OC, I find it annoying that I don’t know what tense I should use in writing reviews-slash-rants! I know reviews should be in present tense but rants and spoilers? Nevermind! Now writing at my own risk! You read at your own risk! :D I still remember what I felt when I realized that Jem is going to die. It was like an ice pick was SLOWLY being thrust in my heart. The pain was sharp and unfathomable!Among all the book characters I’ve come to like and hate, Jem is the only one I feel most inclined with. He is more than a favorite. It’s actually indescribable. I can’t find the words to express how much I love his character. So for someone who loves this character dearly, IT’S HARD TO ACCEPT THAT HE’S GOING TO PASS AWAY, PROBABLY BE FORGOTTEN, AND ONLY BE PRESENT IN MEMORIES!Did I cry? I think not (probably because I was reading in front of my loved ones!). The grief I felt was beyond tears. Honestly, I lost all my interest in finishing this book and the series itself. When put into actions, these are probably what I felt upon finishing Chapter 13, The Mind Has Mountains:[image error]After a few more pages, I stopped reading and gave up on finishing CP2, especially after finishing Chapter 14, Parabatai!But then the Lenten Season came and with it, a day without work to be done. I started to get bored and thought (REALLY HARD) of finally continuing where I left off. So in the end, I finished CP2… without feeling relieved!Should I be happy with the story? Honestly, I DON’T KNOW! Why? Because no matter what others say, I firmly believe, with all my heart, that JEM LOST!He sacrificed EVERYTHING for Will and Tessa! Actually, he sacrificed MORE for WILL! How can a character be SO UTTERLY NICE!? I can’t understand why!!! I SO want to punch my computer monitor at this very moment!Okay, I think I’m perfectly calm now. And for the record, I did NOT punch my monitor, for I need it to finish this review-slash-rant.Jem’s heart is so pure that he even decided to give his blessing and Tessa’s hand to Will! Oh by the Angel! Tessa says he’s not a martyr but HE IS! How can you let yourself slowly die of unending pain just to see your blood brother be happy!? Well, not that Will is without pain or anything… It’s just that… OH! WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO NICE MY BELOVED JEM!?Can I ever find a guy like My Jem? Anyway, even though he had to suffer more than Will had to (YES! Don’t fight with me because Will bathed in light and Jem lived in total darkness, literally and figuratively!), I am still happy because he found his happiness in the end. He deserves it. But what he doesn’t deserve is to be the SECOND. He clearly ought to have more, and coming in second and getting scraps (YES! I am talking about Tessa and her love) is not what I have in mind when I say MORE.[image error]I badly wanted Jem to win and not Will. But in the deepest part of my heart, I already knew that Will is going to win. It’s how Cassandra Clare writes her stories – the good guy loses; the bad one wins.Anyway... What I am not happy about is the style of writing. What happened to the hopeless romantic characters? What ever happened to the sweet lines delivered by romantic people in the Victorian Era? While reading, all I could picture was American characters in American soil living in the present time. I think Cassandra Clare is too absorbed with finishing all her Shadowhunter series, (which to be honest, is already too many, though I must say I LOVE! So hooked to this Shadowhunter thingy!) that she does not notice that the quality of her works are diminishing. Even CoLS is not good! It’s probably her worst book ever! I was expecting more from CP2. I was actually looking forward to the heartwarming lines between Jem and Tessa and Tessa and Will, but there was none. There was probably a few, but not as good as the lines in the first two books.Now what I LOVE about this book is the relationship of Will and Jem. Honestly, their more-than-brother-bond love for each other brought more tears to my eyes than the Will-Tessa-Jem love triangle. The Parabatai bond is really apparent in CP2. Readers are exposed to the ritual and what it really means to be bound under it. It’s really more than being brothers. It’s a brotherhood that can never be explained through words. When Will felt the Parabatai bond sever, I felt it as well. I felt everything Will and Jem went through without each other. Will is right, it’s like losing a part of your heart. And every time I think about the bond they shared and somehow, but not totally, lost, I feel like someone is tearing my heart. This Parabatai thingy is something that Cassandra Clare should be proud of, I think. It’s really a good concept.Give yourself a tap on your shoulder Cassie! :DOkay… Before finally saying goodbye to this series (I feel like weeping like a 5-year old!), I would really like to know what happened to Jem in the Silent City. I want to know how and who found his cure. WHAT is the cure? The Jem-and-Tessa relationship is not interesting anymore. We all know what would happen. It’s just like what Will and Tessa had, only with Jem – too predictable. I am just concerned about James Carstairs’ life. I hope I would find out in The Dark Artifices. Or is it possible to have even just ONE book about him and his life and journey as a Silent Brother? That I think is more interesting than the life of a normal Shadowhunter. Jem’s character is really mysterious and special, and I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT IT!
