My sixth book by Mr Abercrombie and as always he never cease to amaze me with his writing, especially when he is writing about “War”.So ‘The Heroes’ is story of Black Dow, the Northern King, and Union army finding themselves battling over an old monument called, The Heroes.As it is war, so there are tons of characters and with them lay the beauty of the book. its the story of famous names, fallen and new names. its the story of people who are strong headed, cruel, ambitious, self-centered, vicious and people who knows how to survive a war. And Abercrombie has done a wonderful job of doing justice to every character in this book. There are two things that I liked most about this book. First is how Mr. Abercrombie has described the battle scenes, from one person to another, almost in a sequence. He made these battles alive with his words. Second thing that I liked is I really never got settled for one side. Sometimes I wanted Union to win the war and at other times I was rooting for Northern side. None of the side was good, at the most they’re the evil sides led by equally evil leaders. I didn’t liked any of the Union warriors, not that there were many. Only Gorst caught my attention and he too was annoying as hell when he was not fighting. Other than him no other Union troop is worth mentioning for me. But I liked most of the characters in Black Dow’s army. Craw, Shivers, and even Calder, all were very good. So if you like action, war, treachery, then this one is for you.
