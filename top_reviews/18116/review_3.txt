I read these three books to and with my child a few years after they were published. By the second and third, kiddo was waking up early and reading ahead. So I had to read further ahead because some of the vocabulary and philosophical and theological issues were huge for a child of seven or eight. We had some fantastic discussions as a result, and they nurtured a budding love of fantasy that probably started with The Hobbit (see my review HERE) and Harry Potter, which we read around the same time. Like those, the worldbuilding and associated terminology were part of the immersive charm. We didn't read any of the spin-offs (though kiddo might subsequently have done so), but we did see Nicholas Wright's epic stage adaptation in 2003 (playscript here) at the National Theatre, over two days, starring Anna Maxwell Martin, Patricia Hodge, and Timothy Dalton.

I may, possibly, reread the original books, but I fear they will lack the magic without my young, bright, but credulous child (who married a fellow Tolkien fan a couple of weeks ago!).The reason for posting this so many years later is partly so I don't forget, but also because these memories were reignited by reading Daisy Johnson's Everything Under (see my review, HERE), which also features people living on the waters of Oxford.
