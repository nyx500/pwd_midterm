So, this is a bind up of all three books in this series and it's a reread for me. I first read these when I was very young (maybe 11/12) and I remember absolutely loving them. This still remains true to this day and they are excellent books the second time through too. Also, being 10 years older now than when I first read it helped me to notice a lot more of the subtle references to religion, souls, sex, body image and so on. None of these were things I was even considering when I was young, but now these things become a vital part of the story, making this book one which bridges the gap between fun for kids and interesting for adults.This is the story of Lyra, and later Will. They are both children, one from an alternative world (Lyra) where they have deamons which act as an eternal companion and soul, and one from our world (Will). We meet only Lyra in book #1 but by book #2 and #3 we have a lot of Will's involvement too and it quickly becomes a series about friendship, strength of character, love and adventure.The character and worlds within this feel very genuine and expansive and I definitely connected with some truly horrific moments of the plot and felt deep sorrow, joy and sadness for the different characters at differing moments.On the whole and excellent one to reread and a solid 4.5*s on the reread becuase of all the new things I picked up and loved the second time through :) Highly recommended!
