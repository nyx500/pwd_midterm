*heaves deep breath in*Where do I even begin? Leigh friggin' Bardugo. You really, truly outdid yourself with this one. Never in my life have I been more severely anxious over a novel than this right here— would it live up to the hype's madness? Could it surpass the sheer awesomeness that was Six of Crows? Will anything ever compare? Was I just digging my own grave of unfulfilled hopes and dreams like this?Yes, yes, yes and NO, thank the Saints (or well, Inej will).Crooked Kingdom is one of those rare masterpieces that manages to get 98% of the things right in a sequel. On my watch, at the very least.Let me start off by talking about one of the best aspects of this book: the character development. If tackling six major character arcs wasn't already grueling enough, giving them all intricate backstories and emotional integrity should be downright onerous. But that, my friends, is precisely where Leigh hits the mark.It's no secret that our misfit gang of delinquents is the reason most of us fell in love with this series so hard. Of course, there's also the world-building, the one-liners, the adrenaline rush that comes with every heist, with every twist and turn and tumble; they're all part of the package. But to me, it's our Dregs that made this a real game-changer.We live in a time where standing out in a sea of recycled literature is an author's greatest challenge, with the young adult genre at the very forefront of this ocean. And with Kaz, Inej, Wylan, Jesper, Nina and Matthias, it's like being hit with a motherfucking tsunami. As we get to know them more and more with every layer peeled back, there's no helping the deep-rooted connection one starts to form with each one. Leigh does this evil little thing where just as a chapter begins to get intense, she switches to the next one. The weird part is that this didn't even bother me much since I cared about ALL of their perspectives. (Especially my precious cinnamon roll Wylan, adding his POV was the greatest thing to happen to this book ♡)In terms of plot, hoooo boy did shit go down! Cons upon cons thrown at every corner, it never keeps you off your toes or silently going fuck yeah with every tiny victory— then just as quickly turning that into oh fuck no as things go awry. I can see why some may have a hard time picturing a bunch of ragtag teenagers doing the things they do (not to forget Kaz's impeccable scheming abilities) but honestly, that's exactly what I signed up for. It's meant to be make-believe and it sure as hell does a good job making me believe it.Now I'd like to take a moment and say: AHOY, THE SHIPS HAVE SET SAIL! One of them may still be learning how to steer while another met with a certain iceberg, iceberg cause it was at the hands of a Fjerdan. Gettit? Haha, I'm gonna go cry myself to oblivion now. but all aboard! I came for the feelz and I left with more than I could handle. Okay maybe not all of it, I still want that Kanej kiss one day! *shakes fists of frustration* Props to keeping it realistic though.So after all that raving, you must be wondering: where did that 2% go then, hmmm? Well. You know it. I know it. We all know it. (Unless you haven't read the book yet, in which case, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE YOU WEIRDO GO PICK IT UP.) Spoilers incoming, y'all.Matthias. My sweet, tortured, better-than-waffles Matthias. You had the most significant transformation of them all and after everything you went through, you did not deserve to go out this way. But you know what? No matter how much my heart aches (and will continue to do so), the harsh reality remains that such is life. A split second, one meaningless, avoidable, STUPID little second is all it takes to snatch it away, and that is why it is so hard to come to terms with the fact. However, part of me does feel as if justice was not fully served. Was Matthias treated to feel like the most dispensable option? What becomes of Nina? Yes, there is a lingering sense of sorrow after his passing, but in her attempt to avoid a devastating ending, Leigh makes his death feel a bit like it's been kicked to the curb. Had it been Kaz, Inej or Wylan in his place (three favourites of mine), I know I wouldn't have been too happy with the way she handled it. Even so, that remaining 98% keeps me more than satisfied.Scratch that, make it a 5%. Another minor issue of mine stems from -believe it or not but- Kaz. Throughout the whole thing, there felt an undercurrent of him just being so, I dunno, disconnected from the rest? Let it be known that apathy becomes Kaz Brekker, but where I hoped to see his walls crumble down, it isn't until welllll into the second half that we do. More overcoming personal demons, less pretending not to care, please. But the final result still makes me want to jump around in song and twirl his aloof (and secretly-concerned) ass.
“I would have come for you. And if I couldn't walk, I'd crawl to you, and no matter how broken we were, we'd fight our way out together-knives drawn, pistols blazing. Because that's what we do. We never stop fighting.”
If I could, I'd list all my favourites lines here but then I'd be quoting half the damn book. Her wonderous way with words has made sure that I will always be coming back for more Bardugo. To conclude, Six of Crows has easily been one of my most fulfilling reads quite possibly EVER. All I can do now is hope to live till time machines exist, perhaps then I could go back and experience it all over again.*lets deep breath out*____________________I...I need a moment.
