“Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?” -American songstress Katy Perry on the tragedy of finishing this duologyI do not “have emotions” very often. I am rarely “sad,” which is a personal choice because being sad is gross and unpleasant. I much prefer to exist in an emotionless vortex of my own creation.However.I AM SO VERY SAD THAT THIS DUOLOGY IS OVER.All I want to do is dive back in (hence the “wanting to start again” part of the iconic quote above). And I don��t understand. Why am I so attached? This series, with series even being a strong word, is a mere TWO BOOKS LONG. It is divided among SIX PERSPECTIVES. I’ve spent longer amounts of time with batches of cookies than with these characters, and everyone knows I devour cookies like the ungodly Sesame Street creature/nightmare known as Cookie Monster.And yet that DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT I AM SAD.I miss this gang. I miss their hijinks and heists. I miss their banter. I even miss their extremely formulaic and occasionally one-track personalities. (Yes, we get it. Nina likes food. Matthias and Wylan blush a lot. Very creative.) I miss the will they/won’t they romances even though they were more “yes, of course they will. Obviously.”But another thing that doesn’t change in spite all of the aforementioned Feeling is...that this book is not as good as the first one. Granted, that’s a high bar, considering I five starred Six of Crows and spent an entire review narrowly resisting the urge to just type the word “AAAAAAAAAHHHHH” until it extended for 20,000 characters and we could call it a day. But still. Not as good.This plot was not as exciting by half. Or a third. Or a small small fraction. In fact, the only reason I’m even four starring this book is that I’m still so astonished I could like three characters from one book that it feels sacrilegious to rate it any lower.Everything about this was less exciting and less fresh and less unputdownable. You can’t just give me a heist in the first book and then talk about a bunch of dark-magic-drug-sci-fi-type stuff. I hate the trope of magic that damages you to use/turns you evil, because magic is fun and should be used all the time in every book forever. Also I hate most sci-fi, because it’s boring. It’s science. Don’t explain science to me even if you think it seems fun and fantastical, because it’s not. It’s a waste of my time and yours.Anti-science rant: concluded. For now. But watch yourself, science.There was also a lot more Time With Characters I Don’t Care For, Operating Under The Assumption That I Do Care For Them, Which Is False, Because I Do Not. There is way too much Wylan in this, and way, way, way, way, WAY too much Nina and Matthias. Especially NinaandMatthias as one entity. No thanks. Not interested.Nor am I interested in KUWEI, who manages to be a science-genius-with-magic who is also a hostage who is also in love with a person it would be messy to be in love with, and yet in spite of all of that is SO GODDAMN BORING! What the hell? It seems like you’d have to go out of your way to make the hostage boring, but there we have it. He’s a one-way ticket to snoozetown.Anyone else a huge fan of the fact that this four-star review is majority complaining? Devastatingly on-brand for me. Loving it.And I really don’t want to say any more nice things so. Think I’m good.Bottom line: My only real complaint about this book is that it isn’t Six of Crows, but that alone is such a goddamn personal insult to me and my family and my loved ones and my ancestry and my future descendants that I’m tempted to one star this just for the drama.----------------------pre-reviewthis series is only 2 books long. the perspective is split among 6 people. if you think about it, i've barely even spent any time with these characters at all.SO WHY IS THE FACT THAT IT'S OVER SO GODDAMN SAD.review to come :(----------------------rereading updatesexcuse me, FBI? i'd like to report an attempted murder. well kaz keeps thinking about inej and clearly leigh bardugo is trying to kill me with cutenes -- what? yes i'll hold--the first time I read this book I thought it was slightly disappointing, which is why I'm ROLLIN INTO THIS REREAD WITH MY EXPECTATIONS HIGH AF!!!--this reread brought to you once again by the generosity of lily
