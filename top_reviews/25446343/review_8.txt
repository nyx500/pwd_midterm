My heart is so. Full! —————————Initial review.This is how I woke up feeling this morning. I thought I could not review Strange the Dreamer properly because of how much I loved that book and though I did kinda manage to review it, I’m not even going to try with this one. My mind is exhausted. Laini Taylor had a field day with it and I am wiped. The reading experience I had with these books could be summed up in two words: healing and spiritual.I can’t wait to revisit this world and all it encompassed, but that’s for another time. When I think I can handle it again. Go and bless your souls with these book. That’s all I’m going to say. Over and out. --------------------------Rambles and thoughts. 💭 UK COVER COME THROUGH!!!!Look at this beaut though, jeezus! 😍--------------------------I'm currently in the process of reading Strange the Dreamer and wanting this book already even though I'm not even half-way through book one. US cover is great and all but let's be real, UK cover.. >>>>>>>>>*Possibly. This could go really wrong. Potentially. Highly doubt it, because UK cover > US cover. 🙃
