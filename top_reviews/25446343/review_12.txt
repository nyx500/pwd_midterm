"How Not to Act Like a Supercilious Gulik to Your Barbarian Hosts."
Going to keep this one short. After appreciating Laini Taylor's imagination, prose, and world building thrice with Daughter of Smoke and Bone, and again with Strange the Dreamer, it is redundant to repeat the same things over an over again. Muse of Nightmares picks up from the last twist in plot we encountered at the end of Strange the Dreamer. But that's not all: we are finally getting the backstory of the first book, using an independent plotline to explain how everything came to be prior to godspawn. I'm not a big fan of heavy romance in Fantasy, and it felt a little repetitive to go through Strange's romance life with Sarai, but it was nothing intolerable. Other than that, the plot was quite good, and the author brought the two plotlines together at the last. When compared to the first, I think I liked the first book a little more, but this was not that behind.
