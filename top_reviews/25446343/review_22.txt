Actual Rating: 3.5 StarsI feel so weird rounding this book to a 3 stars, but compared to how much I adored the first one I think I would feel even weirder having it displayed as a 4. It was good, and Iâ€™m glad I read it. But it didnâ€™t have the same magic for me that the first one had, sadly. ðŸ’”
