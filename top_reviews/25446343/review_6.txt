Re-read with Lynn and Alison ... Because we can't only read the first one! AHHHHHHHH! :D “There comes a certain point with a hope or a dream, when you either give it up or give up everything else. And if you choose the dream, if you keep on going, then you can never quit, because it's all you are.”PERFECTION. COMPLETE AND UTTER PERFECTION. This is what I looked like on release day. In fact, I didn’t even wait for the school day to end before bolting to the bookstore in excitement. Who cares about class when you could be picking up your most anticipated release of 2018?!And can I just say how SATISFYING it is when…not only does the aforementioned release meet your expectations…but it completely surpasses them and blows them out of the water?!!! Every time, I think, “there’s no way that Laini could top this”, and every time, I’m proven wrong! The woman is a master wordsmith and I aspire to be her apprentice one day! The writing style was obviously beautiful and magical, as Laini’s always tends to be. I also really enjoyed the witty banter from all of the characters!This was definitely a more plot-driven novel, in comparison with the character-driven Strange the Dreamer. And whereas, the first instalment revolved around Lazlo and we spent the majority of the time in his head, this sequel was definitely Sarai’s book (although I won’t lie…I kind of missed Lazlo, as we didn’t spend quite so much time with him *sad face*). This makes sense though, seeing that Lazlo’s book is Strange the Dreamer and Sarai’s is Muse of Nightmares. Having said that, the plot was bloody brilliant. The foreshadowing was mind-blowing and the world-building was massive with multiple worlds and dimensions. And the references to the Daughter of Smoke & Bone trilogy!!! Everything is connected and Laini Taylor is my world-building goddess. It was just TOO GOOD!“Those seraphim who escaped into the neighbour world Eretz managed to hold the portal closed, and they held it to this day, pouring their strength into shoring up their sky to keep the darkness at bay. A bold young queen in that distant world was even now training a legion of angels and chimaera to battle the darkness and hopefully destroy it. But that’s another story.” I’d also like to point out that the chapter titles in this book are GLORIOUSLY HILARIOUS! For example: “Tea Break from the End of the World” or “From a Long Line of Indignant Nostrils” or “A Man Who Loves You Enough to Come Back to You Even When You’re a Biting Ghost”!!! I shall forever refer to Thyon as “Indignant Nostrils”, by the way. xDRuza snorted. “But I am a stupid barbarian?”“Did I say so?”“You say it with your face.”“That’s just his face,” said Calixte in a pretence of defending him. “He can’t help having indignant nostrils. Can you, Nero? You probably come from a long line of indignant nostrils. Aristocrats are issued them at birth, along with haughty eyes and judgmental cheeks.”“Judgmental cheeks?” repeated Ruza. “Can cheeks be judgmental?��“His manage.” “People are our safe places. I have one: a person who’s a home and a world to me.”BUT THE BEST PART WERE THE SEXY TIMES WITH LAZLO AND SARAI!!! Sooo steamy!!! “The way he looked at her, she felt like some kind of miracle, as though his dreamer’s eyes cast her in their glow of wonder.”The novel picks up right where Strange the Dreamer left off. Laini Taylor drowned me in a gorgeous world with rich mythology and beautiful characters…and then left me in emotional turmoil. Thanks, oh so much! xD I took my time and savoured this faery tale of a story. I want more and hope that she delivers one day, especially considering the open ending that we were given. Laini’s ruined me for all other fantasy authors for the years to come and I’ll spend my days counting down to her next magical release.“Wishes don’t just come true. They’re only the target you paint around what you want. You still have to hit the bull’s-eye yourself.”We learn SO MUCH history about the city that fascinated Lazlo since childhood…Weep, the city that he studied meticulously, and was unknowingly a part of (AND WE FINALLY LEARN ITS TRUE NAME). Lazlo learns to use his fascinating new powers and to embrace who he truly is. He is no longer the shy and meek librarian that he once was. Sarai, Feral, Sparrow, and Ruby also finally learn about the world below the Citadel that they’ve always been kept hidden from. Minya, so broken and so wrathful, is also forced to finally face the Godspawn-hating world that she’s tried to protect them from. She also holds Sarai’s very existence in her hands, giving her even more power over the Godspawn and Lazlo. She has the ultimate bargaining tool. “For an instant, at least, they seemed one and the same, as though all anguish exists in the same deep well, no matter what loss or misfortune leads us to it. We might be at odds, hate each other, and desired each other’s destruction, but in our despair, we are lost in the same darkness, breathing the same air as we choke on our grief.”But despite that…every single “villain” in this duology gets a redemption arc, which RIPPED MY HEART OUT. They all had tortured pasts and were forced to do awful acts in order to empower themselves, which was so heart-breaking to witness. There was so much rage and pain and MY HEART HURTS. So, I guess, I’m now a shell of myself…“You’re the good kind of faranji, I suppose.” “Oh yes,” she said. “Very good. I even taste good, or so I’m told.” He was focused on not falling to his death, and so he missed the mischief in her voice. “Taste,” he scoffed. “I suppose they’re cannibals. Who’s calling them barbarians now?” Calixte laughed with delighted disbelief, and it was only then, too late, that Thyon took her meaning. Oh gods. Taste. He flung back his head to look up at her, nearly losing his balance in the process. She laughed harder at the shock on his face. “Cannibals!” she repeated. “That’s good. I’m going to start calling Tzara that. My sweet cannibal. Can I tell you a secret?” She whispered the rest, wide-eyed and zestful: “I’m a cannibal, too.”The faranji! My beloved faranji! They were amazing! Calixte and Tzara, Thyon and Ruza. Ah, their dynamics warm my heart. The sass…the humour! And to think I hated Thyon in Strange the Dreamer! His character development was honestly amazing and everything I ever wanted! My only complaint is that they had such small and insignificant roles here. I was definitely left wanting more! Eril-Fane, Azareen, and Suheyla were also highlights for me. I’m so happy with how their storylines wrapped up. It was beautiful. <3 And of course, KoraandNova’s storylines made me cry. It’s just not fair what Laini Taylor does to me. My heart cannot handle all of these emotions!!! She left me SOBBING at multiple points in the book!!!“The gods had been dead for fifteen years, after all, but their hate had lingered, and ruled in their stead.”This duology had so much mythology in it that Laini Taylor could’ve definitely stretched this into more than two books, and honestly, I wish that she had. But no matter. This was a fantastic and satisfying conclusion. The ending was also left open enough that it provides hope that someday, we’ll be given more stories in this brilliant world. All I want to see is a crossover of Strange the Dreamer with Daughter of Smoke and Bone! Is that too much to ask? ;) “You should have seen them, Thyon said. "It was surreal." As an afterthought, he added, "Though I can't believe none of them rode the dragon." "I know!" said Ruza. "What was Azareen's thinking, choosing a winged horse when she could have a dragon?" "I don't think she was really focused on which creature was best," said Tzara.  "You shouldn't have to focus on it," said Ruza. "It's instinctive. Dragons are always best.”I also heard that Laini is considering writing a Thyon and Ruza novella (much in the vein of Zuzana and Mik in Night of Cake & Puppets) about hunting for dragon eggs, which I need ASAP! :DI swear, every time I read a Laini Taylor book, I’m like, “This one! This one’s now my favourite!” xD How do her books just keep getting better and better?!!! Needless to say, this book has replaced Days of Blood & Starlight as my favourite book of all time! <3 I can’t wait to re-read this again next year!!!
