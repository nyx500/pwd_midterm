 “The clan was not just people and jade and money. It was an idea, a legacy that connected the pats with the present and the future. The family’s strength was a promise.” 
🌟 Disclaimer: I received a finished proof of Jade War in exchange for an honest review and my participation in a blog tour.🌟 Often times we as readers hear about the middle book syndrome and we have all experienced the second book being meh in a series! I do understand that specially after writing a successful and the expectations are high. 🌟 But let me tell you about the middle book miracle where the second book is bigger, better, and more exciting than book 1 in all aspects of the book.🌟 If you have read my review of book 1, you would know that I liked it but had some criticism and things that I said could be improved. And few things can make me happy as seeing authors improve as if they listened to my advice! (Don’t get this wrong, I am not saying that the author listened to me, she has great readers who helped her but it felt like so).🌟 I have been enjoying books more lately since changing to adult fantasy books! Lee’s writing is great and very easy to get into. I like how she kind of reminded us of what happened in book1without forcing it on us. It was so smooth!!The names of the chapters are one of my favorite things about this book. (Green as fuck for example!!)🌟 The characters are as fleshed out as in book 1. There are many surprises, many new characters and many babies! The glossary at first helped keeping all these characters in mind although they were well introduced that I didn’t have to jump back to it many times.🌟 I read the first book with Fares and we agreed that the world building could have been better. It was better here. I mentioned that money was not prevalent in book 1 as it should have been. Surprise surprise, there was some focus on it here. The magic system did not improve significantly but I just felt more comfortable with it here. I think that there is no shame in having a simple yet entertaining system.We also have 3 maps at the start of the book as we are now talking about politics on a continent level. There was so much political and strategical intrigue and I liked how real it felt.🌟 The plot in the book is interesting too. I felt my heart racing in anticipation a few times while reading this and that is great. There is a cool duel that left me on my tiptoe and many surprised along the way that I think you should experience for yourselves.🌟 Summary: Jade War is the mega evolution form of Jade City where the author tended to all the small details in book 1. It felt better from all aspects and I can’t wait for book 3 now!!!
