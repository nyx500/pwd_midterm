Check out my recent interview with Fonda Lee at Grimdark Magazine.Jade War is an example of an absolutely perfect middle volume of a trilogy.Jade War builds upon the outstanding foundation of Jade City, especially its multi-layered web of inter-personal conflicts, and then takes the conflicts to a global scale.Fonda Lee's writing is outstanding, as usual. I especially admire her character work in Jade War, which has a number of heartbreaking scenes that will stay with me for a very long time.For a more complete analysis, I will point you to the excellent review by my friend, James Tivendale, at Grimdark Magazine.
