I don't usually write reviews but I have to. You guys. YOU GUYS.THIS BOOK IS INCREDIBLE.Fonda Lee shouldn't have been able to write a better book than Jade City because that isn't technically possible, but then somehow, incredibly: she DID??? This book is tense and lush and beautiful and violent and it completely wrecked me. I couldn't stop reading it. It features the best fight scene in the series so far, a fight scene that I had to read standing up because I was so adrenalized by it. The character development is seamless, the intrigue is INCREDIBLY tense, the female characters are powerful and flawed. The prose, as always, is stunning. This book is incredible. (I had to say it a second time.) Read it.
