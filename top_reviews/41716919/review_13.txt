4.5 StarsThis has easily become one of my new favourite fantasy series. It just feels so different than the classic fantasy narratives I am use to reading. I thoroughly enjoyed the first book, but I loved the sequel even more. I have become more attached to the characters in this one. I love that they are all complex and morally grey, often making controversial decisions. There are so many iconic, jaw dropping moments in this book. I am definitely looking forward to reading the finale book, Jade Legacy.
