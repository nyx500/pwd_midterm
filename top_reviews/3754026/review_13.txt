I finally got around to reading Brent Weeks. This is my first series of his and I'm glad I jumped on board. The Night Angel trilogy is complex and very intricate and in my opinion the intricacy and complexity of the series as a whole is the best part about it. The plot continuously twists and morphs giving the reader a sense of constant emotion and concern for the characters.However, the characters are not as good as I would like. Some of the character decisions were hard for me to understand or make any sense of and I felt some definite motivation issues for some of the main characters. But I was able to overlook most of these things because the plot is just so darn good.In this last installment, there were some really cool twists and revelations, as well as a more epic scope which made the whole thing very enjoyable and I noticed that there were fewer filler chapters and less rambling. There were however several details and events that I thought were poorly done and I felt had no place. Like Durzo flying? Really...? And Logan shooting a dragon out his arm because he got magical snake goop on it? Yeah some things were a bit farfetched for me to accept, even in a fantasy. Maybe if there had been more foreshadowing or additional explanation. Maybe. But again, the weaving story and awesome moments are the trilogy's saving grace. I can't rate it lower than 4 stars because ultimately I liked it and it was a satisfying read.
