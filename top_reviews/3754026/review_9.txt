Brent Weeks sure knows how to conclude a series. All the lose ends was tied, I can't think of anything that was forgotten for that I applaud the author. I still think the writing could have been better, the POV was still terrible. The world building and writing is as explicit as ever.
“Kylar, in the crucible of tragedy, explanations fail. When you stand before a tragedy and tell yourself that there is no sense to it, doesn’t your heart break? I think that must be as hard for you as it is for me when I scream at God and demand to know why—and he says nothing. We will both survive this, Kylar. The difference is, on the other side I will have hope.”
I have one problem with this book, thus the 4 stars, Elene's part in the end was uncalled for, I get that she wanted to be important but that was too much.Characters Dorian's part in the book was by far my favourite, it was awesome. His magic, politics, relationship with those around him and basically everything about Dorian was awesome.Jenine wasn't too bad also, I love that she didn't play the damsel in distress role cause that would have sucked.
For a man who denies what is essential to his being is a man who drills holes in the cup of his own happiness.
Kylar was okay in this, he wasn't bad neither was he awesome. Logan was awesome as usual but his selflessness and sense of justice sucks sometimes.Finally Viridiana was awesome in some places and other times she was annoying.PlotThis started just where the previous book ended, Kylar is on a quest to put Logan on a throne then discovered his price for immortality. Dorian went back and things didn't turn out the way he expected. Vi is making the best out of the second chance she got.
