Thus ends another trilogy. Overall, I was disappointed with Beyond the Shadows. In Way of the Shadows Weeks spun a marvelous tale for us. He hooked me deep. In Shadow's Edge Weeks continued a great story. I felt that Beyond the Shadows was a poor ending to a great beginning. What I felt was the biggest upset in this book was that Weeks stopped showing us the story. Instead, he told us what happened. As any good author knows, show, don't tell. We would flip between characters, sometimes months going by between when we last saw them, and he'd give us a quick rundown of what they've accomplished. A lot of times what they've done would be really hard to do, and he gives us no explanation on how they were done. I felt that Weeks decided to surprise us with many plot twists, but in doing so he neglected to tell us just how they happened. We were joined a lot of the stories after they had had their plot twists. I also had an ending with The Wolf at the end. He just told Kylar what was going to happen to all of his friends in the future. Again, show, don't tell. Weeks could have had a small chapter for each of them where they made up their minds on what to do. I would have loved to see Momma K and Durzo reunited. Instead we're just told it's going to happen.Also, I felt that Weeks left several of the minor plots going as the book ends. It's the end of the trilogy, but with what Weeks left us with, it'd be very easy to see Kylar again. Overall, I thought this book was acceptable. It wasn't nearly as good as Way of the Shadows, or Shadow's Edge. The plot was quite good, but everything was way to rushed.
