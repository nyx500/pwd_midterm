What a great trilogy. I the ending of Beyond the Shadows is pretty good, I really liked it. I do recommend this trilogy to those who really like magic, god-kings, high kings, immortals with great power, great battles with magic, kings, women and soldiers. Many great characters with interesting backgrounds. It's a worthy trilogy to start and finish. I hope you all give this trilogy a shot and read it. It might not be good for some but if you like my books I've read in the past(check profile of my books I've read or compare books) you'll like it very much as I did.
