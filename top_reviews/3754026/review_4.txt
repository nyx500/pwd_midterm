Weeks, we have a problem.I didn't like these books anywhere near as much as I hoped I would. In fact, I was disappointed more often than not.The writing was not to my taste at all. I hated most of the people in the story by the end of the first book. I spent much of my reading time being annoyed by everything.And yet... you had your moments. You had your great characters (is one and a half enough to use the plural form?). And most importantly of all, you had a few fantastic ideas about the world and some of its details, concepts and inhabitants.It wasn't enough. And I'm really disappointed enough to quit.So why on Earth did you have to throw in a few hints at the end that were too good for me to ignore? That made me give this three stars and not two? That made the otherwise so horrible ending worth living through?How often does one's favourite character change at the very of a trilogy?I don't like it one bit, but I desperately want more. I suppose you have your qualities as an author after all.So please give me the sequel series. I'll be ready with another set of three-star ratings, most likely. But at least I know where we stand now.Revanchist's regards
