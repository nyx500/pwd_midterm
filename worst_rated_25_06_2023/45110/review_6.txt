Over the years Robin Hobb has become an absolute powerhouse in the world of fantasy. After devouring all her Elderling books, it was time for the odd trilogy in the bunch: the soldier son. A lot is different in this trilogy, and yet a lot remains the same: there are mysterious plotlines brewing (excellent for speculation!), but at the end of the day, it’s all about the characters. I’m more than ok with that – I’m a very character-driven reader. Yet what this book didn’t have versus all the other trilogies is an instant connection with the main characters. Perhaps that will still follow, but I didn't get there yet.Like Farseer, the Soldier Son is written in one fixed first person narrator. That narrator is a New Noble son called Nevare, but I’ve come to know him as Little Stick In The Mud. He’s one of those fairly inactive protagonists: things happen to him, but he doesn’t do much. And that makes me impatient. Nonetheless, the book sets up some interesting storylines. The boarding school feel (buddy reader David Sven compared it to Hogwarts which was an excellent call) is really well done, comraderies are formed, not so much by choice as by coincidence, but it works and it will be important in the following books I’m sure. There is a lot of ‘unfairness’ in the story, which worked for me, but me rooting for all the little Davids in the story would have worked better if I would actually have loved the little Davids. (At least I already loathed the cross-generational Goliath Stiets, so no issues on that account.)In short, this book isn’t a homerun for me, but it’s promising and I’m looking forward to see what she does with it. And even more so, I’m curious to find out whether I will ever come to like our little Stick-In-The-Mud.
