I have such a bizarre relationship with this trilogy. On one hand I think it is so slow it's agonizing, and on the other I feel it is one of the most underrated pieces of fantasy of all time. I love this trilogy. Many, many people do not. This book does so many things I just haven't seen in the genre. It's so fascinating in a million different ways. It is a very dark and depressing story. I can only think of a few series where the main character's life sucks even remotely close to how bad Nevare's does. I was actually in a pretty bad place in my life when I read Shaman's Crossing. You'd think a tale this morose would make things worse, but funnily enough it kinda helped. I thought 'At least I'm not THIS guy!'. Things can always be worse, so you have to look on the bright side. This trilogy goes so many places. Some of them deep and thought-provoking, others perhaps just tedious. But I'll be damned if I give it anything lower than a five. I adore Robin Hobb and I will fight for Soldier's Son even if no one else will. P.S. Also, Epiny is the best character, fight me.
