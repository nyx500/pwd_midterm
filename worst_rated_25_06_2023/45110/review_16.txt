3.5I’m feeling too lazy to write a full length review, so I’ll just pen a quick summary.The story, world building, and writing here were certainly up to Robin Hobb’s usual high standard, although the story was slow to get started, as her stories often are.But…this wasn’t quite as enchanting as the whole Realm of the Elderlings series was.Why?First, none of the characters are as compelling as the inimitable FitzChivalry Farseer with his wolf NightEyes and his companion of many guises, the Fool. Or the Vestrits, in the Liveship and Dragon Wilds books. Even the many secondary characters in the Elderling books, such as Chade Fallstar, Burrich, Captain Kennit, Regal, Queen Kettricken, Nettle, Prince Dutiful, and Lady Patience are more interesting than the secondary characters in this book.Second, the Elderlings books have more raw adventure of the type we love in epic fantasy: dragons, piracy, Court intrigues, dangerous quests, travel via magical stone plinths, etc.This book is mostly set in a military academy that abuses many of its students. There are rancorous divisions based on class: “old” nobles vs. “new” nobles. Our main character and hero, Nevare Burvelle, a cadet, is a guy with strong principles and fascinating shamanic abilities. Still, he’s military and sometimes comes across as a bit of a stuffed shirt. His adherence to principle is so rigid that it often blinds him to foreseeing real world consequences of his actions. And his shamanic adventures are mostly of the kind that happen in the inner world rather than the outer world, as in the Elderlings books.However, I adore  Robin Hobb and this series has me hooked. Even her lesser output outshines the best work of many other fantasy writers. So in spite of these reservations, I will certainly read the rest of the series.
