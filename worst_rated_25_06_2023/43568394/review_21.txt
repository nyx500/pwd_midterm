i'm a bit baffled by how average this turned out to be. it read as really underwritten and i wished we had more explanation of the world for readers unfamiliar with arthurian folklore, as well as general backstory on who this girl is and why she's qualified to be arthur's protector. it wasn't necessarily bad, but nothing unique to boost it past 3 stars.
