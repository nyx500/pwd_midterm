Didn't manage to finish it during my "One Week, One Shelf" reading Classics but I'll need to soon.The writing is beautiful, the audiobook is good but damn the part where the monster tells you his life is boooooring!Update: The Creature/Monster's section got a bit better but overall the book wasn't to my taste.
