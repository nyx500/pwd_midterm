Full disclosure, listened to this on audiobook, as I do more and more these days. Looking back on the book, I suppose that I'm not really the target demographic. It could be that this is YA, and probably targeted toward young women instead of men. (And by "Targeted" I'm mostly talking about the marketing, rather than Black's writing.) That said, I really enjoyed it. And it only occurred to me right now as I was sitting down to write about it that this book might not be *for* me, technically. I found it a really take on what has the potential to be a very tired trope - a world where vampires have emerged from the shadows. But I didn't find this cliche at all. Quite the opposite in fact. I found the world very interesting and realistic, and the perspective of the story very personal and emotionally charged. I could see this being made into a great movie as well. I'd be surprised if nobody has optioned it yet. So yeah. Absolutely worth your time.
