*4.5 stars*Ah, this book was so great! I really really thoroughly enjoyed it! It's like a zombie apocalypse but with vampires and I looooved it!! The main character Tana was so badass, but I really wish there was like an epilogue or something! Still, really loved this book and it was great to read about vampires again, it's been too long!
