“And I have feelings for you, too. Big, weird, crazy feelings.”I have mixed feelings about this book, but overall I liked it.Tana was an okay character, and it was valiant the way she didn’t leave a vampire behind to his fate! Even if the decision was likely to kill her!The storyline in this was alright, although it reminded me quite a bit of ‘The Immortal Rules’, which is probably in part because I found the pace in both of them quite slow. But otherwise – dystopian setting, slightly different take on vampires, female lead who gets turned into a vampire (to some extent), vampires live in a city and use the human population for food? I totally got the same feeling from both of these. Although I think if I was picking sides I’d say that this was slightly better.There was a little bit of romance, and I didn’t dislike it, even if it was a little unexpected!The ending to this was okay, and it wasn’t too cliff-hanger-y. I’m going to be generous and give this 3.5 stars.
