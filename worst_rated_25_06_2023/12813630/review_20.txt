“Death’s favourites don’t die” Didn’t think reality tv and vampires would ever work together but Black really did that!! I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!This was the most unique take on vampires i’ve read in a longgggg time and i’ve read a lot of them! The world building was so well done, the characters were really interesting, I love Tana so much she was such a good main character. Somehow the insta-love worked well too, props to the author there wow, I found myself really hoping for Gavriel and Tana. Also just as you think everything’s going to work out, plot twist(!) more drama, I really got into this book, I couldn’t stop reading! I really missed the vampire genre and just needed something new to keep it alive for me, so I turned to Holly Black after how much i loved the cruel prince! I’m really loving how inclusive her books are and I feel this is going to set in a long time readership for me. I just wish this wasn’t a standalone...I. NEED. MORE!
