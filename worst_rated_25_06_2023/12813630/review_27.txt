Holly Black,I don't know why I haven't read more of your stuff! I've read only The Darkest Part of the Forest before this one, a year or two ago, and really liked it, so I'm not sure why it's taken me this long to pick up another of your books. My mistake! I loved the flawed characters in this one, the depth of the worldbuilding without info-dumping, the creativity. Also, thanks for making sure you put representation into your book. Some people might call it "the liberal agenda," but I'll gladly wear that intended insult as a badge of honor - fighting for diversity, inclusion, love over hate, acceptance, representation... none of those things are negatives in my book. Alas, this is only a standalone. Such a shame, as I'd love to see more of this world. :) Maybe a sequel in the future? :)Yours,Steven
