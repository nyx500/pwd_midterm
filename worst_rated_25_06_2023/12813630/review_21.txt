It's rare that I come across a vampire book that I so thoroughly enjoy. The Coldest Girl in Coldtown was absolutely phenomenal and I adored it! It was such an interesting take on vampires, quite unlike any other book I've read with them. The world building was fantastic and I just loved the whole idea of the book. And as usual, Black brings to life characters that you can't help but fall completely in love with. The main character Tana is gutsy and doesn't let anything get in her way and I just adore her. And then we have Gavriel. What is there to say about him other than he is officially my favourite and I love him to pieces. My only complaint about this book is that it's over and I desperately wish there was a sequel!
