Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (Author), Frankie Corzo (Narrator)When this book first caught my eye, I read reviews of the ARCs and decided it might be too creepy and full of disgusting body fluids and oddities for me. But that beautiful cover and the weirdness of what might be in the story keep on calling to me, leading me to give the audiobook a listen. I stuck with it despite the grossness of this strange story but I will avoid stories like this one, in the future.In 1950s Mexico, young, rich, party girl, Noemí Taboada makes the journey to remote High Place, a very old mansion, infested with the rot of the dead and dying plant matter and people of the past. Neomi's sick cousin has sent a confusing note begging to be rescued from High Place and an unknown oppressor. Noemi's father urges Neomi to travel to High Place and check on her cousin, with the admonishment that if she doesn't do so he will cut off funding for her masters degree. Once at the foreboding mansion, among the creepy people, fungus and mold infesting every inch of the walls and grounds, Noemi knows that things are very wrong. She has dreams, hallucinations, and hears voices talking to her. The only member of the family her cousin married into that she might be able to trust is a weak young man, cowed by his strong elders. Once we learn what is going on, the story is very repulsive. Up until so much body horror and sacrifice was revealed, I was enjoying the eeriness of the entire situation. This story is for lovers of horror and things most gross but not for me. I have only myself to blame for reading a book that obviously was not a good choice for me. Published June 30th 2020
