Sadly, I did not love Descendant of the Crane as much as I thought I would. The entire first 57% of this book before the first plot twist happens was slow and utterly boring, and it was a chore to get through. Perhaps the slow-moving plot would have been more interesting for me to read if I’d been given anything else to care about. The characters were interesting, and I did really like the sibling dynamics. But overall, I thought they lacked dimension and I felt little investment in them. Some were sidelined with little page time and then written with the assumption that the reader already knew them intimately, one significant example being the love interest. (I did not like the romance at all and thought it completely lacked chemistry and development.) It also felt as if these characters were held at an arm’s length because of the prose itself—which others have seemed to enjoy, but didn’t flow well and felt unnatural to me. All of these issues left me indifferent to the story for more than half of the book.The plot twists are indeed as good as everyone says, though some of them just didn’t hit as hard as I wanted them to, because at that point I had really stopped caring what was going on. I did really love the ending of the book, though. I’m not sure I would definitively say it’s worth reading the whole book for, but the ending leaned into the exact type of messed up, lovely character dynamic I adore and it was so fun to read. Also, I think the book does explore interesting themes, like grief, ethics, and especially the idea of broken family. Unfortunately, though, the few interesting parts of the book were not enough to make up for my lack of investment, and I will only remember this as a mostly boring book that had didn’t live up to its full potential.:: representation :: Chinese-coded cast:: content warnings :: murder, death, violence, slavery, drowning, depictions of blood, depictions of grief
