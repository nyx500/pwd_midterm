3.5 stars  Thanks to Netgalley and Albert Whitman & Company for a digital galley in exchange for an honest review  This little gem may have escaped my notice if I hadn't seen a list of highly anticipated YA novels for 2019. Reeling from the death of a beloved father, the teen regent Hessina is hell bent on finding the person or persons who may be responsible. Plenty of twists and lots of back stabbing betrayals ensue and it isn't long before Hessina wonders- who can I trust? There is potential left here for a sequel and despite a little bit of a slow start in the beginning, I soon was swept away by this tale.
