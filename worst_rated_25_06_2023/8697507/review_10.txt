Jane Austen with Magic: specifically, Sense and Sensibility, for the most part. (Not, interestingly, Heyer-esque; Kowal goes for the older and less comic model.) I found it a very pleasant way to spend an evening, to be sure. Interesting magic system. I much enjoyed the final choice of hero, and the process of that choosing. There were several possibilities in play at first, and the methods of winnowing down the pack by both protagonist and author were instructive.I suspect this crosses over from the F&SF audience to the Romance audience, and I suspect the two pools of readers read it through rather different frames. The Goodreads reviews would likely demonstrate same, but I'm out of time to read them this morning.Ta, L.
