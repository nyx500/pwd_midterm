I love Jane Austen and I love fantasy, so you would think this book, which mixes the two, would be right up my alley, especially since it was written by a Hugo Award-winning author. Can't miss! and yet, somehow, it does. Superficially it's a very Austenesque tale, but it lacks most of the wit, charm and complexity of Austen. Jane is the plain older sister with all the talent in the family: art, music and magic. But at age 28, she feels like she's fated to become a spinster, and she spends most of the book struggling with her insecurities. Frankly, it got pretty tiresome. Melody is her lovely 18 year old sister who doesn't have any particular talents. They love each other, but each is deeply jealous of what the other sister has that she lacks. And they've both developed a tendre for the same eligible gentleman, Mr. Dunkirk, who lives on a neighboring estate.It's interesting that the use of magic, called "glamour," in this world seems to be limited to creating visual illusions. In most ways it's simply another ladylike talent, like drawing, singing or playing piano, that well-bred young women are expected to develop. However, there's a Mr. Vincent who moves into the neighborhood, who is truly an accomplished artist with his glamour illusions. Jane wants to learn from his talent and magical works of art, but the two of them get off on the wrong foot and develop a relationship that's prickly, at best.This struck me as simply a young adult novel ... or maybe a simple young adult novel. I thought it was okay, but on the shallow side. I had no problem finishing it, but I was hoping for so much more. Maybe I'll go re-read Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell.
