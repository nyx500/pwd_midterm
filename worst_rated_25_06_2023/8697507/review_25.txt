If you told me that this was an actual Regency-era fiction, I would probably believe you. Kowal's research is impeccable, and the book feels authentic to the time it recreates. Except, you know, with the addition of subtle magical glamour, which seems like a perfectly reasonable thing for a young lady of good breeding to have done with her time, so I don't see why I should doubt that aspect. Kowal sets up the slight divergence from reality in expert fashion, slipping it into the first paragraphs of the book as if it were perfectly natural, and really had been there all along. I wouldn't be surprised to go back to Jane Austen to find the Bennet sisters working folds of glamour as they sat around arguing about potential suitors.
