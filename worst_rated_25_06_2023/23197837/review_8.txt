I realized I hate repeating myself so here's a whole post on this topicbut anyway: no one is telling you to boycott this, so don't go there. the real point is that I was going to read this while in a horrible mental health stage, it would have been REALLY painful for me, and I am just slightly hurt barely any reviews have mentioned the thing that happens in this book. feel free to look at this review, or just click the spoiler tag:there are a grand total of three sapphic characters in this book. one is a villain. the other two fucking die.
