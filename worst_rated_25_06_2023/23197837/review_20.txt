This is the kind of book where you finish it having mainly enjoyed it but still feeling a little bit letdown. The premise and blurb actually got me really excited for this but it was a little bit disappointing ngl 😒 I did still enjoy it tho!! ☺🤗“Be the best without trying to be better than the others.”The Belles takes place in a fantasy world where humans have been cursed to look ugly, with misshapen bodies and grey skin. However, there are a few non-ugly people- the Belles, blessed by the Goddess of Beauty, and with abilities to transform people’s bodies to make them beautiful too. The Belles are revered above everyone else and our MC, Camellia, is one of them. The book starts off with Camellia and her sister Belles competing to become ‘the favourite’, the special Belle chosen to tend to the royal family, and the plot continues after that.“Lies are as dangerous as a sword. They can cut to the bone.”Starting with the characters. This is one area where I feel a bit meh about bc although I didn’t hate them, I found them all a little bit bland. Camellia, the protagonist, was kinda boring imo and I feel like she didn’t go through a whole lot of growth, instead staying the same throughout the book. The side characters were also not super well fleshed out and I wasn’t really attached to any of them (although I did like Rémy). But on the other hand, they were decently likeable and easy enough to root for. The main ‘villain’ of the story was also super easy to hate. So, the characters were okay 😑Next, the writing. I really loved the writing style!! 🤩🤩 It was super descriptive and elaborate and described the beautiful dresses and luxurious lifestyle the Belles enjoyed in loads of detail 😍 I also loved the descriptions of what the Belles did during their beauty sessions with customers. Dhonielle Clayton’s writing style actually really reminded me of Stephanie Garber’s writing! So if you’re a fan of her writing, I’m sure you’d like the writing in this book too 🥰🥰However, there was one negative about the writing: bc it was so flowery, it could be hard to read for long periods of time and that meant I took a while to read the book. But it’s not that big of a deal.The plot. Hmmmm 😑😑 Tbh the plot wasn’t executed super well- I feel like large chunks were just filler 😬😬 Although interesting things were happening, these different events would be so far apart that you would have to struggle through enormous portions of filler to get to them- and this meant my interest waned at times. It did get a bit better after the halfway mark but imo it only got SUPER interesting in the last 100 pages. However, I LOVED those last 100 pages- so much juicy drama!! The ending was also really good imo 🤩🤩Another thing I really liked was the worldbuilding. It had a super interesting premise that I hadn’t seen done before and discovering more about it throughout the book definitely kept me interested! Although it could be a little too vague at times, it didn’t confuse me too much so that didn’t bother me a huge amount. I also thought using this fantasy world was a really clever way to show humanity’s obsession with beauty. The book had a strong message at its core, which definitely showed 🤗🤗“Love is when hearts beat together.”Overall, there were definitely some ups and downs, but I did enjoy it in the end. Although some things definitely irked me, I would recommend it if you’re looking for:✔️ Super elaborate & magical Stephanie Garber-esque writing✔️ Interesting and original premise✔️ More slower-paced plot✔️ Twists and turns at the end✔️ Intriguing ending✔️ Small romantic subplot But if you decide to give it a go, be warned about the slow and sometimes uneven pacing and lack of characterization. That will definitely bother some readers.Although I did enjoy it, I probably won’t be picking up the sequel. The ending was good, but the thought of reading another slower paced book like this just doesn’t sound appealing. Still, a pretty good read! ☺🙌~ 3.5 stars~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~It was pretty good, but not quite as enjoyable as I was expecting tbh 😒😒 I did love the climax/ending tho!! 🤩🤩RTC!
