3.5* rounded upWhat do I do when I want to read something easy and I have numerous mystery-fantasy series that I already started to choose from? I begin a new one, obviously. Rosemary and Rue is the 1st volume from October Daye series, one of the many available Urban Fantasies with a kick-ass heroine as main character. This series figures on many best of lists when it comes to UF so I bought it some time ago but did not get the chance to read it. Despite the stupidity of the main character, I enjoyed this novel more than others 1st instalments. I wonder why. Maybe it was because the main character was flawed, she was no virgin snowflake or an all mighty hero. October Daye is a changeling, half fae, half human working as a private investigator. When one job goes terribly wrong, she is turned into a pond fish and is thought dead by the fae and her human family (husband and daughter). She manages to escape the pond after 15 years and she finds the world very different. Damaged, she tries to run away from everything but when a fae royalty dies, she is forced to investigate. As I said, Toby is a complex character with a history of abuse and that maybe explains some of the less than ideal decisions she takes in this book. She is supposed to be an excellent investigator but she does not show for it in this one (or the next). She barely manages to stay alive with the help of others, mostly. Still, the writing is funny and the plot is very gripping. I believe the world building was good and the series shows promise. One needs candy from time to time.
