So, Steven recommended this to me, and since I've enjoyed his recommendations in the past...I snagged this one from my library the same day.Was it any good?Hmm. Kinda.I'm going to settle on 3 stars, because it wasn't bad, but I wasn't immediately sucked into the world, the plot, or any of the characters. I can see why a lot of my friends weren't all that impressed with it.BUT.I also remember that I 'liked' the 1st Mercy Thompson, and only felt a vague tingle when I read the 1st Kate Daniels. And now I'd step on my children to get a copy of either of those series' new books.That's only KINDA true. I swear!So.I put the second book on hold a few minutes ago.Because I'm trusting you, Steven! And you, Jessica, with your fantastic review that had me nodding along, and getting excited to do a re-read of a book I wasn't even sure I liked all that much!You two better not let me down...  Kidding! Kidding! I love you both!As far as the story goes, I'm a bit torn.Part of me is really impressed, because not only is the world unique, but so is October. She's not some virginal heroine searching for her knight in shining armor, she's a very broken woman who's lost everything she possibly can, and isn't ready to face the world again. And while she's still got a young vibe (because of her fae nature) she's not some 20something, either. She's got life experience, she's got maturity, and I gotta say...I loved that! On the flip side, some of the rules (especially about changlings & how they were dealt with) was a little tough for me to follow. In fact, I'm still kind of scratching my head about some of that. Part of that is probably my fault because my reading time is more limited now, so maybe I rushed through an important paragraph or two, and didn't even realize it? Entirely possible. By the end, the good outweighed the bad enough that I'm in for the next one. I'm hoping this series grows on me as much as my trusty pals say it will. <--I WANT TO BELIEVE!
