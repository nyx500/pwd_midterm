2014 rating: 5 stars2019 rating: 3 starsHI, HELLO WELCOME are you interested in this book? have you just read it and looking for reviews to analyze the shit show you just read? IM HERE TO CONVINCE YOU ALL HOPE IS NOT LOST is this book poorly written in both vocabulary, sentence structure, and plot? yes. but am I still going to convince you to carry on with the series? ABSOLUTELY listen, I know this first book is a mess. but the world in which the author crafts in this series is one of the best examples of faerie lore I have read. it is a series about immortal, power hungry faerie court politics that is told through incredibly flawed characters that go through development both within themselves AND as lovers. if you want ANGST, if you want DRAMA, if you want 2000s fae that wear leather & listen to punk rock, READ THIS SERIES
