2ish stars.An okay book that I recognize has many merits but that I must concede isn't for me. This book is very well written. Ken Liu uses a very efficient, utilitarian style that somehow also manages to be quite poetic at times and it works well with this mythology-inspired content. I think my biggest issues are personal ones: this isn't what I expected and it's just not my thing. I was expecting/hoping for fantasy and this really isn't that. As mentioned, there's some East Asia-inspired mythology which is cool in concept but I didn't get enough of it to be satisfied. To me, it reads more like a historical fiction/military novel. It took me about 40% of the book to become interested and I was only mildly so after that. I listened on Audible so this might read better in print format. There's a lot of information and there are a lot of characters and it was hard for me to keep track of them without being able to reference previous parts of the book. If the synopsis sounds cool to you and the writing style sounds like something you're into, I totally recommend this book. If you're looking for Chinese-infused steampunk/magic, look elsewhere.
