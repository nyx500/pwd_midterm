Why two stars?:*Women* - Where were they? For 400 pages we had one "main" female character, who ended up being treated way too much like a secondary character. The rest of the women were minor characters. And the main female character spent most of her story arc picking herbs, getting pregnant, having babies, encouraging her husband to take a second wife, and then becoming stereotypically jealous of the new woman in her man's life.We were given one token female warrior character in the latter half of the book who fought in battles alongside the men, but she was hardly an interesting and complex character and she arrived too little too late for me. In all honesty, the ratio of male to female characters in this book is kind of laughable.*Plot* - ambitious, but ultimately lost in a mass of world building and histories and mythology. World building should enhance and complement plot and characters, but this seemed to bury them under its massive weight. If as much care and planning and dimension were put into the characters as was put into this world, then we might have had something really interesting.*Characters* - Wooden, predictable, stereotypical, cliched. There really wasn't a single character I felt a connection to.*Dialogue* - Problematic. At times the dialogue felt appropriate, other times it felt way too modern. I don't mind one style over the other, just have continuity.*Will I Read On?* - No. I love the influence of ancient Chinese dynasties in this novel, and I might could overlook most of the points that I made, but the representation of women and how little they featured in this book doesn't inspire me to continue the series. And though the end of book one has set up a storyline where a few of the female characters may feature more prominently, it looks like the storyline will focus on jealousy and envy between the two wives of the main character - and I feel I can easily find more complex and better representations of women elsewhere.
