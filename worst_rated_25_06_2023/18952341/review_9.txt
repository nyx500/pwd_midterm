As, I suppose, many other readers of The Grace of Kings, I discovered Ken Liu due to his extraordinary translation of Cixin Liu's excellent The Three Body Problem and Death's End as well as his collection of marvelous short stories, The Paper Menagerie. Unlike all of those works, in this first volume of The Dandelion Dynasty series, we are treated to a fantasy universe with middle age technology, interfering gods, and a wonderful mashup stories and legends inspired by classical Chinese and Polynesian mythology. Essentially, it is the story of Mata and Kuni and how their evolving relationship (no spoilers!) affects the island world of Dara. While it takes the Western reader a while to appreciate the multitude of characters, the story really picks up pace and entertains throughout. It does a great job of breaking boundaries from traditional mythology by featuring strong female characters and introducing surprise upon surprise in the plot. There is also a lot of both science and nature, critical for the dumbed-down times we are living in. As Jia, Kuni's wife, says, "When you learn enough about the world, even a blade of grass can be a weapon." (P. 114). I found myself diving deeper and deeper into this fantasy world and really appreciating the depth and variety of characters presented as well as the author's incredible imagination in creating the imperial airships, the armored whales, and a million other brilliant ideas and inventions. I can't wait to read the next volume The Wall of Storms to see what happens next!Fino's Cixin Liu and other Chinese SciFi and Fantasy ReviewsThe Three Body ProblemThe Dark ForestDeath's EndThe Wandering EarthSupernova Era"Ball LightningThe Redemption of Time (Fan Fiction approved by Cixin Liu)Invisible Planets (Short Story Anthology)The Paper Menagerie and Other StoriesThe Grace of KingsThe Wall of Storms
