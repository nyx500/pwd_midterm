DNF @ 50%The Grace of Kings is a retelling of the fall of the Qin dynasty and subsequent rise of the Han dynasty in ancient China, overlaid with elements from fantasy and steampunk (specifically, airships). Gods also make random appearances in the book because...I honestly don't know why. It just happens.This book is an example of "good idea, poor execution." This could have been an excellent book, but unfortunately it suffers from poor storytelling. Reading this book feels more like an academic exercise than a compelling story. Ken Liu keeps his characters at arm's length throughout the book, making it difficult to form any emotional attachment to them. Side characters randomly appear and disappear.The prose itself is disengaging. Ken Liu relies on telling us what happened rather than showing us what happened. This also creates major problems with the pacing of the story.I rarely DNF books, but this one is such a chore to read. Life is too short, and there are too many other books to read that I will probably enjoy more.
