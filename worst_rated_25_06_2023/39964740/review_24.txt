I got bound.Ouuff, what a story! I was utterly spellbound from the very first words. In this universe where books are dangerous, love is passionate and stories are realities; i lost myself. If only i could bind those past two days of reading this story into a book i would; not to forget but to always remember it. I see myself re/reading this in the future because i would want to feel everything all over again.Go in blind, and get spellbound - in every literal sense to the word.
