H O L Y S H I R T B A L L SThis book is my life. I am stunned by how incredible the writing was, how incredible the characters were, how incredible the storyline is. The Binding is such a unique and interesting book, and as are the ideas that fuelled this book. A book about books, and what amazing books they are. Memories, captured and preserved and taken from a person forever. To be used for good or used for evil, this idea is stunning and I loved reading about it. And then there were the characters. The characters in this book were so beautifully described, and though I may have found Emmett annoying at times, what character isn't? Lucias added a whole new part to this book, and the romance? Well damn, I was about half-way through the book and then suddenly my gaydar was tingling and I was like 'am I sensing something here?'. And damn, what a thing that was. I rarely read such beautiful romantic build-ups, and believe me, I read a lot of books.And god, what a relief to not have an intense cliffhanger at the end. Do yourself a favour and read this book.
