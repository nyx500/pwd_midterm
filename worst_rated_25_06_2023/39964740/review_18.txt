A slow start, but I'm so glad to have continued The Binding, as I ended up really enjoying the rest of the story!“May your darkness be quiet and the light come sooner than you need,”~★~ What is this book about? ~★~Emmett Farmer is plagued by an illness that renders him nearly useless to his family’s livelihood. When he is requested to be a binder’s apprentice, his family believes this is a chance for Emmett to be of use somewhere. Except binders make books of people’s memories they wish to forget- which is why books are forsaken. Emmett knows nothing of binding, and wants nothing to do with the craft, though it seems like the only option left for him. ~★~It was hard for me to connect with this story in the beginning. The intricate descriptions and vague plot set-up had my attention dwindling. I actually considering putting The Binding down, but thankfully I pushed through, and by part two I was hooked!The main thing that captivated me was the characters. Emmett was enticing in his mystery; I loved uncovering bits of his lost past in the same moments he did. The romance was heartbreaking and lovely, taking up a greater portion of this story than I could have anticipated. Thankfully it was well written and unraveled wonderfully!For first person narrative, the writing was surprisingly poignant and graceful. The atmosphere and setting was developed particularly well, I had no trouble establishing the world of The Binding in my head. This unique prose held an incredible amount of potential, and while most of it was delivered well, I was left wanting a tad more in terms of plot. I wished for more information on binding and its history, though otherwise this was a great book.
