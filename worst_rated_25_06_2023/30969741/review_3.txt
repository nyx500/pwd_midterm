This book was the ultimate comfort food for me with its lush prose, soft characters, and romantic fluff. The protagonist is down-to-earth, practical, and sweet, the love interest is endearingly arrogant, and the world is the most whimsical, atmospheric version of autumn. A common criticism seems to be that this is a very average fairy tale, but I actually really enjoyed the quiet simplicity of the narrative. This is not a drawn-out five-book series. It doesn’t try to be anything grander than it is. It’s a simple, nice, magical love story, and it’s freaking cute, so screw it, I’m giving it 5 stars. My only criticism is that I need more fluff.
