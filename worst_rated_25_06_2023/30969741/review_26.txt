I remember once I studied a lot for a math exam and was 200% sure I'd pass but then I actually took the exam. I'm having that feeling now that I've actually finished reading the disaster that was This Book. Rtc, like shit I'm tired, this was supposed to be Good.///Please let there be a Ronan Lynch with a pet raven named Chainsaw, thank you.Buddy read with my favorite wife, Elsie (who I'll tag once I'm less lazy)
