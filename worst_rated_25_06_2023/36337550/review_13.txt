wow. this book is wild! i swear, i spent the majority of the story whispering ‘what the heck is going on???’ to myself over and over. i still dont even think i know what i just read, i just know i really enjoyed it. this is a ‘whodunnit’ unlike anything i have read before. mainly because of how ambitious it is. there are so many characters, each with their own role and secrets, which creates multiple plot layers and forces different outcomes for various events, all while a murder is trying to be solved! not to mention this story isnt told in chronological order. each ‘host’ wakes up at a different point during the same day, with one man reliving that day eight times. its enough to get anyone confused! but the overwhelming amount of content is what makes this story so exciting! there is just so much to grab onto to that the reader is never left empty-handed. additionally, i love the writing. the story feels like the words of someone who has written their entire life (can we take a moment to appreciate that this is a debut?!?). not because its distinctly flashy or clever. if anything, its a very subtle kind of writing style. but its also the writing style of someone who is confident in their ability, and that kind of tone works so well this particular story and genre. i will admit, because this story asks so much by requiring the reader to steadily keep up with everything that is going on (and trust me, theres a lot), you definitely have to be in the right mood/mindset to read this and willing to make the commitment to see this to the end. so if you are looking for a thrilling murder mystery that will constantly keep you on your toes, then this book is exactly what you need!↠ 4.5 stars
