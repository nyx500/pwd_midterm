I really don't know how to write a review for this book. Not because I didn't like it, it was fantastic, but because the plot is so intricate and woven I don't want to give anything away. So let's just say it's the story of Aiden, who wakes with no memory at all, just the word 'Anna' on his lips. He finds he's in the middle of a forest, and then manages to stumble across a murder taking place. Aiden is then destined to relive the same day over and over again, until he can solve the murder of Evelyn Hardcastle.Stuart Turton has done a great job here in his debut novel. As I said the plot is very intricate, but it's never convoluted or confusing, though it may be if you read it over several sittings. My advice is to settle down and read it in a day or two, a big ask I know at over 500 pages, but it would definitely be worth it, just to keep things sharp in your mind. Having said that I found 'The Seven Deaths Of Evelyn Hardcastle' to be one of my best and most rewarding reads this year. Highly recommended.
