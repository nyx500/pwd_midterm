ðŸ–¤ Too little information and you're blind, too much and you're blinded. ðŸ–¤The above-quoted line perfectly captures the mindfu literary puzzle that is The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle. Let's not beat around the bush here, this book is bloody FANTASTIC!I have never been so excited about being so confused whilst reading a book.Turton is a Master. This was completely original, completely out there and completely compelling. I was fully absorbed in every moment and most pleasantly CONFUSED.There is really not much I can say about the plot without risking spoilers. I recommend going into this knowing as little as possible.With this being said, you should be aware of the fact that it is okay to be reading it and not understanding anything that is going on. The longer it goes, the more info you have and therefore the more confusing it can become. It's exceptional in its level of detail. I had many theories over the course of the narrative. Some panned out, others didn't, but I never stopped guessing right up until the very end.If you are looking for a completely unique Mystery, look no further. Stop right here! This is the book you need to read.I cannot wait to read more from Stuart Turton. I am already fan-girling over him after one book. I just love his ingenuity and style. Thank you so much to the publisher, Sourcebooks Landmark, for providing me a copy to read and review. I am blown away!!!
