Well this is awkward. Ok so please donâ€™t @ me, I really wanted to like this. Iâ€™ll take part blame - I didnâ€™t realise the time travel element was quite so heavy, if I had then Iâ€™d probably have skipped it. Too much moving between characters at different parts of the day leaving each other notes and Iâ€™m sat here like what? There are way too many characters. Even with the list in the beginning, it went straight past enjoyment to just hard work. The big twist at the end wasnâ€™t even much cop. It might be because Iâ€™ve seen the Black Mirror episode that is similar in that respect so I was like oh that again. Ok. When we do get the reveal I wanted more info.  why was Anna a murdering psycho? Give me more background! Also forgiving the person who tortured and murdered your sister enough to volunteer to go into a makeshift prison/hell and help/save her?! What the fuck! The whole thing made me tired ðŸ˜‘ The 2 stars are for the beginning, it was quite gripping. ************************Why does the British copy have 7 deaths but the US version has 7 1/2. Where is the extra half death?!
