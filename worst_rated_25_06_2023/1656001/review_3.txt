New week,  New BookTube Video - all about the best (and worst) literary apocalypses to live through!The Written Review  Body and soul. Two different thingsWanderer is a parasite. Her people are parasites. For millions of years, they traveled to new planets, colonized the species and lived out lives in their hosts' bodies. It's about the experience and the journey. When Wanderer (the soul) arrives to Earth, she is placed in an adult female host. What she doesn't know, is that the host is still very much there. Melanie (the host) is desperate. She absolutely refuses to let a little thing like being trapped in her own body by an parasitic alien stop her from getting back to her brother. And soon, Wanderer does not want to go back. She's found a home (and a human) that she wants forever. What was it that made this human love so much more desirable to me than the love of my own kind? Was it...Because these humans hate with so much fury, was the other end of the spectrum that they could love with more heart and zeal and fire? I just adore this book. I've read it once every 2-3 years and enjoyed it every time. This was no exception.Normally, when character who is too good to be true (looking at you, Wanderer), it annoys me.  Not with this book. Wanderer might be nearly perfect, but her internal conflict and the external factors (i.e. Melanie, other humans) provide enough tension to keep her from seeming like a Mary-Sue. This book is a slow build but it is so worth it to me. I love it.It's not the face, but the expressions on it. It's not the voice, but what you say. It's not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it. You are beautiful.Ahhh, my heart is just a melty puddle of goo.Audiobook CommentsRead by Kate Reading - I absolutely loved her last name! She was an excellent reader. This is the first time I listened to it and this was a whole new experience. Really pleasant to listen to.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
