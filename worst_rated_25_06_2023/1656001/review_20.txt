4 stars I enjoyed re-reading The Host so much. I remember loving it when I read it when it first came out (around 12-13 years ago) and when a friend was going to read it I figured it was time for a re-read. The audio was a bit slow paced, as I listen at x2 speed normally, and I was able to listen to this one at x2.5 speed. I loved it just as much this time around. It made me cry more than once and I forgot that it was an emotional one, at least for me. I especially love Ian and Jamie. This made me nostalgic to read some of my old favorites.Audio book source: Libby (library borrow)Story Rating: 4 starsNarrators: Kate Reading Narration Rating: 4 starsGenre: Sci-fi Length: 23 hours
