Even thought it took a while for the book to really get good for me, I still loved it! I really enjoyed that there was definitely no instalove involved, Denna and Mare's relationship was slow moving and slow to start and I really loved that, especially because it was technically against the rules for Denna to be with anyone but her betrothed at this point. The politics interspersed throughout the book really gave it a good overall balance between romance, action, and info-dumps, so I was never too overwhelmed or bored with one over another! Overall I really enjoyed this read and would definitely recommend. Great start to my diversity bingo this year!
