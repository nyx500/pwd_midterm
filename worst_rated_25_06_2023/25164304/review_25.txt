"Of Fire and Stars" is a really excellent YA fantasy f/f read. Adult book writers could take some lessons from the slow burn and chemistry that Coulthurst created between her two leading ladies and is one of the reasons I still read YA. YA authors just often do it better.As fantasy stories go, it's a combination of an alternate Earth, Medieval-like royalty and certain people having an affinity with one of the six gods that includes Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Those with the affinity can use the element their born with for good or bad and, because of this, they are feared by the general public especially when someone with the ability starts killing off royalty.The plot does take awhile to unravel and the characters do build their relationship over numerous encounters so expect a somewhat slow but steady pace.Denna and Mare are both distinct, likable, and interesting three dimensional characters. Mare is an ice-queen, black sheep member of the royal family who wants her freedom above all else while Denna is proper, does what is expected of her, and puts her kingdom and duty first. They are 17/18 but their decisions and actions are those of intelligent, mature women doing the best they can with intense outside pressure and lousy circumstances.The romance between them was really well done as was the mystery and the world building. Action was amped and the story held good suspense on a number of levels.This book is currently available in the Kindle Unlimited program but I listened to its audiobook on Scribd. The story is told in their alternating points of view of Denna and Mare and the two actresses who played each role did a fantastic job. The story was engaging enough but their delivery elevated the text.As a read, I'd say this is 4.5. But, because the narration was so good, I give it a 5.Recommend.
