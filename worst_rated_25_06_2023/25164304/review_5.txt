I really want to get more into f/f books, but nearly all of them are contemporary, which I'm really bored with atm. I picked this up with mahana (hi binch) and read it somewhat on audiobook and somewhat physically, and I really enjoyed it! As a horse owner I was really happy that this centered around a lot of discussion about riding horses and training horses, so it had my attention there. I also loved the character dynamics, the breaking of gender roles, and the general rebellion of the characters and world against norms of fantasy was refreshing. The world itself, however, I thought was a bit dry. It bore no significant differences than any other run of the mill fantasy world out there with a pretty generic elemental magic system. I'm kind of tired of the "I have magic and have to hide it!" trope, so hopefully in book two, Denna will embrace her magic and master it.But Denna and Mare's relationship was so slow burning and lovely, and I loved all the side characters in this, so they kept it afloat. This definitely isn't a stand-out fantasy world, but I fell in love with the characters and the way they were written, and I would definitely recommend this to people looking for f/f romance in non-contemporary settings.
