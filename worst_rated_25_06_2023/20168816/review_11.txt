A hilarious and non-stop 'Thieves' World-style' fantasy that plays out like a relay race. A really violent, backstabbing, dangerous relay race. It plays with all kinds of fantasy tropes, tongue firmly in cheek - but also showcases Abercrombie's talent for economically drawing vivid and compelling characters who quickly come to life in the reader's imagination. Merged review:A MUST for anyone who's a fan of Lynch's 'Gentleman Bastard' series. Although it's an unconnected story, the themes and the sense of humor are the same. A 'retired' infamous thief is blackmailed by a wizard into an improbable heist: she is tasked with stealing a street. Yes, a city street. It's a short street, admittedly, but it's full of homes, commerce and passers-by. How will this be accomplished? Well, first, she has to gather her old gang and get them to help...Clever and entertaining.
