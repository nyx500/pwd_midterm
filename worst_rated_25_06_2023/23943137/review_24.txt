This book was an absolute delight from start to finish. The comparison to Heyer and Susanna Clarke is super apt, I really felt like I was reading a Heyer but without all the annoying stuff, and also there was magic and magic swashbuckling and husband hunting and forceful older ladies who IN SOME CASES are also dragons. It was that feeling of light banter-y goodness with plenty of just-hinted-at angst. I loved every character, everything was perfect, READ IT. Zachary is my darling and Prunella is the classic "hoyden heroine with zero fear of consequences" in the very best way, and their romance is SO CHARMING.There was one thing that bothered me, but it's a pretty big spoiler, the short version is possible TW for transphobia (not sure that's quite the right word but): There was one character who was described as "sexless." This character was referred to as "it" and later died. No one thing was necessarily an issue for me, but in combination some aspects of how this happened and how this character was portrayed really upset me. And unfortunately the death was very close to the end of the book so I came away feeling a little soured even though literally every other moment of the book was perfection.
