I feel like I just read a first draft of a book: poorly written, a rushed plot, and not thoroughly planned at all. The story and writing are juvenile, which would be fine if the author didn't also attempt to be dark and serious (constant cussing, drug-abusive mother, attempts at blood and gore, etc.). The book tries too hard to be gritty when its main character is the embodiment of an angsty Hot Topic teenager. The rest of the characters are just as one-dimensional as her, which makes any affection that they have for each other unbelievable and ridiculous. Despite the attempted theme of blurring the line between Good and Wicked, the story has no actual nuance in morality, leaving just caricatured depictions of villains with no concrete reason for why they are evil, why they should die, and what justifies killing them. Basically, this is a solid 1 star.
