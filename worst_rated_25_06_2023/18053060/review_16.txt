there are many things i say that i like while, in execution, very rarely liking them. you could say that;s my experience with books in general, but that would cause an emotional crisis i'm not prepared for, so let's narrow that down to retellings.i love them. in theory. i think they're cool. in theory. some of our greatest stories, modernized or magic-ized or otherwise changed! but usually they end up either being too much or too little. this was way too much.but it was fun.part of a series i'm doing in which i review books i read a long time ago and reflect on the stupidest concepts imaginable
