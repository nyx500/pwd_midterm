Morwenna grows up in Wales hanging out with faeries. Nothing extraordinary about it, loved the matter of fact telling and how they're precisely as I imagined they’d be. Illusive “They’d moved in with the green things after people had abandoned them” and unfathomable. Some are pretty little things with gossamer wings, others creatures ripped from the pages of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.  “Fairies tend to be either very beautiful or absolutely hideous”  She's 15 with a ton of issues - a mother who’s crackers, the death of her twin, the appearance of her father who’d dropped into her life after years without a whisper, then shipped her off to an English boarding school. A misfit who walks with a cane & talks funny, more comfortable in the company of faeries than people; immersed in the world of books, fantasy & sci-fi in particular. Friendless & lonely, she’s also clever and surprisingly grounded. A strange, gentle story that I should have loved and did for the most part.  “Away with the faeries”  a Gaelic phrase my parents used to describe me. Grew up lost in my own little world so coming across Morwenna felt a bit like finding a soul mate. I’m not daft, never actually spoke to any but whereas Santa left me cold I truly believed in faeries, spent hours hunting for them in neglected places, overgrown fields, derelict buildings. Books were a refuge for me as well, a pint-sized immigrant with a Glaswegian brogue that sent my Canadian classmates into hysterics every time I opened my mouth. cons: Why oh why didn’t she stick with the style she began in, the subtlety of magical realism. Instead you get this outta left field epic ending, unnecessary and jarring. Dropped to  3 ½ stars and rounded to 3  meanderings:  All the references to ‘obscure’ sci-fi & fantasy novels whet my appetite. Roger Zelazny top of my list to try. memorable “I should never have tried to talk to that fairy. Let someone else do something about Dutch elm disease. It isn’t my problem.”
