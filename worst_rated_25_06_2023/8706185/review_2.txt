This is one of those books that I think of frequently, it has stayed with me. Walton has blessed this work with a strong female lead and is minimalistic, meaning that most of the action, what little there is, is subtle and underplayed. Yet it is a hypnotic book to read, Jo Walton does a great job of characterization, economically describing the cast in such a way that the reader knows the populace, yet there are few one dimensional characters. Of course the aspect of the book that gets so much attention (rightfully so) is the ubiquitous references to science fiction literature. Akin to Ernest Cline's novel Ready Player One, the narrative at times takes a back seat to Walton's streaming sci-fi reminiscences. Whereas Cline took us back to the 80s, Walton waxes nostalgic through a list of science fiction and fantasy greats.No wonder now, looking back, that this won the Hugo, it's that good.** 2018 - This is a book for readers. Walton's ongoing list of cool SF books weaved into the storyline and the themes of reading akin to magical realism makes this a very special and fun book. I may need to re-read some time.
