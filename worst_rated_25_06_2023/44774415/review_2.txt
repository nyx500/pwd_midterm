I never knew how much I needed this precious graphic novel about a queer hard-of-hearing witch and a nonbinary werewolf (both Chinese-American) childhood-friends-to-lovers relationship, but WOW, here we are and this is going to be one of my favorite releases of the year, no doubt at all. Because I'm having a hard time putting into normal review formatting how much I loved this, let the bullets do their thing: •	DIVERSITY FOR DAAAAYYYYYS•	Not only are both MCs Chinese-American and queer, but Nova has two grandmas in a relationship with each other, too?! KILLING ME WITH CUTENESS, Y’ALL•	Such sweet and wholesome witchy rep, please give me more stories about good witches interacting with nature and doing sweet protective craft ♥•	This art is adorable, full stop, and can we just take a moment to appreciate the precious quiet detail of Tam’s ears?!•	Tam uses they/them pronouns (and even corrects other characters) and the other characters are so respectful of them!•	Multiple references to Nova’s hearing aids ♥•	Nova’s bestie is the obligatory skeptic character who’s also a trip and ships Nova/Tam so hard, A++ wing-woman over here•	Everything is just so wholesome and precious and we stan 😭I seriously can't recommend this highly enough and I hope everyone picks it up and obsesses over it when it releases this October! 😍🎃🔮Thank you so much to the publisher for providing me with this ARC in exchange for an honest review!
