I see a very adorable graphic novel about witches and sweets, I automatically and unequivocally press 'want to read'.No questions asked.And it was worth it because it was soo cute and funny and lovely! I really loved it!Thank you, NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with an e-copy for an honest review!
