Absolutely stunning artwork, beautiful magic system. However, the plot was extremely weak, the story seemed secondary to characters which in turn made it difficult for me to get attached to them. Romance felt very rushed even though history was indicated, it was off page and so felt more insta-love than anything else. Overachieving, majorly powerful adults who let the teens go risk their lives always baffle me and pull me out of the story with "wait but why". Very cute but a miss for me.
