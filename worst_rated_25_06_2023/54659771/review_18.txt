This didn’t do it for me. The fact that I put this book down not once but twice and had to push myself to finish the rest…The world building wasn’t good - it took me forever to figure out if it was contemporary or fantasy. Honestly, I wish it was fantasy because the 'gods' here are boring. And Hades is wayyyy too nice. I like my H&P retellings with a darker kind of Hades, please and thank you.
