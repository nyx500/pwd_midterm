The Thirteen are the most powerful people in Olympus, they take on the names of the original Gods. Zeus is the most powerful. He is over 50 years old, cruel and has killed his previous 3 wives. Demeter and Zeus worked together to push Persephone into an engagement of Zeus. She couldn’t say no without angering both, but as soon as the engagement is announced she escapes the party and takes off. The Hero(es): Hades - He was one of the thirteen but many think he died. He rules the lower city on the other side of the river Styx. There is a treaty which says that anyone that makes it across one of the bridges over the river Styx belongs to Hades. The Story: While running from Zeus, Persephone finds that two of his minions are following her, and she makes it over one of the bridges to Hades. He captures her and brings him to his home. Let’s start with the narration. I absolutely hated the man’s voice. First it was a man with an British accent. I could be biased, because I am American, but British accents sound a bit too proper for the Lord of the Underworld. His voice isn’t deep enough either. If his voice was deep enough, I wouldn’t mind the accent but he sounded a bit foppish as is. Also his female voice was horrendous.The female narrator had a perfect voice for Persephone. She also had a British accent and sounded a bit like Felicity Jones. I liked her quite a lot, but her voice for Hades was also horrendous. I wish when they have dual narrators, they would have the males read all the male lines and female all the female lines no matter whose POV the chapter is in. The story was good, the romance was both romantic and super steamy. Though I did think it was odd that Hades was such a good guy and Zeus such a bad guy (though he wasn’t all that different in the myths). I was expecting Hades to be much darker than he was. Though I did like Hades as a person. The only real criticism I have with the story is the fact that it wasn’t really clear about the fact that when each of the thirteen die, someone eventually takes their place and name. For instance Persephone grew up on a farm until her mother became Demeter and with that she owned a high rise in the upper city of Olympus. So how do they get to be one of the thirteen and are they Gods in some way or just the richest & most powerful (which is what I thought), but then if that is true, how are they chosen? I did like how the author pieced in different parts of the myth into the story. Like the River Styx, the pomegranate (in the myth Persephone is not supposed to eat in the underworld and she eats six pomegranate seeds), the bargain with Demeter (where because Persephone ate six seeds she ends up spending six months with her mother and six with Hades every year), Charon (the ferryman to the underworld) and Cerberus (the three headed dog). I won’t tell how any of these things are incorporated into the story, but I loved that these and more were included. I voluntarily read & reviewed an advanced copy of this book.
