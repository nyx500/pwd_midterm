I don't know what my problem is with writing this review, I have been finished with the book for about 3 days and I just keep putting it off. I believe the cause to be I didn't like the book as much as I had hoped too. The cover is absolutely gorgeous, the imagery is beautiful, the writing flows; then what is the problem, why did I not enjoy it?In part, the length. It was very time consuming, at times it felt like I could have skipped ahead 30 pages and not really missed anything important. Also, it lacked originality to a point. Yes, it's a retelling, but I didn't feel like there was anything amazingly new here. It was more an interpretation. I feel like it just lacked a certain wow factor, that bit of pizzaz to really hook you in and keep you interested. And, their names were cutish, but mostly distracting, i.e. Azalea, Clover, etc. I sound 100% like I disliked this story, but I really didn't. It was beautiful in it's own (slow) way. It is the story of the 12 sisters who dance at night as part of a curse. They are in mourning of their passing Mother, so dancing is forbidden. They love to dance so naturally they find a magical portal to a special place, gaurded by Keeper to dance the night away and keep it a secret. Spoken Oaths are formed to make their whereabouts secret. The King (their father) knows something is going on. He calls a quest of sorts to the gentlemen of the area, to find out where these girls are wandering off to dance. It all is very dramatic and twisted when the boys come-a-calling and start falling in love. They find out who keeper really is and what his curse truely is and.... how he is going to break it. Lives are in danger as these sisters cross from real world to magic world making reality somewhere in between. 3.5 stars Enjoyable yet lengthy.
