4.5 starsEntwined is a retelling of the German fairy tale, The Twelve Dancing Princesses. I'm gonna be honest here, it's never been one of my favorites. Shhhh!However, this author manages to take a rather thin story about...well, twelve dancing princesses, and turn it into something really interesting! In fact, other than Bella at Midnight, this is probably my favorite retelling.There's magic, romance, an evil villain, a cursed castle, daddy issues, sisterly love, a rug that likes to eat people, and yes...dancing. This story has it all!As an added bonus, the author doesn't bore you to death describing scenery!
