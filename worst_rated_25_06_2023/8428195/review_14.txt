" Too young to attend the annual—and only—ball the royal family hosted, Azalea and her ten younger sisters gathered all the blankets and cloaks and shawls from the palace and hid outside the ballroom windows. Azalea remembered the frigid air, how the rosebushes scratched, and how they had to huddle together for warmth. The ballroom radiated gold through the frozen panes. The girls pressed their noses on the glass and oohed at the dancers, especially Mother, who danced like an angel."Entwined by Heather Dixon WallworkEntwined, for those who have never heard of this one, is a retelling of the classic Fairy Take, "The twelve dancing princesses". And the story is as luscious as the cover art.This was not my first quest to read a retelling of this story. I had first read "Princes of the Midnight Ball" but did not care for it. It was way to YA, light and nothing happened for much of the book.Not so this one! It is a bit darker than the formerly mentioned one and that was exactly what I was seeking. It pays homage to the original while still making the modern version a charming, engaging story while also incorporating a wee bit of darkness. It had just the right degree of darkness while still losing none of the mystique of the original storyIt was an enthralling retelling. I think what I liked best was the pace. It's the perfect length, did not bore me and was much fun to read.I also like that the sisters all had differences to them and not one character just faded into the woodwork. I almost did not read this because I was so let d own by the other one I'd read but I am glad I gave this a try and if you like different takes on classic Fairy Tales, I'd highly recommend Entwined.
