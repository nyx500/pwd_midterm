Magic is not always formed from words, from cauldrons being spiced or black cats strolling down dark alleys. Some curses are manifested from desire or injustice.  Story 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Many years ago three girls lived in Sparrow. They were beautiful, enchanting and were making the men of Sparrow go crazy. Their names were Aurora, Marguerite and Hazel Swan. The people of Sparrow believed the three girls to be witches - so they drowned them in the sea. Every year from this day on the swan sisters returned to the island - to occupy the body of a girl their age and make a boy fall in love with them - only to be drowned in the dark ocean.But this year something is different. Penny - whose father disappeared one day and never came back - finds a stranger in Sparrow who asks for work. But strangers are not welcome here. But something is different about him. He is different. Stronger. And he wants to stay. So she gives him work, a place to stay. Maybe he’ll survive it. Maybe they’re all going to survive this year without drowning boys and singing sisters. Maybe. Maybe not. My friend Mary told me about this beautiful, magical story that felt like a fairytale with love and a fascinating atmosphere in it. And what can I say? She was totally right. I loved this book from the start. The writing was so beautiful and the characters were perfectly picked for this story. This is now one of my favorite standalone ever. ♥️Character 🌟🌟🌟🌟First of all - the swan sisters - evil “witches” who lure boys into the deep ocean so they finally can have revenge for their own deaths. They were my favorite. I have a special place inside my heart for villains/witches/bad people. It’s probably pretty dark inside this part, but who cares. They were interesting with their own personalities and past. They were really greatly written “villains” of the story, because in some way you felt sorry for them - for being accused of being evil witches and being drowned by people who needed an excuse for their illoyal husbands. Then there was our handsome stranger with green eyes - Bo. In the beginning he’s a total mystery - with his secrets, past and thoughts. But then he revealed bits of himself and you totally fall in love with him. He’s a quiet one, but he has a loyal big heart. Penny - our main character - was a little bit strange in the beginning, but in the end I loved all of them. I think the author did a great job of creating this characters that fit perfectly into this story and add some mysterious vibes to the atmosphere. Relationships 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟I once read a poem about love being fragile, as thin as glass and easily broken. But that is not the kind of love that survives in a place like this.  Oh, we all know what was going to happen between Bo and Penny. But who cares? It was so freakin sweet and magical and ugh. I loved it. I didn’t think it was rushed. It’s teenage love, you guys, that’s what’s happening if there are a evil witches and drowning people around you. Also it was so tragic, dramatic and I’m a sucker for sacrifice. I loved it soooooo much.Writing style 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟The writing was so magical, beautiful and I couldn’t stop reading. I was sucked into another world, a darker fascinating world with curses, a deep frightening ocean and evil witches and townspeople in it. It was written in Pennys POV and every few chapters there were parts of the past - the past were the swan sisters lived and died. I can definitely recommend this book for people that need a break from the outside world and need some time in a dark story with a luring world. ✨And it has tilted my universe off center, the frayed edges of my life starting to unravel. Loving someone is dangerous. It gives you something to lose.  ___________________________________________________Because my girl Mary was completely in love with this book.
