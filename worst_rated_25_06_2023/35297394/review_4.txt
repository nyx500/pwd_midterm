wow. okay. so first it was a book about rival viking clans, and now its a story about sister witches dying for revenge. how is it that im enjoying all the books i swore i would hate!? i guess all the times i said ‘new year, new me’ made it come true. lolol.the absolute strength of this book lies in its atmosphere. its not exactly enchanting, because the story is actually quite dark. but there is something so captivating about a haunted sea-side town, a two century old curse, and three witches back from the dead. the writing easily transports the reader into this world, filled with mysteries and secrets, and that alone is worth it to me. and although there is much to enjoy about this, its not without its faults. the storyline is a bit predicable, there is massive case of insta-love, and the reader is not really given an opportunity to know the characters. i understand why all of these are present in the book, but i cant help but think the story could have been elevated had it been a little more developed across the board. but, goodness me, i really wish i had read this back in october. the hocus pocus vibes in this book are off the charts. if youre a fan of witches, i highly recommend this!↠ 3.5 stars
