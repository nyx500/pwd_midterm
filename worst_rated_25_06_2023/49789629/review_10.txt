"Love is an act of loyalty."Immanuelle Moore, raised by her Grandparents and bearing her grandfather's last name bears the shame of being a child out of wedlock, a child with dark powers, a child that follows the rules but has a destiny that will affect them all."To be a woman is to be a sacrifice."Growing up in the town of Bethel, where the Prophet rules, Immanuelle tries to follow the father, she tries to worship, be devoted, submissive and conform as all the women of the village do. Until one day, fate brings her into the Darkwood, a forbidden place where the spirits of dead witches live, witches who give her a journal that once belonged to her Mother....BLOOD... BLIGHT...DARKNESS....SLAUGHTERAnd we're off on another dark and magnificent witch ride dystopian style. Grab those brooms and fly away to the wondrous dark world that Alexis Henderson has created. Immanuelle is a strong and brave character who will not be a victim, even when knocked down she will fight, she is loyal, she is strong and she is ready to take on the powers that be. I found this to be a very fast engrossing read which had me on the edge of my seat, not wanting to put this down. The ending was intense (who can see this being made into a movie?) Plus, I'm with other reviewers feel/want/hope for a sequel. Readers are not left hanging at the end of this book and yet, I wanted more!Besides having a riveting story-line, this book is full of beautiful passages such as:"Sometimes I wonder if my secrets are better swallowed than spoken. Perhaps my truths have done enough harm. Perhaps I should take my memories to the grave and let the dead judge my sins."I love a good witch tale and was not disappointed. Fans of witches, dystopian tales, dark tales, beautiful writing and strong female protagonists look no further. I received a copy of this book from the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. All the thoughts and opinions are my own.
