I'm re-reading this book now and, is it just me or does it seem like OSC could actually WRITE BETTER back then?He doesn't write like this anymore. Now his books are the conservative lecturing version of the Anita Blake serious where instead of sex scenes after sex scenes you get characters nagging about morality and marriage.Also, why do folks insist on being so dang cruel to kids? Hitting them with hazel rods and smacking then and such? I don't get that.What I also don't get is, why do people allow religion to separate them anyway? I always think the bonds between people are more important than any religion at all ever.Now the actual review.OSC what HAPPENED to you? You used to know how to write! This was the first book I read by you. It shaped my paradigm. If there was any lecturing about family values it was SUBTLE. You even had a character who wasn't religious and didn't vilify him. You showed him as a loving father who loved his wife but just didn't want to go to church. You used to be able to tell a good, strong story full of awesome images.Now it's just nag nag nag. It's too depressing to compare this book to Ender in Exile. That book just isn't as strong because every character is taken over to lecture the audience, and who wants that?I do not. I want a good book.Like this one! May 10, 2014. Read it again. It's still good. It doesn't fill me with rage the way Ender's Game does or Lost Boys or so many other books I liked by OSC one does. Why can't he still write this way?
