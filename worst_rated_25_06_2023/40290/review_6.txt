Let's start by the good things in this book:-I like how Scott Card uses language to convey a whole place and moment in time. -I think that, although the ending is open enough to leave important questions unanswered, there's a level of satisfaction about it that makes for a good closure (for all those, like me, who don't plan to read the whole series, more about that on the things i didn't like).-There are glimpses of what cultural assimilation means for those who had been conquered showing the tragic reality of what displacement and genocide means, but of course as Mr. Card is not in the business of accepting that's exactly what happened in this reality based-fantasy, it's all reduce to that, glimpses.Now about the things I didn't like:-The portray of Native Americans as nothing else but useless drunks.-The flimsy cover of religious indoctrination presented through the story.-The imposture of European traditions and superstitions as the sole reality.All that say, I must come clean and accept the book is easy to read and entertaining. It has some interesting moments and Card surely knows how to create full and well rounded characters.Now, if you're curious about what the story is about and so on, I'm sure there are many places where you can find a nice and complete synopsis. Here I just wanted to talk about the reasons why I won't be reading anymore books in this series.
