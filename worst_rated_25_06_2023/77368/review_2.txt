This could have been an interesting retelling of Sleeping Beauty. McKinley had some good ideas, but the plot rambled along at such a boring pace that it's hard to remember what they were. Long-winded and useless descriptions of every mundane thing you can imagine were a huge part of what bogged the book down. I think if it had been chopped down to 150 or 200 pages, it would have made a pretty decent story. At 400 plus pages? Not so much.I also thought that the fact that her love interest was 20 to 30 years older than her (and had watched her grow up from an infant) was kind of creepy. P.S. Was Narl really the best name she could come up with for the guy? Narl?!
