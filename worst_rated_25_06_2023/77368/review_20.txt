I wanted to like this, I really did. Robin McKinley was one of my favorite childhood authors, so I felt like it was time to read some of her novels that I haven't read. Here's the thing about Robin McKinley, her books are either amazing ("Sunshine", "Hero and the Crown", "Beauty") or quite frankly just suck. Unfortunately, this book falls into the latter.Spindle's End is a retelling of the story of "Sleeping Beauty" and by retelling I mean like borderline plagiarizing (think Melania & Michelle Obama's speeches). Almost nothing in the story is really that creative. That said, I absolutely enjoyed the first 75 pages or so. Her world-building is great and really gives a sound base for her to build her story off of. The only thing is, the story really doesn't take off. The characters really don't evolve. Everything basically stays the same with absolutely no action. And, her writing becomes over-descriptive to the point where you want to smack the editor for not doing a better job.Although this is a retelling, the ending was beyond predictable (I know this is somewhat expected when reading a retelling). I would just pass on this one. I have a feeling Robin and I won't be seeing too much of each other for a little while.
