What I Liked• I enjoyed that the story followed the making of a villain rather than the making of a hero. • Overall, I liked Xifeng as the main character. Her focus was less on romance and more on her end goals. What I Disliked• I didn't really love the writing. There were times that it was very nice and other times that I just didn't vibe with it. The quality wasn't consistent. • The pacing of the story. The beginning felt too long and the end felt too rushed. • I really did not like Wei and I could not figure out why Xifeng was so bent out of shape over him. He was possessive and kind of the worst.
