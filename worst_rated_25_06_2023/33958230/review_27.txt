*3.5/5 stars*“She would bloom where she was planted and let her roots close around the throats of her enemies.” I was always intrigued by stories of villains or anti heroes in fantasy books. And I think it's something the YA genre needs more of, because it has so much potential to be different from many other generic - or too similar - books in the genre. Coming into this book, I didn't realize it would be so reminiscent of Snow White from the evil queen's point of view. It's not the same and I'm not even sure if the author meant it to be a sort of retelling of that particular fairy tale, but I really liked how the story had some similar elements, but still was esentially its own. The Asian inspired setting was beautifully described and magical and one of the best points of the story. In terms of lush world building combined with rather slow paced storyline, I'd recommend this books to fans of Renee Ahdieh. Of course I enjoyed the moral greyness of the main character, Xifeng. But at the same time, I have to say I really disliked her. It's kind of understandable - and intentional - since she's the future villain, but.. Normally I either love a good villain, or at least love to hate him/her. And if the story is about the origin of a villlain, I want to understand her, to feel for her somehow. Like I felt, for example, for Adelina Amouteru from The Young Elites. That story ripped my heart right out. But this, I felt either indifferent towards Xifeng, or outright hated her. I mean, she was so so vain. So woman hating, so self absorbed, judgmental, hypocrytical and thoroughly unlikeable to me from the beginning. And it just got worse. So I guess I did like the promise of evil queen origin retelling, and I did like it on the surface, but I didn't always (or most of the time) enjoy reading from her view. “The beauty of this world is fading all too fast through the cruelty and thoughtlessness of men.” As for the side characters, no one really stood out to me. There was some little bit of romance as well, but it didn't take the center stage of the story at all, for which I was grateful. All in all, I didn't care for the love interest as a character, nor for the bits of romance. The pacing of this book was also a bit of a struggle for me. It was very slow and uneventful, for the most part.Overall, I liked the world buidling and the premise of the story. I like morally grey character and fairy tale retellings. Xifeng was an interesting future villain, but a horrible person and reading from her view was unpleasant for me. Recommended for those who, like me, want to read more YA books focused on female villains.“She knew her own worth. She would seize her destiny with all the strength and spirit within her, and bend them all to her will: every man kneeling and every woman overshadowed.”  *****************************Some great YA books centered on morallly grey main characters that I would also recommend: The Young Elites, Cruel Beauty, Fairest, Heartless, The Diabolic.
