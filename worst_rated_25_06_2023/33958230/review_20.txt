*rubs temples* I really wish I liked this because I was really looking forward to this, but, I'm sorry friends, I was not a fan (and at most, 'it was ok'). - First, I found the worldbuilding... weird. Indeed, it is Asian-inspired, but I felt liked what made it 'Asian-inspired' was superficial and inconsistent. I don't believe that the story should embody an essentialist notion of 'Chineseness'/'Asianness', but it should be consistent, immersive, and rich - which it was not. - I couldn't get invested in Xifeng as an antiheroine - or a character. I felt like her characterization was inconsistent; at times her values and what she would vs. wouldn't do confused me. I think her 'inner conflict' could have been better written. Unfortunately because of this, I didn't feel very invested in the story or Xifeng's emotional journey. When bad things happened, I just thought, eh, she'll be alright. - The emotional conflicts really felt like non-conflicts. - Many of the characters in the story had so much potential to be fascinating and fleshed out characters, but I found that the boring (and predictable) ones were developed instead. - I felt like the writing lacked... an active tense. The writing seemed passive in some instances, and so I found it difficult to get invested, or when something big and important happened, it didn't feel big and important at all.- The romance was lacking. For one, I didn't feel the chemistry between Xifeng and Wei, nor did I feel like Xifeng really cared at all, despite her saying so and how possessive and selfish she felt about him. And so, when she felt heartbroken towards the end of the book, I was like, she sure is dramatic about someone she doesn't care about.Trigger warnings: physical abuse, violence, murder, gore, mutilation, intended rape
