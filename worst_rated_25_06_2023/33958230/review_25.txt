3.5 starsAhhh, this was a pretty solid debut novel, and a great start of a promising series! Forest of a Thousand Lanterns is an East Asian retelling of the Evil Queen's origin story before she became Snow White's stepmother, and it is everything I wanted it to be.First of all, SHE DOESN'T BECOME EVIL BECAUSE OF A DUDE. I love my villains and I am a sucker for a good origin story, but my main pet peeve is when a female villain becomes evil because a guy wronged her. Sure, there's a guy in here, but there are so many factors contributing to Xifeng's embracing the darkness and it was really well done. Her descent was well developed and thought out.Which may make my complaint seem a bit contradictory, but at times, this book felt really long. According to Goodreads, it's not even over 400 pages, but I honestly felt like I was reading a 500-page tome sometimes. There was so much information to suck up, and yes, this does result in quite a rich world-building, but... I think I would've been happier with less. It didn't read as smoothly.I did really love the mythology and the stories everyone told. The characters were nicely fleshed out as well. I did guess some of the things that were coming, but the road was still an enjoyable one.Overall, I'd really recommend this to fans of fantasy, villains, and retellings. You will find it very hard to resist Xifeng's lure.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with a copy
