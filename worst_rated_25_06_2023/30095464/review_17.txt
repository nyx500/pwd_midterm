I avoided this after some negative early reviews. What a mistake! This book is awesome. It is character focused. If you're only interested in break neck speed plotting with paper thin characters don't bother with this one.But if you love original fantasy novels that spend time developing the character and world you will appreciate this awesome novel.The main character is something of an anti-hero which I appreciated. The majority of the book is about the MC finding her own power and it reminded me a lot of the first half of Memoir of a Geisha in this regard- not a great deal "happened" but I never felt bored. The majority of her origin story is a mystery told in duel time period narratives (Think Name of the Wind in terms of structure/ style). I'm excited for the two timelines to meet in the middle. I'm hoping the second book is where we find out the rest of Tea's backstory- so she can kick ass in the final book without any back and forth. There is very little romance, although I'd guessed who she was bringing back to life in the final chapter long before she did it. I'm excited and hopeful about how the author will develop the romance because I felt the development of Tea's crush in this book was pretty thin (which made sense given the final reveal). Some passages were a little too descriptive but don't let that deter you. It is so rare to find fantasy novels that put this much effort into world building or attempt to step outside the medieval standards. Any missteps are minor in comparison to what was done well. And so much was.Dialogue, characterisation, tension, prose, and plot were all excellent. I only wish it had been longer. I'm desperate for the sequel. It is also a perfect example of how to do a cliffhanger well- the story has resolution even thou it is obvious that the best is yet to come. If you are on the fence about this one or haven't come across it give it a try. This novel is fantastic.
