Honestly just found this to be *fine*. That’s all. I have little to say on it besides it was slow and I wasn’t invested in the characters enough to make up for that. I also expected more of an atmosphere with its emphasis on necromancy and monster but alas, it was nonexistent. It wasn’t bad, the writing was lovely in its descriptions, but otherwise I’ll probably just move on from it very quickly.
