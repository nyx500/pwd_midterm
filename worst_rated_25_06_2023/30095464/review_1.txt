When people cut us, we are expected to do only two things: smile and bleed.Tea, a young girl in a poor village, comes from a family of witches. She always imagined her powers to be similar to her family - something domestic and heartwarming.But...when her brother returns from the war, dead, and then comes back to life...Tea realizes her powers are far more sinister than she ever imagined. We can endure any amount of sadness for the people we love.Tea is a bone witch - part of a dying clan. She finds a mentor who is willing to train Tea to become an asha (master of her craft). Sometimes it is good to remind ourselves how bitterness tastes.But the road to becoming an asha is long, and fraught with peril.But endure it she must, for without the Bone Witches to kill resurrected monsters, her entire country could collapse in a minute.There is no greater strength than the ability to understand and accept your own flaws.Chupeco's writing is simply enchanting. Who knew I could fall so hard for a necromancy book??I absolutely loved (loved) the world created by Chupeco. Her imagery truly transports you to another world.The way she teased out clues for the way magic worked and built her world - in a word - Masterful. I adored Tea's brother, puzzling out the mystery of Tea's mentor and (of course) the strong-but-silent Tea. She was such a unique character!I am always a huge fan of monsters and this book did not disappoint. I especially enjoyed the way her monsters changed and developed from our initial impressions!However, I do feel that the book focused a bit too much on asha training. The beginning and the end held me absolutely riveted...and the intricacies of the dance and tea cermonies for her training...just didn't compare to the killing undead monsters.That being said, I absolutely adore anything Chupeco and am wholly committed to reading this sequel! Cannot wait!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
