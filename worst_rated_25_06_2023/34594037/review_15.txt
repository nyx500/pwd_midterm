Remember when The Magicians came on the scene and it was touted as "Harry Potter for Grownups" but was actually "Someone's Bitter They Never Got to Go to Hogwarts or Narnia?"This book is ACTUALLY Harry Potter for Grownups! With a healthy dose of Hardboiled PI Investigates Murder!Ivy Gamble is basically Petunia Dursley: the sister of a gifted mage, who had to suffer through the slings and arrows of regular high school, while her twin went to Super Special Magic School and came home prettier . . . as well as smug and mysterious. It's enough to drive anyone to drink! And so hard-drinking, lonely Ivy has become a private investigator . . . who is hired to solve a brutal murder at the school where her sister is a star teacher. Did one of the faculty do it? One of the students? Was it a spell gone wrong?The mystery was delightfully twisty, the characters were great, the world building . . . and that's why I'm sad now! I wanted more! So much more! I could have read about everyone and their school and Ivy's other cases for days and days! Gailey was having great fun here, and I would love to see them keep on having fun in this world!
