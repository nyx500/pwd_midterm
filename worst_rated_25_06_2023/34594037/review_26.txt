I really enjoyed reading this. A mystery set at a magic school is right up my alley, particularly because the detective, Ivy, is distinctively non-magical and has to solve a case at the school where her estranged twin is teaching. I liked Ivy's voice, and I was particularly drawn into the descriptions of how ordinary the magical high school is (there are several passages about Being a Teenager that rang true and that I appreciated). The author gets away with never quite explaining the rules of the magic system, which ends up being fine because the book is really about all of the relationships that exist with magic as a complicating, background factor. Unfortunately, the mystery ends up being unsatisfying, and it almost felt like there were 10-15 pages missing from the end of the book. I understood Ivy's decision to walk away given the identity of the killer, but I wanted to see her explain that to Torres. There's so much setup in the first part of the book about how Ivy can never give her clients what they actually want, and how each and every choice is consequential, and I don't think that either of those themes came through in the ending sequences of the book. Even Ivy's own hangups about her lack of magical talent aren't resolved. That's realistic, but it felt like she was working through that through her relationship with Rahul, and that ending conversation doesn't appear in the book either. I think if the ending would have been much more satisfying with either (1) a conversation with Torres that wrapped up the mystery, or (2) a conversation with Rahul that decided the relationship. Having both left up in the air felt a little odd.
