I desperately wanted to love it. It was a tragedy in the making.First, some things I liked Rahul, the main love interest: He must be protectedMagic teenagers being teenagers: YES magic teens would definitely use their magic for the most utterly juvenile things, including lots of penis clouds. A very strong bit of world building from Gailey.And then... the badAlas, ear wax: I find it... insufferable when books reference Harry Potter more than the teensiest amount. This book was, in part, a correction to some of the misteps of the Harry Potter series (see juvenile teens, above). But whyyyy did this particular school for magic children have to exist in a world in which the Harry Potter series ALSO exists? It made for some cringey jokes, annoying references, and it also kind of breaks some of the logic of the world... There doesn't seem to be much care for secrecy among the mages of this world, and it seems to me like the worldwide phenomenon of Harry Potter could very well trigger a "world's colide" type event. But mostly, it was just annoyingBoring and unlikable: I can get behind an unlikable protagonist, ESPECIALLY if it's an unlikable lady. But if a character is unlikable because they're just boring? Whew boy, that makes a book a tedious slog. If all of the supporting characters (besides Rahul! I love you Rahul!) are also unlikable and boring? Oh dear.They are LIARS who LIE!!!111!: I GET IT. 1. It felt corny how frequently the ~unreliable narrator~ stuff was referenced. But also, they don't...? Really...? Lie...? There was never an instance where this was particularly meaningful to the book. The narrator isn't ever actually unreliable.Again, I wanted to like this so much. But I didn't.
