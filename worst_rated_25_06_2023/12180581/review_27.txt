REVIEWI read these three books back-to-back-to-back on my Kindle. The story had me so engaged, that I could not put it down. I was reading in the car, at school, on my bed, at the dinner table, and in the media room. You could call it an obsession.In this paranormal tale, Wendy learns at the age of seventeen that she is a troll. Oh, but she isn’t just ANY troll, her past is filled with mystery, deceit, and some unexpected ancestors. Amanda Hocking carefully twisted this plot with all sorts of surprises. I guarantee that you have not read a series quite like this before.Plain and simple – Wendy rocks! She starts out unsure and confused. I mean, who wouldn’t be questioning things if they just found out they were a troll. The beauty lies in how Wendy grows and changes. As her confidence grows, she becomes the girl (err troll) she was always meant to be.Let’s talk romance. Wendy has more boy trolls after her than she keep track of. They are all nice in their own way, but they each have their unique traits. Finn is protective. Loki is a flirt. Tove is like a brother. I loved them all.If you are looking for a battle, you have come to the right place. Amanda Hocking has written some of the most epic battle scenes ever. Sure these scenes are filled with the physical battle, but they also contain the emotions behind the fight. They were so real that I could FEEL them.This series about trolls surprised and entertained me. I will definitely be looking for more Amanda Hocking books to read.RATING5 LovedCOVER COMMENTSI like how the covers are so similar and work together to tell the story. I also love the turquoise and black because it has a mysterious feel to it.
