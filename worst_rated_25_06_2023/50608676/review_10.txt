Imagine the X-Men in a fantastical ancient Africa, on a wild roadtrip through nonstop magical terrors.It started a bit slow for me, but by 200 pages in, I was hooked. I'll be thinking about this one for a long time. Can't wait for the sequels and the movie. The violence in this book (especially the ceaseless sexual violence) can be very challenging and disturbing, but I think it makes a strong point that written violence should feel disturbing. It shouldn't be easy to gloss over the battles. Violence shouldn't ever feel anodyne. But it can make for very tough reading at parts.There's a lot to think about here with the ways that histories of Africa and African peoples, tropes, and cultures from different parts of the content are freely mixed. It's worth talking about when and how that might be problematic, but I'm going to stay away from all that here because the end result was such an incredible world. I hope this book inspires people to read more pre-colonial African history and learn about the diversity in the continent today, especially how different the regions are.The book is amazing overall. Go read it.
