THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A LOT OF SWEARING. YOU ARE WARNEDFirst and foremost, I’d like to apologize to the author I meant no disrespect sis I just hate this I’m sorry and for those who enjoyed this book, good for you but I can’t relate. 1.5 StarsWHAT THE FUCK. I said those three words every 5 minutes while I read this mess of a book. Seriously tho what the fuck did I just read. I am beyond disappointed and angry and frustrated. I want my time back. I could’ve been reading some good shit but nooooooo. As someone who LOVED cruel beauty this was a major disappointment and such a let down that I deadass threw this book across the room while I screamed in frustrationWhat I liked: 1. The writing was as pretty as it is fucking confusing. But still prettyWhat I didn’t like: 1.RachelleI have never ever ever ever read a character so near sighted, so stupid, and so brash and did I mention SO FUCKING STUPID. JUST HOW NEAR SIGHTED AND STUPID AND EASILY MANIPULATED ARE YOU? DO YOU EVEN HAVE A BRAIN YOU PEA HEADED LITTLE SHIT2.The romance One second she hate this dude then she told him she loved him and then she kissed him. AN HOUR LATER, (literally an hour later in the book) she went and fucked another guy she hated. Ok bitch the fuck? Go choke on his dick3.The world building and the plot and the story itselfJust what the fuck was going on and just what the fuck is everything? This book made me feel dumb as fuck I didn’t even know what the fuck was going on. I mean I love complex plots and worldbuilding and shit but this one is just ugh. I mean I get it, as a writer my imagination can get wild and shit but sis don’t I deserve a bit of explanation on what the fuck is going on because 430 pages later I’m still lost 4.Character developmentShitty person becomes less shitty because she’s so brave yay my hero. No go to hell Rachelle 5.The endingOk I read 430 pages for that. Ok wHAT THE FUCK THAT WAS SHITTY AS SHITTY COMES 6. “Red riding hood retelling”BITCH WHERE? WHAT RETELLING? THERES NO WOLF NO GRANDMA NO SHIT. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS AS CLOSE AS RED RIDING HOOD IS THE FACT THAT SHE WORE A RED DRESS. THATS IT. THAT LITERALLY IS IT. ISSA COMPLETELY NEW STORY. I want what the author was smoking when she wrote this because who the fuck sits down and think this is a retelling of red riding hood? 7. The disability repHe literally is nothing but a dude with two stumps instead of a hand. No personality no nothing. Oh and how Can I forget that one time where the main character decides to insult the disabled dude and he just laughed it off because he was oh so in love with her. Like what.the.fuck8.Just everything about this book Ok let me go chug a whole bottle of vodka and smoke a pack of cig. I’m out
