I need to have a shirt made, with ROSAMUND HODGE IS FUCKING BRILLIANT printed on it. Crimson Bound has one of the most unique imaginative worlds I've ever come across. It's dark, it's vicious, and it's so me. It's going to be so you, too, I swear.Other than the world-building, I would also give two thumbs up for Rosamund's elegant writing. And it's not the boring kind of elegant, either--it's the mesmerizing kind that'll just suck you into the story.Rachelle was such a different heroine from what I'm used to. There were times when she wallowed up in self-pity, and there were times when she came out strong and fierce. I liked that she wasn't just a one-dimensional character and had a lot more to her than you'd think at first.The romance was fine and took a backseat in this one. I was hoping for a little more development and a lot less love-triangle, but I wasn't bothered too much by this aspect because the story's main focus was on the action and adventure, which I adored.I would definitely recommend this one to anyone looking for a dark, mysterious, and unique retelling.
