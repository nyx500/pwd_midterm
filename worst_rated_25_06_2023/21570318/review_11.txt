*sighs* How I love retelling and fairy-tale. This book is a bit bored in the first half, but the last half just pick up and turn SO GOOD! I really like the idea and the writing style of this author! How she create her retelling with the references of myth or other stuff. I might not love this one as mush as Cruel Beauty But still like it very much! Love her romance. This one still not disappointed me about romance, the characters are just interesting and fascinating. I think my taste suit with her works. eiei I crave for more of her book! Why she didn't write more of this series? *sobs*
