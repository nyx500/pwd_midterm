**3.5-stars**I absolutely flew through City of Ghosts, but honestly, I was hoping for a bit more from the spooky Middle Grade story.I did love the premise and am planning to continue on with the series, however, while it was good, I never felt truly immersed.I actually read quite a bit of Middle Grade and for me, this was lacking the level of humor and fun that I am used to seeing in similar stories within the genre. I know this is supposed to be darker, as far as content, but it still could have had more humorous banter, or something to keep me engaged.Confession: While Victoria Schwab is a beloved author, this is actually the first book I have ever read from her.Her writing is great. Very fluid and experienced, but for Middle Grade, something about it just never clicked for me. Again, the premise is strong. I love the idea of Cassidy's parents being Paranormal Investigators. That's definitely a buzzword for me. The whole concept of their television series and having to travel to different locations for filming is so exciting; opening up numerous directions for this series to go in. I also enjoyed that Cass can actually see ghosts, and interact with them, even though no one else in her family can. I think maybe as the series continues, the plots will become more involved and perhaps we will have more of a chance to connect with the characters.Overall, I feel this is definitely a good book and a solid start to a series. Obviously, I am not the intended audience for this, so a room full of Middle Graders may have a completely different opinion than me. I think if this concept sounds interesting to you, pick it up and give it a shot!
