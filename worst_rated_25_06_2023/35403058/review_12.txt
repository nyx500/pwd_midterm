that's it, its official, schwab is an actual queen that can literally write ANYTHING - this book felt like a mix of vicious and the archived series but with a middle grade tone and i am so here for it- i love my soft precious ghost son ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­- i love cassidy as a main character, her voice is so strong but she fits her age and is the middle grade queen we all stan- THIS ALSO FELT LIKE LOCKWOOD AND CO. TO ME LIKE GHOSTING HUNTING KIDS, YES I NEED MORE- dont be deceived by the target audience, this book reached some creepy heights (to me, an actual Babyâ„¢) and i couldnt read it in the dark wow this is sad- im literally in love with victoria schwab's writing, shes writes so magical and seamless, i just dont know how its possible- MORE FEMALE FRIENDSHIPS PLEASE I LOVE LARA- despite how much i loved the book, i did find the plot to be underdeveloped in the technical sense that its more of an introduction than anything- i feel like the coming books will be much stronger bc they have this background to build off from, and so the hopes are high - but really its a fun, easy, quick read about creepy ghosts - i can't wait to see more of the adventures cassidy and her family go on AND LIKE I NEED JACOB'S BACKSTORY ASAP - i just really love that little boy, he needs protecting guys i CANNOT WAIT to see what else she has in store for us bc i know its going to be amazing and its gonna hurt
