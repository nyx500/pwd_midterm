Despite me being annoyed by all the Harry Potter references (they were literally everywhere, please stop), this was a solid middle grade book.Nothing special and it felt a little rushed, but it's based on a good idea, it had a great writing style and characters with a lot of potential. I'm looking forward to continuing this series!
