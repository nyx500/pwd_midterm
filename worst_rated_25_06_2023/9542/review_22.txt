I have no idea what the heck happened in this book. Till the end I don't know how old the MC was, I have a general idea but I'm not sure I'm right. She acted like a teenager half the time and yet I think shes suppose to be in her 20's. The whole power thing I did not understand, it felt like there was a book missing, at least a book to explain all the half information we had been given and make it make sense. I will be reading the next book , hopefully that sheds some light on everything.
