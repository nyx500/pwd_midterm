98 pages in, I was wondering how I had convinced myself to read as far as I did. At least 3 times during the course of reading this, I checked to make sure that this was the first book in the series. Something just felt really incomplete about it, as if I were starting the story in the middle and didn't have all the information I needed for everything to make sense. If I were an editor, I would have required the author to have a prologue which shows us what happened to Kaylin 7 years ago and gives us a definition of the relationship between Kaylin and Severn. The first chapters are a total information overload without providing enough detail to really get to know the different races, social structure, or setting. When it came to picturing the characters in my mind, it was a total blank to me. Some kind of glossary/index would have been really useful when trying to figure out the definitions and identities of some of the characters. Lastly, I didn't agree with the punctuation placements of commas and semi-colons in this novel. Their placement really interrupted the flow of how someone would really say that statement, and I found it highly distracting. I hope she improves on this in later books, but I won't be reading to find out. This book was really frustrating to try to read, but as much as I love writing reviews, I don't always rely on the reviews of others when making a decision to read a book or pass on it. If I'd seen some of the reviews first, I probably would still have picked up the book. The one thing this series has going for it is the really amazing covers. This book is a great example of why you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
