One step above painful. The plot had great promise. I have no idea what the author was writing. It was unbelievably tangential, convoluted in the extreme, and confusing. The analogies were quite often meaningless. I read passages over and over. All I could do was shake my head and move on. Large portions of dialogue would take place in which you could not determine who was speaking. And it seemed at the end of the book most of the players had already really known what was going on the whole time, and for some strange reason simply went along with the whole quest of trying to figure it out, just for the hell of it. And everyone else was "getting it" in the end except the heroine, and thus the reader. The heroine would say "I don't understand", and the others would just look at each other and shake their heads at her inability to figure it out. It was maddening! Somebody explain it!Parts of the plot were divulged (I think), but it might as well have been rocket science for all I could make of it. I've rarely read a book in which so many nouns, adjectives, and verbs have come together without actually completing a sensical thought. In truth, having read the entire book, I still don't completely understand what happened. I only have a vague understanding of it, much, I think, like the heroine.
