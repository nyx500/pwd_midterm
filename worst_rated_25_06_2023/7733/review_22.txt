"This is a giant rip off of Honey I Shrunk the Kids and Honey I Blew up the Kid." This is a line from Paul Bryant's review,which made me smile.Gulliver's Travels works equally well as a biting satire on the human condition,as a children's story,a morality play,and for that matter as the source for some fun movie adaptations.First read in my childhood as an Urdu translation,later as a textbook and finally went through the whole thing by choice.The first two voyages to Liliput and Brobdingnag are a lot of fun. After that,the two remaining voyages to Laputa and the land of the yahoos,though laced with deep meaning are not as memorable.An interesting series of adventures,or rather misadventures.It entertains as well as vexes the reader.
