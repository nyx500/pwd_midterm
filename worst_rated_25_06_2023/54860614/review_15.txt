5/ 5⭐0/5 🌶️Ariadne by Jenifer Saint is a Greek mythology retelling from a women's perceptive has been a tragic read. This book has touched my heart and soul. Saint’s re-telling of the classic myth follows the stories of Minos’ daughters Ariadne and Phaedra, after the Minotaur is defeated. Absolutely beautiful, raw and shocking. I'm loving the Greek Mythology fiction books from the female perspective. The way she depicts complex relationships with family, lovers and children is as rich as the wine and grapes of Naxos that she so vividly describes. The pain of centuries of women, being fueled by the hand of men was epically penned in this retelling of infamous ancient Greek tragedy. This book was often painful to read, due to the ordeals each female suffered through and all they lost as their stories progressed. I adored every aspect of this story. P.S. I cried.Quotes: “I would not let a man who knew the value of nothing make me doubt the value of myself.” “I would not let a man who knew the value of nothing make me doubt the value of myself.” “No longer was my world one of brave heroes; I was learning all too swiftly the women's pain that throbbed unspoken through the tales of their feats.”“The price we paid for the resentment, the lust and the greed of arrogant men was our pain, shining and bright like the blade of a newly honed knife.”“The price we paid for the resentment, the lust and the greed of arrogant men was our pain, shining and bright like the blade of a newly honed knife.”
