Ariadne, Princess of Crete, daughter of King Minos, grows up listening to stories of gods, goddesses, and mortal heroes. She witnesses gods and men having the upper hand, and women being just a tool. She sees her motherâ€™s suffering from the hands of gods, and vows to have a different fate. But will she have the strength to forge a different path for herself? In a male dominated world, there are also strong female characters. And that voice is given to Ariadne and her sister Phaedra in this story.Ariadne is a captivating character, going through triumph and heartbreak. This gorgeous reimagining of the Greek mythology is very ambitious with some details that make the pace extremely slow. Due to complexity of Greek mythology, I personally prefer a simplified version over the very complex one.
