To her credit, her writing is beautiful and it does come across as Miller lite (no, not the beer), but the story lacks the soul and the heart that I expect from Madeline Miller's books. Her stories about Circe and Achilles both made me cry. This book just had me nodding along and going, "Well, that would be a nice quote for Pinterest." I've been reading this for the last two hours and keep getting bored, so I think I'll be calling it quits here.2 stars
