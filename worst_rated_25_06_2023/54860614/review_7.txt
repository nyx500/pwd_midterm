↠ 1 star Sometimes when Brittany tells you not to read something because it ended poorly you listen. Ariadne was on my list for most anticipated of 2021 and after hearing so many rave reviews, it’s safe to say I was looking forward to reading it. Greek mythology retellings have always had a special place in my heart, and as a baseline rule, I like to give them the benefit of the doubt prior to reading them. Ariadne drew me in with its beautiful descriptive language, and the promise of a long overlooked character’s story finally being unveiled. Everyone knows the story of the labyrinth, of the minotaur trapped inside, and a young girl foolish enough to betray its secrets for love. To put it plainly, there was so much potential from the get go, but the longer the story went on, the more it seemed like this was just a reread of the original myth from Ariadne’s perspective. Not much differed from my finite knowledge of the myth to which this was based on, and what was different was just watered down or changed entirely for the wrong reasons. I was hoping the ending would give me the satisfaction I was looking for, I mean you hear “feminist retelling” and you get a little excited. However, upon reaching the end I have to say that giving this novel that description could not be more misleading, and is quite literally the source of all my disappointment. If you came for a retelling about a woman claiming her power, in a story that never initially spared her a second glance, keep moving.Trigger warnings: blood, violence, murder, death, animal abuse, childbirth, rape (mentioned)
