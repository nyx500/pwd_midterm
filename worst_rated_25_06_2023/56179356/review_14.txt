I love a good fractured fairy tale and who would have thought anyone could write one this good based on boring Sleeping Beauty.A Spindle Splintered is a reimagining of the tale of the Sleeping Beauty, but in this case the Princess refuses to play her normal role and fights for better choices in her life. She is aided by Zinnia, a twenty year old girl living in modern day America who is dying from a rare disease. She imagines herself to be like Sleeping Beauty about to go to sleep forever and when she pricks her finger she sets amazing events in action.Zinnia, her friend Charm, and a number of other Princesses come together across multiple dimensions and many literary versions. (Best not to try and understand the technicalities, just go with the flow and enjoy the fun.) It is lots of fun too - Harrow has a cunning sense of humour.I enjoyed it all enormously and am looking forward to the second book to see what happens to these delightful characters.
