"Even among other nerds who majored in folklore, Sleeping Beauty is nobody's favorite. Romantic girls like Beauty and the Beast; vanilla girls like Cinderella; goth girls like Snow White. Only dying girls like Sleeping Beauty."It's Zinnia Gray's 21st birthday, and given that she suffers from a rare medical condition with a life expectancy of under 22 years, it's likely the last she will ever have. During her childhood she had an obsession with Sleeping Beauty, a story she related to knowing that she too had a deadline before her endless sleep. On this birthday, she does the natural thing, drinks too much and enjoys a night with her only friend in an abandoned tower. Her friend knowing her so well sets up a Sleeping Beauty theme for her last party but when she pricks her finger, she doesn't fall asleep. She finds herself in a fairy tale universe, and she needs to figure out the rules of and how Grimm it will be.So, I'm going to make a slight confession here. I love stories that put twisted spins on fairy tales. I studied them for quite some time for a paper I wrote, and I love seeing modern authors put their own spins on these timeless tales, as such this book really worked for me.It's a fun little book. The lead makes quite a few pop-culture which may be off putting to some readers, but I personally enjoyed (calling it fairy tale Spider-Verse is one of the best nods I've read in some time). I loved that the book was clearly researched as it makes nods to many of the variations of the fairy tale.The book is short (only 119 pages) so it won't take up too much of your time. That said, I enjoyed every page of it. Well worth a read. 4/5 stars
