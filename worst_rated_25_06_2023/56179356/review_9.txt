"A Spindle Splintered" by Alix E. Harrow is the first book in the 'Fractured Fables' novella series.Zinnia Gray is turning 21 years old and knows this is most likely the last birthday she'll ever celebrate. She has a rare condition not much is known about other than no one has lived to age twenty-two. Charm, her BFF, is determined to make a birthday celebration worthy of Zinnia's dreams. She's shooting for the complete Sleeping Beauty experience with a huge tower and spinning wheel. But when Zinnia pricks her finger, she finds herself in an alternate world! Zinnia is face-to-face with a fairy-tale princess and begins a mission to do all she can to save Primrose from a fate worse than death... A creative retelling of Sleeping Beauty with strong female overtones and modern day damsel-in-distress twists! This story is fun, rip-quick, and packed with dark humor, colorful language, feminism, the power of sisterhood, and lesbian characters! Oh, and cell phone communication, too! I listened to the 3+ hour audiobook narrated by Amy Landon who does an amazing job of bringing Zinnia to life. Her voicing skills are first rate and she pulls off all the dark humor and colorful language in such a perfectly unique way. It was quite brilliant, really!I can't wait to read the next book in this series A Mirror Mended.
