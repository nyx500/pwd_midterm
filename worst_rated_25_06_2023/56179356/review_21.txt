I don’t think it’s an overstatement at this point to say that I’d lie down in traffic for Alix Harrow. She is such an unbelievable writer and storyteller that she’s joined my shortlist of “buy their books the moment they are rumored to exist” authors.I can’t say that Sleeping Beauty was one of my favorite fairy tales as a child (mostly because I could only nail one out of the two titular elements), but when Harrow applies her trademark mix of incandescent prose, Vitamix-like wit (it slices, dices, AND purees), metatextual analysis, and social commentary to it, the familiar tale becomes something new, exciting, and revelatory.
