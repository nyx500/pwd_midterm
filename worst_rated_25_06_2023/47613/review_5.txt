4.5 Silver Starswith Golden SparksRTC after re-readin the gap between waiting for Pendragon & the secrets of Nicholas Flamel I found this series, intriguing & cool; sometimes a bit confusing in plot or scene, with an interesting world building.I liked it, I liked the characters, as always, Arthur was my favourite.
