Okay, so I was all set to love this book. Like REALLY LOVE IT. I picked it up a few weeks ago but had to return it to the library, but because I was so SET TO LOVE IT etc., I went out and bought my own copy to take to New Zealand.:|I just didn't believe a bit of it. I thought the dialogue was rubbish. Arthur came across really nothingy to me. I loved the actual concepts, but it felt badly executed. I'm bothered, because it could've been so fantastic, and I heard an interview with Garth Nix the other day and he sounded so wonderfully lovely and just my sort of bloke, but ARGH. Maybe I just don't get it! I feel like I have to justify myself with this, because it seems so universally loved. But then, I'm not a Sabriel et al fan either, so. Anyway, none of that really matters because I managed to lose the book somewhere between Te Anau and Dunedin. Perhaps it was my subconscious at work, SAVING ME FROM FINISHING IT. I hope so.
