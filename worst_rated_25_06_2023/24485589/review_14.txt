Intricate, rich and enchanting,  Hunted  was the tale I never knew I needed - it's a Beauty and the Beast winter retelling interspersed with Russian elements, captivating folklore, and an overall ethereal, snowy atmosphere that contributed to the whimsical fairytale setting in the book. Yeva's heart spoke to mine on a personal level. The restlessness, the constant wanting, the inability to settle, the soul-deep longing. It's the first time in a long time that I've found a heroine after my own wild heart, and I love this book for it.
