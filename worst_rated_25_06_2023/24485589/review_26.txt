(I received an advance copy of this book for free. Thanks to HarperCollins and Edelweiss.)"This is a dream," she whispered. "Magic. A fairy tale."This was a YA retelling of Beauty and the Beast.I liked Yeva, and I liked how strong she was in difficult situations. She went after her father when he was in trouble, and she didn't give up on the Beast either, even when everybody else had. She was quite stubborn though, she didn't always take the easy option, and was opinionated as to what she wanted to do with the rest of her life. The storyline in this was about Yeva's father losing his fortune, and then going missing in the woods, and Yeva trying to follow him, and ending up a captive of the Beast. We also got another interesting tale about a firebird woven into the story, and I really liked Yeva's love interest before the Beast - Solmir, who seemed sweet and willing to bend to her desires. "I am not asking you to love me," he said, his voice ringing in the quiet winter air. "Only that you let me love you. As I do."The romance between Yeva and the Beast was very slow, and it did take Yeva quite a long time to realise her feelings for the Beast, and then even longer still to work out what to do about them. I personally didn't find there to be as much romance as I expected though, and it seemed like more of a case of Yeva wanting to rescue him than falling in love with him. The story was enjoyable though, even if the pace was maybe a little slow.The ending to this was a happily ever after, and i liked how things turned out, especially because it wasn't just Beauty and the Beast who got a happy ending.6.5 out of 10
