**3.5-stars rounded up**What the heck did I just read?This novella is so unique. There's an overriding feeling that comes from reading it that I cannot describe.When I first finished The Deep, I was blown away, but also didn't really fully understand it. Newsflash, I still don't.As far as content, I didn't retain much; just the feeling. It's too bad because it is such a different reading experience and I believe, from what I understand, the creation of this novella was quite unique as well.Whilst reading, I was overwhelmed with feelings that I was being told some wise and ancient lore; something dug up from the deepest depths of a rich oral history.The audiobook is a beautiful experience, even though I won't pretend to understand it all.I do appreciate the creation of this story and I would even read it again, it's just a hard one to grasp. Absolutely moving though, even if you don't fully understand why it is slowly ripping your heart out of your chest.In short, I would need to read this again before I can provide more thoughts. Something I would most definitely be willing to do. Thank you so much to the publisher, Saga Press, for sending me a copy to read and review. I truly appreciate the opportunity!
