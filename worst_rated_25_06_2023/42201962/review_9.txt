update: dec 3, 2019I'm really sad about it, but I'm setting this aside at the 40% mark. It's such an incredible premise, but I'm not enjoying the actual writing much at all and I'm hoping it's just the mood that I'm in. I'll give it another try later and hopefully it'll work better for me.———I love mer-people, I love clipping., and I love every single speck of the premise for this. I need this SO BAD(Also, if you haven't already, check out the song that inspired Rivers Solomon to write this)
