/2.5 stars/This has been another round of Joey dashing into a book too fast and missing the ‘lgbt’ label. 🤦���♂️But yeah. That’s always fuuuun.I didn’t hate it. I promise, I really didn’t. I’m not gonna do a typical review here, I’m just gonna share some thoughts and then do content.1) There is no freaking way I’m trying to spell the names cuz i listened to the audio.2) There were weird undertones of like... evolution/new age/ humanism, which was just weird.3) I loved the writing. ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.4) did the mermaids (ik Ik but like i said I’m not trying to spell the actual name rn) have to be able to determine their own gender? Cause I’m sorry, but that’s not how it works.5) the remembering were basically meditation? Huh. Weird.6) the characters were a bit non relatable but the writing was gorgeous as I said so it made up for that 😂CONTENT:Language: basically no language. There was one outburst where someone used God’s name in vain three times in a row.Sexual:Yetu (pls tell me that’s right) falls in love with a female human. Yetu is a girl. I guess. It’s hard to explain and overly weird but I guess it didn’t bother me a ton just bc it was kinda like Yetu could be either gender i guess? Which was still bad but Idek at this point.One VERY awkward dialogue about sexual reproduction between Yetu and Ari(?).Anways, HAPPY READING!
