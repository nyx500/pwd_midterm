Um . . . . I can't even begin to explain the stuff in this book. You will have to read it or read some other review. But, I freaking loved it! How? I don't know, I'm weird that way. Note: There is a glossary in the back to help with the book. I should probably have studied it but it's all good! Paige gets taken by these people things and is turned into a slave. She gets the better person thing as her master. His name is Arcturus but he's called Warden. I liked him. Yeah, he was a slave owner but he was something else too. Things are not always what they seem. You know, I say that a lot in books. This must be happening in a lot of books I read. It's also because I don't want to let slip a spoiler! Anyhoo, these people that are being captured to be slaves have powers. They are dreamwalkers and all kinds of things. I can't even explain how many there are and what all the different powers are that they have. They can kill you with their minds or something. I was just along for the ride! Oh, and there are these things that will eat you if you go into the forest or sometimes they come into the towns or whatever at night and a siren goes off to warn you to get inside. It's crazy peeps. I forgot what they are called but they are like some nasty skinned person thingamabob! I'm going to read the other books in the trilogy so I can get more confused and have lots of fun doing it =D
