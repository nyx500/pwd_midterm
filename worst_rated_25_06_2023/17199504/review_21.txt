Edit: So, it's only been a few days - I think just two days actually - and I can't stop thinking about this book. The characters. The world. So good. So damn good! I. LOVED. THIS. BOOK. I went into this with no expectations at all and not knowing what it would be about, and I think that's definitely the best approach, and holy hell, I loved every minute of it! Books that I find difficult to put down or give me heart palpitations are always, of course, great and memorable reads for me. Here's the thing: the ideas itself weren't necessarily unique. These tropes have been utilised before. But the execution is what made it original and engrossing for me. I absolutely loved the world-building. It was my favourite part! I can see how at the beginning it may be confusing or considered 'info-dumping', but I personally didn't find that to be the case. Yes, I felt slightly lost at times, but as I read on, I was immediately pulled back in, things were clarified and the world started making more sense and the pieces came together beautifully. And in no way did it hinder my reading experience. Usually, with fantasy/dystopian novels, the world and the terminology can get a bit overwhelming, but the balance was perfect. The pacing was excellent as were the development of the characters. Shannon did an incredible job with all of those aspects for me. I've no idea how the rest of the series is going to play out. Part of me is excited that it'll be a seven-book series, because I've no idea what to expect or what we're are in for and that alone is enough to make me giddy, but I'm also afraid that there might be lulls in the middle. Either way, this was a fantastic debut (at such as young age as well!!!) and is definitely a series I'm going to stick to.
