this was recommended to me after i finished reading the grishaverse books (as something similar), and honestly, i cant really agree with that comparison. but that doesnt mean this isnt entertaining in its own right. i was a little overwhelmed at first - there is SO much world building, and so quickly, that it kind of feels like i was being thrown into the deep end with really no idea about what was going on. but eventually the story became easier to get into. the world is just so fascinating that i really had no choice. lol. overall, this is a pretty strong debut and solid first book to a series i hope to continue. â†  3.5 stars
