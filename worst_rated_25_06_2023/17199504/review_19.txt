This was a great book and I really, really enjoyed reading it. The world Samantha Shannon has created is a very interesting one and I loved how it was a little more complex than your usual YA fantasy world. Once I'd gotten into the book, it was a very gripping and quick read and I quickly became fond of most of the main characters. So overall, this was a really enjoyable read but especially towards the end of the novel, many parts felt like they were just a mixture of popular other YA books like Divergent and The Hunger Games which annoyed me a little. Not because it stopped me from further enjoying the book, but because I had genuinely hoped this would be my first proper 5-star read of 2018.So if it hadn't been for these similarities to other YA books in the end, I would've definitely given this book five stars. Now I'm giving it four stars and I'm excited for the next book in the series!
