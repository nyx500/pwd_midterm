5 STARSI HATE finishing a book that I absolutely adored reading - it makes me walk around in a depressed state as I come to realization that I might not hear from the characters again, that I might not find such a wonderful book again ... This is how I feel right now: Torn. Thrilled. Depressed. Jovial.Putting aside my momentary depression, I read  Crimson Bound  first and loved Hodge's world building and writing - so naturally, I picked this book up and was not disappointed. If anything, I loved this book more than the other.From the first chapter, I loved Nyx. She is probably one of my favorite characters now. Her fearless attitude, snarky comments, and random moments of punching someone in the face had me laughing nearly every chapter. Not only that, but she had very real thoughts of hatred and annoyance towards her family that were refreshing to read (they were not nice people). Overall, she was just a believable character since not everyone is so "pure-hearted" in life, and I'm getting really tired of all the goody-goody main characters I come across  all the freaking time.  I really enjoyed reading from a dark POV. It was intense, to say the least.Okay okay, lastly, let me just add that the first scene with Nyx and the Gentle Lord made me burst out laughing, and I don't mean that fake laughter where someone says they're laughing and they're not. I mean I was actually laughing and crying at 3 in the morning - holding this book to my chest because I knew I was going to freaking love it.Wow ... I had to pause for a few moments since I can't write a proper review right now. I'm so upset to have finished this book - but so thrilled to have read it. THIS WAS AMAZING, OKAY.Um. So, I'll probably come back and fix this review later because it sucks - but just because my review sucks doesn't mean you shouldn't read it! OKAY? Trust me and get this book!
