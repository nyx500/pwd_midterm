2 StarsMini-review since it's been like a month since I read this whoops.Pros- engrossing writing style- Audiobook narrator with the voice of a goddess- A fun combination of Greek mythology and Beauty and the Beast retelling- Main character who's allowed flaws and to be complex Cons: - In the quest to make the MC complex they made her indecisive and fickle. (she seriously couldn't make up her mind about anything for more than two pages)- None of the characters have a real conversation ever. They talk about love and connections on the first "date"- The ending makes no sense- Pointless love triangle was pointless- There's literally like a magical god bird who explains everything, but then MC conveniently forgets so that the story can drag on for a few more chapters In Conclusion:The definition of wasted potential. The first like three chapters are excellent and then it steadily declines
