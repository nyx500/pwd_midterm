This book really surprised me. When I was first reading this book I was not really digging it, I thought I had a handle on where the story was going, and therefore I thought it was too predictable. However, this story did not follow the stereotypical path that I thought it would. I still guessed the ending halfway in, but I enjoyed the ride nonetheless. The amount of predictability that may or may not be present in this book is not the important part, no, the important part is the story. The story is what really kept me so interested, it was beautiful and unique, and the delivery could not be ignored. The world combined well known ancient lore with (made up?) reinterpretations that added a wonderful level of fantasy. It was whimsical, and I really fell in love with the characters. I enjoyed throughly that they recognized their flaws and accepted them. The last 30 pages or so is what made me write this whole review because I LOVED the ending. So much. This book delivered something I did not expect, so for that I tip my hat to it. Also, it's a standalone. Score.
