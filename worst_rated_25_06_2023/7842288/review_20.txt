I HAVE NOW OFFICIALLY FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS SERIES!!!This book started of pretty slow but once the plot started I was hooked. The world of the Casters and their history and everything gets even more complicated and interesting and l loved it. We are introduced to new characters who are very fascinating( some good, some BAD). And I just have say this, the poems just keep coming don't they(not that I mind them- i like them).Ethan is, honestly, an amazing person. He doesn't give up, is brave, and i know he will do what it takes to protect those he cares about. This book gets a 4 from me, and I look forward to the next one.
