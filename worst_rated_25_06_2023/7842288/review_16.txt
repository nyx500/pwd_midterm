Oh. My. God. This was even better than the first one! I know that Lena was a major bitch and whiny like hell but it was so moving that I couldn't stop reading it. Even if I needed 5 days to finish it. Real world got in the way -.-Guess what? We have a love triangle! Surprise, surprise. I don't count John Breed as a part of any love interest (he's mine!!!!) so let's say that triangle consist of Lena, Ethan and someone else. You'll have to read the book to find out. Yes, I'm that evil. Though, in the end, it didn't feel like there was some sort of a love triangle at all.New characters, new characters! Dead ones coming to life again. Old ones losing their powers and gaining some new ones. Surprising secrets. Action waiting behind every corner. People, you gotta read this!!!Like with every main female character in sequels, Lena was a whiny one. Seriously, all that whining about her being different and not accepted and undecided is so exhausting. Give me a break, would ya?! I have a feeling it's going to become even worse because "oh, god, I've changed everything! What am I supposed to do?!?!"....Beside Lena, everything else was great. There were so many secrets discovered in this that I don't know how I was able to take it all in. That's what made this book so interesting. But I still think that authors saved a lot more for next books.Can Ridley and Link get together already? Guess not. Going to impatiently wait for my wallet to magically fill itself up so I can buy the next one in the series...
