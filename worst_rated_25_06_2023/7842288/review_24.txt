Loved this!Beautiful Darkness is like drinking a cup of hot cocoa. It's rich, smooth and made to be drunk read slowly to savor ever delicious word.Struggling with the loss of her Uncle's death, Lena is very different from the first book. In a nut shell? She's lost. Very.Very Lost.I have to admit, I was pretty frustrated with her character through out most of this book, but her journey was necessary to find her true path.Ethan totally owned this one. His love, his strength and his courage was something to be proud of. I loved the new twists concerning his role. Brilliant!This series is one of my all time favorites. It's filled with wonderful Southern charm. Thick surrounding's. Magical and mysterious characters and a concept so rich you could taste it.Lots of surprises happen. New characters and a bunch of new twists to get your mind spinning. I was completely intrigued and loved every second of this Amazing world.More Please!
