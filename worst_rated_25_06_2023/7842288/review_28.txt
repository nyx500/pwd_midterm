It has taken me almost eight years to finish this book. I tried to read this three times, the last time on audiobook. I only persevered because I had won this as a giveaway on Goodreads and the book is signed by both authors. I liked the first one. In fact, I thought it was fun with a fresh perspective of reading a YA book from a male pov.This one I absolutely deplored. I hated how the only plot and conflict revolved around some overly dramatic love triangle for our leads and some very out of character moments. I thought their behaviors were ridiculous. I absolutely despised how Lena constantly gaslighted Ethan on his feelings and the state of their relationship. He expressed his concerns and worries multiple times and the only responses Lena would give him was that he didn't understand because he was a mortal and not magical like she was. Or whenever he would mention John and how she seemed to be very familiar with him and she would only say it's not what it looks like.NO.That's not how a healthy couple should communicate. All she's doing is undermining his concerns and that somehow he's the one at fault for feeling this way. You know, Lena could have just expressed that she was feeling scared, anxious, guilty, or even just confided a bit about what was going on with her - otherwise why do you call yourselves partners, friends, in the first place? You don't build connections with people if you keep them at a distance - it could have promoted an active conversation and alleviated some of his misgivings. But no. The majority of these scenes mostly felt like filler and made the pacing far too slow for my liking.I'm sorry but this was not a good book.
