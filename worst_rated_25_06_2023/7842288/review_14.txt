If the whole book had been like the last 80 pages, it might have received a higher rating from me. Unfortunately, I just didn't enjoy the fact that the two main characters were pretty much separated for most of the story.Having to accompany Ethan on his journey to "save" Lena was a long, drawn out process. The group was searching, then back home, searching, then back home. I started skimming after a while.The highlight of Beautiful Darkness was the complicated relationship between Ridley and Link. I am interested to see what happens between these two, especially after the ending left me questioning Ridley's motives yet again.
