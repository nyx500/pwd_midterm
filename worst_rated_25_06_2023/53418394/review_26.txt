This is a dark, richly imagined world where the Big Bad Wolf isn’t exactly what you were always told. It’s a world where the First Daughter is for the Throne, the Second Daughter is for the Wolf, and the Wolf is for the Wilderwood. Twin sisters Red and Neve are devastated that soon Red will be sent to the Wilderwood forest as a sacrifice to the Wolf. Legend has it that the Wolf demanded that payment in exchange for keeping the monsters of the forest at bay. The people also want the Five Kings back, and they hope that this human sacrifice will appease the Wolf enough to free them. When Red arrives at the forest she discovers that her knowledge of the Wilderwood and the Wolf are mostly tall tales and soon she will have to harness her mysterious and budding powers to save her world. This novel has the classic dark and brooding male love interest, the heroine who doesn’t need any man to save her, and a few evil villains added to the mix. It is a slowly paced tale with rich detail that never feels like information overload. I prefer fantasy with well-developed characters over heavy plot and world-building. This book struck a nice balance between fully imagined characters and a forest that literally comes alive. I took one star off because, sometimes, I found the plot dragged. The romance wasn’t for me, but I’m sure others will enjoy it. Still, I can’t wait for the sequel!Thank you to Netgalley and Orbit for this ARC in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinions.
