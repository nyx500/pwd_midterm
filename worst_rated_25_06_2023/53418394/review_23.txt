Full review to come on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/hollyheartsbooksFinding light in the darkness is something we can all relate to -- whether it be as simple as discovering the solution to a small puzzle or as grand a notion as searching for oneâ€™s purpose in life. For The Wolf addresses both ends of this spectrum and does so throughout with charm, smarts, and grace. This Red Riding Hood inspired fantasy had me more invested in the sentient forest and the creatures calling it home than the romance smothered in its pages.
