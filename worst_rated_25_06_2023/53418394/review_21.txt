My reaction to this book on my second re-read has been much different, I've enjoyed it much more for reasons I expand on in my review for "For the Throne," and because of this experience, I would encourage readers to give this a chance. Also, if you only have the first book, don't start it if you don't have the second at hand. It's worth reading both together.In hindsight, I think this first book suffered a lot from media hype. It's more like Novik than Arden in broad strokes, but Whitten's style is very different to both authors and the hype created expectations unfair for a d√©but author amongst the readership. She tends to be more plot-driven here than character-driven as in the second book, and isn't as expansive and clear in the worldbuilding or explanations for the magic as the other authors are. Whitten likes to keep her cards close, and reveal things at certain points, and this tendency to secretiveness makes it confusing to readers.Also worth nothing that the romantic pairing in this book doesn't have the chemistry and banter exchanges that so many readers, me included, love in our stories. That might've affected many readers' enjoyment negatively. Red isn't exactly all that likable sometimes, and she makes stupid mistakes, as does her sister. These issues improve in the second book, though, and more of the world is explained.Overall, I think it's a pretty good book and Whitten is surprisingly good at storytelling for a newcomer writer. But "For the Wolf" is only half of a story and ends a bit abruptly, so this is also going to factor in when rating this book, and why you should pick up the second book immediately after.
