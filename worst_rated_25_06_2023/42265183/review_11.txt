The October Fairyloot Unboxing! I hope I love this book!! Click on the GOODIES LINK below to see the goodies. THE GOODIES LINK OMGWELL SON OF A DAMN BISCUIT EATER!! I didn’t like it at all 😕. Okay, I’m gonna have to drop all my book boxes if they don’t give me more books to love because it’s a waste of money. Thank goodness the goodies were freaking amaze balls!  I was worried when I saw it was this author as I didn’t like one of her other books. She’s just not for me but I’m glad other people like her work! 😉Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
