if theres one city that promises the haunting presence of the paranormal, its new orleans. and i, for one, am so happy the crescent city is finally being showcased in all is vampire glory.i was actually very worried to read this. its one of my most anticipated releases of 2019 and the reviews that have been popping up have been a little less than positive. but either i read a different ARC or i am just a simple girl who doesnt need much to be entertained, because i found this to be quite splendid.renee ahdieh is the queen of duologies so, while i admit that other readers are right when they say the pacing is super slow, i know a great foundation is built and the plot will be much faster paced in the next book. i will also concede that there isnt much focus on vampires. there is a great deal of mystery and secrecy surrounding the city and its society. while the reader can infer what many of the characters are, its never confirmed until the very end. based on the conclusion, the focus will definitely shift in the next book, with it being very vampire heavy. like i said, this felt like a foundation building beginning, which i didnt mind in the slightest. i feel so bad that this disappointed so many, but i thought it felt like a classic ahdieh story. so obviously, i loved it!â†  4.5 stars
