Who wants to get on their medieval banking drama, yo?A high quality, modern, straightforward fantasy from a reliable author with established bonafides. It reminded me a lot of Joe Abercrombie's First Law books in its approach to characters and plot progression, but despite a comparable quantity of deaths overall, it lacks the nihilism needed to classify it as grimdark. I liked most of the characters with the exception of Dawson, the rigid nobleman maneuvering to make his vision for the kingship reality. He lacked character development in this story. Young orphan Cithrin functions well as the vulnerable underdog, and the once-venerated Captain Marcus's pervading grief is palpable. Geder, a minor noble and the eternal butt of others' jokes, gains sympathy early when his rare book is destroyed by a tormentor, drawing the ire of real-life readers everywhere. The two main storylines in this book have only minor linkages but the worldbuilding sets the scene for a grand series plot that will leave none untouched. The world of the book is populated by a species split into more than a dozen disparate races, one of them aquatic, all bestial in appearance including the human analogue Firstbloods, and mostly cross-breedable. The dragons of the title are ancient history.I have nothing bad to say about this book. It's quality through and through. I will read the remainder of the series. I have to laugh at myself because not long ago I expressly wondered, "Why isn't Daniel Abraham publishing more?," considering this series and his prior Long Price Quartet. I was blissfully ignorant of his multiple pseudonyms at the time.
