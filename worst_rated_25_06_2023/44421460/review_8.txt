The writing and the characters are really annoying.Because it is the umpteenth time I picked it up and yet, it's time to accept the fact that this book is just not for me. I just couldn't be patient with what the story was coming to with all that repetitive lines and the writing in the first half. The characters seem rather dull. I did try to finish up the book but I started having a headache because I was doing something I didn't want to and had to close the book and delete it after taking the picture.Yes, I love Japanese books. I love weird stories. I like emotional, sad stories. This one is all these things but it just didn't work for me. I really wanted to like this one but it's fine. Just like what happened with A Man Called Ove (my heart's still broken!), this one has a similar history in my reading life. I wish it was a short story instead. A short book which seemed too long amd repetitive for me (like how it happened with Autumn by Ali Smith). Sad story indeed.
