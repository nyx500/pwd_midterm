This was pretty lovely.At times, it was very lovely. My very favorite things are lovely things, and simple, wonderful magical realism is my favorite hard-to-find-done-well genre, and for a while it seemed like this could qualify as being both of those things.But then...a severe damper arrives. My parade is rained on. Stormy weather comin' in. Insert other precipitation metaphors.Unfortunately, I have to tuck away the thing that threatened to ruin it all in little ol' spoiler tags: I hate (HATE!!!!) or "personally do not like books" where women die because of a pregnancy. Let alone for a pregnancy. Especially on purpose. Especially in books written by men. Itâ€™s just not my cup of tea.Or should I say coffee???(Buh dum ch.)Bottom line: This was almost very good, and then it wasn't, for me. But it was still good.-------currently-reading updatesdon't mind me, just adding more and more books to my currently reading because all of my library loans are coming in at once and making me into a juggler except with books. so an even dorkier juggler.
