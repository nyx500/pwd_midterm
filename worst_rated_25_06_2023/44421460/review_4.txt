Summary  This is a beautifully written novel happening inside a retro cafe where time travel is possible. It has four different stories interwoven together with characters who have their individual existence yet perfectly complement each other. What I learned from this book 1) The effect of Alzheimer’s disease in marital and family life In Alzheimer’s disease, the subtle and sporadic deterioration of patients brain function will be a very arduous phase in their partners, and their family members life, and it is one of the rare situations in Medical Science where the spouse and family members suffer more than the patient (The author depicted it perfectly through the characters Fusagi and Kohtake.)   2) Hope for a better future is the secret behind our current happy existence When Kei said she wanted to go to the future to see whether she would have her child due to all the pregnancy-related complications she was having at that time, her husband Nagare argued strongly against her decision as he thought that if she went into the future and discovered that the child didn’t exist, the hope which is the inner strength that had been sustaining his wife until then would be destroyed. The author shows us that hope is one of the most important things in our life via these two characters.3) How we should behave if someone close to us passes awayThe author beautifully told us how to face the death of our loved ones in this book by convincing us to stay happy and always keep on smiling so that the person who died can see us happy from the dark box (The author compares death to a dark box in this novel) to make him/her also happy.My favourite three lines from this book or related to this book “At the end of the day, whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present doesn't change.” “Negativity is food for malady, one might say.”  “Coffee on a sail boat tastes like sunrise ” Verdict  4/5This is a book written in simple language that makes you fall in love with it from the first page itself due to its veracity and edifies us to relish the beauty of our life through love and hope.
