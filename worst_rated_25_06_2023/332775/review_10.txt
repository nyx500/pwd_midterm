I'm finished. Done. Turned the last page.And I'm so glad.What a royal waste of time it would have been better spent sleeping cos yup this book was as boring as watching paint dry lol. For a long time I've been excited about the premise of this book and ordered it from my library being very excited to read it. While it did start off promising with the promise of shocking revelations to come, the book soon went down and by the end it fell flat on its face. Okay the characters. Finn had so much potential in him to become an epic hero but the way the author described him made him as bland as porridge with no sweet additive. I also felt that we didn't see enough of him, that his asshole "oathbrother" Kiero stole nearly all the light plus the revelation about him hardly registered at all as his character was so dull. The other main character Claudia. While she was still a cardboard cutout like everyone else, it did feel like she had a little more spark to her. But her story and situations were so boring I could see many ways in which they ould have been made more exciting.All the revelations when they came, while I wasn't expecting them, they were delivered in an unremarkable way Incarceron is actually the size of a small cube key charm the warden caarries around and all thats inside it and all its inhabitants are shrunk to about the size of atoms a whole landscape world in a tiny cube.. So for me, I felt that hardly anything happened in this book and I had long since lost interest in it and perhaps people who like really slow going mysteries would like this? But is was a huge letdown for me.
