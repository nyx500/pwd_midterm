Wow this book is one hell of a ride. Non stop intensity, suspense, and action. Frankly, not only is it a great book it would be an awesome movie. This craziness made for a great twisted plot but did leave a bit to be desired when it came to characterization. This book is about a melding of 2 worlds. Finn from the prison Incarceron, and Claudia from 'Outside' who also happens to be the daughter of the Warden of Incarceron come into contact through a communication device in the shape of a crystal key. Each are running from something - Finn from the horrors of the prison and Claudia from the horrors of an arranged marriage. This merging of their two worlds revolved around royal assassinations, political intrigues, and historical cover ups. It was all really fascinating and I a pretty unique resolution to their society's issues. The 2 main characters were OK I guess but not my favorites. Finn was overly whiny considering how long he had lived in the prison but he had good morals. Claudia was supposed to have 2 sides to her, her fake side whenever her father is present which is stuffy, snobby, and proper. Her other side when he is gone is supposed to be more carefree, sweet, and good natured, but this was proven not true when she left for her wedding and most of the staff was basically happy to see her and her snobbiness go. The secondary characters provided a lot more insight into the story that Finn and Claudia - namely Kiero, Jared, and the Warden. They each showed a different side to society and the effects of upbringing and environment. I spent more of the book agonizing over whether or not both Kiero and the Warden were really bad or not! All in all a fantastic book that I highly recommend. I totally can't wait for the sequel Sapphique to come out in December!
