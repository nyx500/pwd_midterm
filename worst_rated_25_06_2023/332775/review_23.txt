I thoroughly enjoyed reading this, but I have always been into reading fairytales and although they don't live happily ever after, this book reads like a fairytale. It's a very imaginative, original and engrossing story that is vividly written with great characters. It has action and suspense, but no romance (thank God, no love-triangle!).I loved every second of it and although I didn't want to rush through it and enjoy it to the fullest, I couldn't put it down until I reached the last page. It's all about Finn, Claudia and of course Incarceron.Finn is a prisoner with no memory, sure he came from Outside though the prison has been sealed for centuries and only one man has ever escaped. More than anything he wants to know who he is and where he came from, but can he ever be sure? He hates it that he has no choice, but to leave his friends behind on the Inside.Claudia, the daughter of the Warden of Incarceron, lives Outside like a prisoner in a manor house, in a society where time is forbidden and doomed to an arranged marriage. She unravels the mystery around the death of a Prince, she thinks she knows the truth and she thinks that she knows who she is, but does she really?Finn and Claudia both want to escape, they both hold a key and they both want to KNOW. They meet, bond and are united in their fight for freedom and truth.Incarceron is alive, sees and hears everything and is, like Finn and Claudia, also looking for a way out.Can't wait to read the sequel: "Sapphique".
