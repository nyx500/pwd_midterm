So, a couple of my friends have RAVED about this book, so I thought I'd give it a try. First couple of pages, "La La La, this seems all right, don't know what the fuss is a- WHAT THE?!" This was a wild and crazy book. Tense. Intricate. Claustrophobic. (So very, VERY claustrophobic.) Basically, in a future where even the moon shows the scars from many wars, peace has been made by taking all the unsavory elements and putting them into a giant, sentient prison. On the outside, people live in a semblance of Ye Olden Tymes, when things were simpler and less warlike. But Incarceron, the prison, was supposed to be a paradise to keep the inmates pacified. Unfortunately, Incarceron decided it was bored with that . . .I mean, really crazy stuff. Stuff that made my brain hurt. And then at the end, stuff that made me scream, "You mean I have to wait until DECEMBER for book two?!"
