This was a little cringy and cliched sometimes but I actually had a really great time with it. I enjoyed the concept a lot, it was a good contemporary with a fantasy twist. The writing style was quick and easy and the characters were also pretty interesting. Sure, especially the side characters could've been more developed but they weren't totally depthless either.I'm looking forward to reading more of Ness' books.
