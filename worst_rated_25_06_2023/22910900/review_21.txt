I really enjoy the author's writing style and his book A Monster Calls will go down as one of my lifetime favorites. I hadn't read any other of his books and grabbed this at a local bookstore to give it a shot. The story flows and takes some odd twists and turns. I wasn't sure what to expect and don't typically read YA so went into it with an open mind. My favorite character is Jared because he thinks of others first. The main character was frustrating at times with his self involved thinking...as teenagers can often be. I would have liked to had more story built around the indie kids and what battle they were fighting, as at times it got a little murky. However the story was entertaining and very easy to read. I felt the author was fair about mental illness and didn't turn it into a trope.
