If Twilight, Evernight, Fallen, and every ironical, satirical self-indulgent parody slash crack!fick ever published on ao3 went to a rave party, had a proficient foursomes that magically turned into them having a miraculous baby and said baby was constantly high on crack, it'd be this book. I honestly can't tell if this book is for real or if I hallucinated the whole thing _I impulse-bought the sequel of this book because it was 70% off and because the cover rudely screamed TWILIGHT in my freaking face (and we all know twilight is my favorite guilty/cringey pleasure book) till I picked it up so I felt obligated to read it 🤷🏼‍♀️But ngl I can't take this book seriously.
