I cheerfully ignored that voice, downloading books 1-3 in this series from Kindle Unlimited just in case it turned out to be the most amazing thing since sliced bread. I liked TWILIGHT, okay, and I love vampires, and sometimes, a thirty-year-old bitch is in a ~mood~ for vampire trash because thirty-year-old bitches have aesthetics, too.But this was a mistake. And now I have a headache shaped exactly like this book, which is basically what would happen if you let someone write John Green/Smeyer crossover fic and that person also had a Wattpad account. The only thing more painful than the bad romance was its attempts to break the fourth wall.1 star
