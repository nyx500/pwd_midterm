This was.... rough... 😬 The first half of this book was just a bunch of Twilight-esc angst- but more extreme. I say that as someone who admittedly liked Twilight. 🤦🏼‍♀️ But this was over the top with the “stay away” “but I love you” drama. It was super annoying that it took the main character over half the angsty puppy dog looks full of book to find out her crush was a vampire. 🙄 From that point forward, it was.... ummm... okay? It’s clearly written for our current YA crowd, as the terms “FML” and “AF” were used several times. It boggles me when authors choose to use trending teen slang- as it limits the audience and eventually will make the book sound very dated. And.... now I sound old... get off my lawn!! 😂🤣❤️📚
