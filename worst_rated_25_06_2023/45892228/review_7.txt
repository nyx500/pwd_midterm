Did this book feel like a Twilight rip off?Absolutely.Did I have a fun time reading it?Absolutely.This book follows Grace after the death of her parents, she moves to a small part of Alaska with her Uncle and cousin, Macy to a boarding school they run. After she gets there she learns this might not be a normal school....put two and two together and there's your plot. First of all this book was way to long, at almost 600 pages. There wasn't a ton of plot to go with the length of the book either, alot of nothing pretty much happened.The romance was your typical brooding vampire ala Edward Cullen so of course I ate it up like candy, who's surprised there? Also our main character Grace is annoying, maybe I'm the only one who feels that way.I'm giving this a 3 because it was enjoyable to read. It reminded me of Twilight and even though not alot happened in this book and everything was so farfetched I had a fun time reading it. Go into this expecting not alot but maybe a good time?
