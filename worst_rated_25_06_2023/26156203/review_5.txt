What a wonderfully magical and whimsical book – don’t be fooled though, it ripped my heart in half. I’m personally offended that I have to wait  6 entire months  before the release of the next book. Like um, no my feelings need to be repaired. #Rood The Crown’s Game  is a historical fiction book that fuses magic with Russian history. Vika Andreyeva and Nikolai Karimov the only two enchanters in Russia and with political unrest increasing in neighbouring empires, the tsar needs an enchanted by his side. But which of the two will take that title and walk out with their life?This book is written in such a poetic manner, although some people (as you might have seen from all the mixed reviews) found it to be dreary or tiresome, I found the writing extremely captivating. The world building was described in such a subtle manner, not taking away from the plot but just enough to construct a beautifully enchanting world. What really charmed me was the characters, I must say. These precious little children are so adorable and special and so different from each other yet they are able to build friendships and fall in love (though not always requited).Basically I just really love my baby  Nikolai  and Pasha is pretty adorable too and I sort of love Vika as well. You know what, just give love to them all please. They all deserve love. A little prior to the halfway point, there was almost a second mystery that unwound itself and brought some really  IMPORTANT  information to life and I’m  positive  it will play a large part in the second book.So if you managed to reach to conclude of the story, you would have been blessed with the heartbreak that is the ending. I still don’t understand why that needed to happen, I mean like  WHY CAN’T WE JUST ALL BE HAPPY??!!???!  but no obviously Evelyn Skye doesn’t like to see me without tears. It’s okay though, we’ll all just embrace our tears.
