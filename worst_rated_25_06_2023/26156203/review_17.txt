Buddy Read with who dat aka big boy aka CaitlinWow. It's been around 24 hours and I still am unable to put The Crown's Game into the words I want to. I am still in shock. I picked the book up despite seeing some mixed reviews which would have otherwise drove me away, and then proceeded to read it with one of my favourite people who I met through this site. If I hadn't been reading it with Cait I probably would have DNF'ed it. One thing I can say about this book is that the beginning is slow. It is so horrifically slow that I was frustrated with our characters. I grew to love them though, clearly from my rating of this book. However, since I don't want to say anything about this book in fear of ruining it for you I will put it in gifs. Ultimately, I need to be put in my glass castle (my big boys will understand) and be held by someone because damn. Definitely one of the best books I've read of 2016.
