There is no such thing as a winner in the Game.Oh, you know me. I read Nikolai and Russian historical fiction and I'm gone faster than you can say –ë–ª–∏–Ω!Just kidding, but not really. I went into this book expecting nothing from it and it probably was for the best since I had the chance to fully savor every moment. I was only a few pages in, in fact, when I realized this book is a gem in disguise. Main disguise being that cheap cover. It's probably the only thing I despise about this novel. Seriously, this is everything I'd hoped The Night Circus to be and then some. It has magic, a competition, a beautiful setting, great main and side characters, friendship, love, humor and it's so fast-paced you wouldn't get bored even if you put effort in it. I love love love love love Vika, Nikolai and Pasha, and the writing is so good it was hard to pick a favorite quote to start this review with. Bless you, Evelyn Skye. You've gained a new fan. __#PenguinOnATBRMission: book #11‚óæthis hashtag is something I self-indulgently created for fun when I decided to thin out my immense tbr list as a new years resolution starting from books I added on GR back in 2017/2018/2019, and since I can't seem to do anything quietly and I'm well known for being an overachiever, I had to go and turn it into an official thing. Feel free to check out the shelf with the same name if you don't mind keeping up with this insanely over-hyped adventure I got myself into. Take it as a chance to rediscover some books from a few years ago that might have accidentally flown under your radar, or to simply share with another fellow reader your very own reading experience. Happy reading and stay penguin-y!‚óæTo Be Continued...üêß
