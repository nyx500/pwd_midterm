Update 01/31/2017: I decided to remove a star and change the rating to 4 stars. Been thinking about it and realized that while the book was indeed great, it still didn't feel like a 5 star read for me.***“Imagine, and it shall be.There are no limits.⁠⁠⁠⁠”I have a confession to make. So I have a shelf here on GR named "Not-Interested", and The Crown's Game was under the "Not-Interested" shelf... *gasp* yep. I have sinned in my past life. But then, Cait read it and loved it and recommended it to me, so I was like "fine, will try it" AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. A 5 STAR BOOK. I have seen the light. Great.The Crown's Game is Evelyn Skye's debut novel and there are a few flaws here and there, which is expected. BUT I DID NOT CARE ONE BIT. This book was magical, SO VERY MAGICAL. The magic, the description, the scenery... everything was just so pretty to imagine! The writing was brilliant. Not too wordy and not boring. Also, apparently some people found this boring? Fortunately for me, the pacing was great! Only reason it took me a week to finish was because of my slump, but when I finally got out of it, I read the last 200 pages in one sitting!Also, the world building was so well-done! I wasn't confused one bit. The enhancements were so cool and interesting, as well. NOOOOOW. THE CHARACTERS. I LOVE THEM, OK. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! My favorite is my baby Pasha. #ProtectPashaAtAllCosts OKAY THANK YOU.Our female MC, Vika, is amazing. It's always a big plus for me when the heroine in a fantasy novel is cool because I always tend to dislike them. Vika is clever and headstrong and I just love her! Our male MCs are Nikolai and Pasha. Nikolai is so quiet and brave and *sighs*.... so lovely.You know how a book is all fun and games and then suddenly all hell breaks loose? THIS WAS THE CROWN'S GAME. I was just sitting there reading enjoying it AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS A BIG FAT MESS. Problem after a problem after a problem and I was like "SLOW DOWN MY HEART CAN'T HANDLE THIS!" and then my heart broke. I didn't really cry, just got teary-eyed but my heart broke so bad and I just wanted to throw the book in my trash bin. Yep. This book has so many mixed reviews and I can see some of the problems other readers have with it, but honestly, the plot, writing and the characters were just so good that I just didn't care at all! I definitely recommend it! As a debut novel, I'd say Skye did a wonderful job. GIVE ME THE CROWN'S FATE NOW, PLEASE AND THANK YOU. **Buddy reading with my wife EM ♥
