Review in 2016:Wow! This book was so good! I give this a 4.5/5 stars!(:Review in 2020:  Wow I can see why I rated this four stars last time because it still holds up with how good this first book was! I buddy read this with my friends: Heather, Libby, Tiffany for our book club pick of the month for May and it was really good! Can't wait to read the sequel now!(:
