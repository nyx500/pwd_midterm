[Edit: 8/30/2019] - OMG, it has an IMDB Page!!****************One of my favorite books is going to be a movie...****************I'm very glad my slump made me not read this in the summer this saving it for October so I could listen to the audiobook. (Which was narrated by my favorite narrator Rebecca Soler!!). Anyway, this is a really unique book. It's kind of a fairy tale retelling except it's not actually retelling any tales. So I guess it's not a retelling. Basically, Alice what-her-last-name and her Mom are on the run from their bad luck. But soon Alice starts seeing characters from her Grandmother's mysterious fairy tale book. So basically it's like a dark version of Land of Stories. Soon enough Alice's mom disappears So Alice enlists the help of... Of Shaun? Seamus? I honestly don't remember his name hold on....*Googles *Nope I can't find anything.... I'm just gonna call him Shaun.. So Alice Proserpine! That's her name! Anyway, Alice enlists the help of Shaun to figure out what is going on and where her mother went.The travel all over the place to dig up clues and try to figure out where to go and who to find. At the end, there is a major plot twist and it was amamzing!! In the end, I love this whole novel. It was creative, clever and unique.Bottom Line:5 Stars: WOWAge Recommendation: 12+ (Some scary themes and scenes)TW: Abuse| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram
