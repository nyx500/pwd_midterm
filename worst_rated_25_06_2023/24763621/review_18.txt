Dude. Duuuuuuuude. This. Book. Messed me uuuup. It was slow to start for me. I thought I wasn’t going to like it very much but then sweet Elisabeth went underground AND HUNG OUT WITH THE GOBLIN KING. I was hooked from the moment she went underground. So hooked that I just read over half of this book in one day. I just couldn’t put it down!!I loved Elisabeth as a main character. Her whole life she has been told she’s not good enough, not pretty enough, just not enough. She found herself in the underground and started believing she was beautiful on the inside, and that’s what makes her a beautiful person. The Goblin King. CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT???? He was such a well written love interest. The way he treated Elisabeth was too much for me to handle sometimes because GOALS. Josef🖤🖤🖤 Josef was a blessing. I, too have a little brother that is half of my soul and boi did I relate to their relationship!! I really liked him and his love interest as well. BOOK TWO BETTER HAVE MORE TWIG IN IT. THAT SWEET SOUL, OH MY LORDT. I adore her. One thing I do want to mention, there’s loads about music in here. I ate. it. up. I was in band and choir growing up, so I understood the technical lingo that was used, but other people may not. It’s really a big chunk of the book, so if you’re not into music, or don’t really know how writing/reading music works, you may not like this book very much. ALSO. There are some steamy bits FOR SURE. They aren’t as graphic as ACOMAF or anything, but they are very present. CAN’T WAIT FOR SHADOWSONG💜❤️💜❤️
