This reads a lot like wish fulfillment fanfiction. Besides its well-recycled plot, the novel lacks texture, nuance, depth - things that I notice both young and fanfic writers struggle to accomplish in their works. You should read Laini Taylor's Lips Touch: Three Times for a far more superior "Goblin Market" interpretation.
