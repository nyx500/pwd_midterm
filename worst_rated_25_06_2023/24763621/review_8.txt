every time Liesl said “wantonness” i thought of wontons and let me tell you, that was the best part of my reading experience. you know those books that literally reach out with their painfully beautiful covers and grab onto you?? saying “buy me! i’m pretty”?? well that’s what this book did for me, and tbh I don’t even care… I’m returning it. from the  very first chapter  i was like oh no. this is not heading in a good direction. the family dynamic was so annoying and stupid. Liesl did nothing but whine. Kathe (no, I’m not putting the fancy ‘a’ bc i could care less).let me give you a wrap up. liesl was like “i wish i was pretty!” and “i want someone to  desire  me!!!” and I was just like how about u shut ur gobsmacking mouth?? i don’t think i’ve felt such loathing for an MC before. like i felt no ways for her, there was no connection, she could literally fall into a rabbit hole for all I could care. where was the intrigue??? where was the… scare?? like the goblin king is supposed to be a scary man, no?? STOP IT THIS WAS SUCH A WASTE OF AN IDEA. like he appears in front of her and she just is nodding to all his terms and conditions nothing made sense. nothing made me feel. this was such a sorry excuse for a hades/persephone novel i skimmed the last 100 pgs. i loathed whatever i read. no, really?? what was this. everytime i think about it, i get angry and cannot do anything but scream !!!! someone bring me a match  buddy read with  Nova ✨if I have to see the words  “mein Herr”, “Oh, Elisabeth”, “you, entire”, “Goblin King”,  or  “Der Erlköning”  EVER AGAIN I will scream. ——pre-readingso many mixed reviews, but the second book has a beauuutiful cover & you already know I’m in for it
