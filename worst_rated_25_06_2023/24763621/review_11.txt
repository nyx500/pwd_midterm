**3.5-stars**Wintersong was dark and slightly heartbreaking. With this being said, I will admit that the first 50-pages, or so, were rough. I wasn't sure what to think, but mainly my thoughts were composed of sentiments such as: Do I like this? Do I actually hate this? What is going on? How in hell do I pronounce these names??? With a little patience, it all started to weave together into an intricate, spellbinding story of forbidden love. Perhaps it makes sense considering the story to view it as a musical composition: timid at first as the story begins to unfold, solid and constant through the middle then a resounding crescendo as we rush towards our ultimate conclusion. I was surprised that the romance element of this worked for me. I usually am not into whimsical romances, but I didn't mind this.There are definitely some steamy elements. I even blushed once or twice!The love between Elisabeth and her Goblin King is somehow fractious, violent and childish all at the same time. Their connection is so tangible, I felt it in my heart; the ups and downs of their lustful and rough coming together. The musical elements of the story were beautiful. They helped to bring it alive for me. If this were to be turned into a movie, I believe it would have an absolutely revolutionary soundtrack! Overall, I felt drawn into the story, slowly but surely and once I was in, I was in, entire. I cannot wait to read the next book of the series!
