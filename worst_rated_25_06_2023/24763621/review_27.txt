MY NON-SPOILER REVIEW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMbWt...***Woooow. I've decided on 4.5 stars for this one. I feel that it's waay too good for 4 stars, but still had some very minor little quirks that make me want to bring it down a notch. This book was utterly fantastic. Hauntingly beautiful, lyrical, dark and powerful. I am going to refrain from getting into too many of the details, as I am saving that for my upcoming video review. However, just know that this one was very special. It was such an unexpected treat, and I really love and appreciate when I stumble upon unique fantasy reads such as this one. My only problem now is that I am still stuck in this world! My heart literally hurts from that ending, and I think the only cure is to immediately dive into another fantasy! Does anyone have some recommendations for fantasy reads that are sort of similar to this one? I've literally just been sitting here for the past hour, staring at the wall, in a massive reading slump!!! I'm going to go on a hunt for a fantasy! Thank-you in advance for any recommendations :)
