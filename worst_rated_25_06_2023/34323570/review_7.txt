holy smokes. how come i only just recently found out about this book/series!?! i feel like ive been hiding under a rock. lol. i originally picked this up because i heard there are angels in it and, although i wouldnt necessarily consider this a book about angels, it still met my expectations. and more! what really got me was how there was not one main character i didnt like. usually with multiple POVs, there is one character who i prefer more than the others. so i was surprised when i found myself really enjoying both rielle and elianas stories and everyone included in them (the chemistry between rielle and audric is something else). i also like how both stories feel different, yet connected. i enjoyed the world-building. there was enough to answer all my questions, yet vague enough to keep me guessing. theres just a lot i liked about this. this first installment feels like only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this series. im so excited to dive deeper into the story/world!â†  4.5 stars
