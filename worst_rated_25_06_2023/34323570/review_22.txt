Furyborn is a great introduction to the trilogy. Two queens, a generation apart, tied together by blood and a prophecy. In one generation, a world, free and filled with magic is transformed into a world ravaged by war, very few believe there's such a thing as magic, and killing to survive is a thriving occupation. The only thread between the two generations is the bloodline of the queens, and the villainous, telepathic, evil angel bent on revenge. Eliana, the 2nd generation queen, need to awaken her dormant power and face the close to the impossible task of defeating an ancient evil being. She is all about self-preservation and survival, but to save the dying kingdom, she will need to be self-sacrificing as well; for Eliana, that's a stretch.So far, so good for this series. 3.5 stars.
