“The saying goes, ‘The black tides of heaven direct the courses of human lives.’ To which a wise teacher said, ‘But as with all waters, one can swim against the tide.”Solid world-building, character development and political intrigue in JY Yang's The Black Tides of Heaven. We follow the twin children of the Protector, Mokoya and Akeha, both referred to as 'they,' until they decide their gender. There was a fair bit of focus on their time as children. However, there were a number of big jumps and that was jarring, I think, because these jumps made me feel like I'd missed out on some important development. That said, the writing was good and there were some interesting concepts. 3.5 stars
