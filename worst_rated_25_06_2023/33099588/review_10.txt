This was an excellent little novella. I read it all in one sitting. Even though it was short, the world building is rich. No words were wasted on infodumps, and the story and surrounding world was told organically.The characters were wonderful. Akeha especially, experiences a lot of growth over the course of these chapters. I did not like him at first. I thought he was a little closed minded, childish, too dependent on his sister, but his story grew and really made you care for him.The writing was enchanting, although the story itself is not at all like a fairy tale the writing really whisked me away to another place. The magic system was fun and I loved that it was used for modern purposes (weapons building, technology such as “talkers” [phones], etc.).This was fresh and different and new and well worth picking up. I’ll definitely be adding it’s companion novella to my list.
