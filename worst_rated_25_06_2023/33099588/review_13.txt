They are sold off to the Grand Monastery as children. But when Mokoya begins to developed prophetic dreams, their mother wants her back to use her ability. As well, a rebellion is growing. Unwilling to continue to be his mother's pawn, Akeha leaves the Tensorate and joins up with the rebels, the Machinists. But every step he takes towards the rebels is another step further away from his sister.I really enjoyed this! In such a short amount of time, I really feel like I was able to really get to know the characters and feel for their situations. Which is truly something to say because we cover 35 years in only 230 pages. I also absolutely LOVED the world that was created in this book and am so excited to read the other novella - The Red Threads of Fortune - which I'm guessing is going to focus more on Mokoya. The magic system in this book had a very interesting combination of a solid magic system, technology, and religious influences.It's really unique and the queer representation is AMAZING. Essentially, individuals are all non-binary, or gender non-conforming until they confirm their gender when and if they feel it's right for them. And until their confirmation, they are referred to with they/them pronouns. It's a really unique and fascinating thing that I think is very relevant in today's modern society. And the way that we all shouldn't assume someone's gender, and make sure we know someone's pronouns before addressing them.I personally enjoyed Yang's writing style. I thought it was a good blend of descriptive and straightforward storytelling. Overall, this was a really fun and fast-paced, unique story.
