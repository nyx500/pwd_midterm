✅ Hate-to-love✅ Magic / Powers✅ Action✅🆗 Characters✅🆗 Plot🆗 World-building The reviews for this book are quite mixed, but I enjoyed it even though it is nothing new and it is predictable.  The world-building is simple, but sufficient for this story. The Frostbloods have an affinity (can control) with ice, and the Fireblood have an affinity with fire. They have been at war with each other forever.Ruby was a little annoying at first, she is probably the last Fireblood in the country and she has a tendency to cry and think she is weak and useless, when she is in fact quite powerful, she just needs to learn to control her powers. Arcas is a mysterious and broody man and I liked how he slowly opened himself to Ruby. Even though it was super predictable, I enjoyed the slow development of their relationship and the hot chemistry between them.The storyline was also predictable, but still very enjoyable, I was hooked up at the first chapter, and even though it slows down a bit after that, I enjoyed reading the first half of the book where we discover the characters. The second half is full of action, so really it was easy to read this book quite fast. Ruby has to fight in the Frostblood king's arena near the end of the book and it added a gladiator touch to the book. As I said, there is nothing really new to this book and the romance and plot-line are predictable, but I still enjoyed this book very much and I can't wait to read the next one.“Face them all like a warrior, whether you are one or not.”Follow me on Instagram 🙂
