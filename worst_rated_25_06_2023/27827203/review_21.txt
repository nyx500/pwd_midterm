3.75/5 starsReview Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUF2L...Very particular rating, but honestly it just feels right. I enjoyed this book and although certain factors fell flat, I will be continuing on with this series since I do want to know what happens next. **eARC provided by the publishers through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review**
