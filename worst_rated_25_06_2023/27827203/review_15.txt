This book was a lot of fun! I was wary at first because the synopsis felt like a lot of other YA novels out there, but I was pleasantly surprised. There are a few YA tropes in this story but the author truly makes it her own, and everything just works. I loved the characters, especially Ruby, our heroine. She was sassy and strong, even when she was weak physically. It was interesting from beginning to end and just a really solid story.
