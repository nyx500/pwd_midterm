UPDATEREAD THIS FOR THE SECOND TIME... LOVED IT.I really am enjoying my re-reading journey through books I loved !!I read this book in one sitting today, my god. it was good! Elly Blake has taken a world divided by belief and power. She has created strong characters, with strong bonds. AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE DISPLAY OF THE POWERS IN THIS BOOK.Really really enjoyed this novel and I look forward to reading the follow up...... next year..... omg next year, I might cry if i have to wait long
