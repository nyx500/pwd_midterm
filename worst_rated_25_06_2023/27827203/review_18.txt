3.75/5 - This review can also be found on my blog, Dana and the BooksI've mentioned it before, but my weakness is characters overthrowing the governing power. I've also been reading a ton of YA fantasy lately so naturally Frostblood has been on my radar for a while now.Since moving to England I get 10x more excited whenever Canada is mentioned anywhere, and with author Elly Blake being Canadian, I got extra eager to read it.Overall, Frostblood was an enjoyable read and a solid addition to the YA fantasy genre. While some parts were predictable, I spent a great couple evenings doing nothing but turning the pages, engrossed in Ruby's story. The pacing didn't slow down throughout so you can fly through it quickly - it's the perfect book for a Saturday afternoon binge read!The first 100 pages were jam packed with information and events, but the writing was solid so following along wasn't difficult or confusing.However, a lot of YA fantasy cliches appeared throughout:- Guardian dies leaving main character all alone- Brooding YA Hero who clashes with main character- Wise man- Trains to use powers- Prophecy- Chosen one- Arena battleI am 100% fine with cliches as long as they are done well, and I do feel in Frostblood they were good additions to the story. Apart from one: the Arcus/Ruby romance story line. I know some readers live for the ships, but I'd rather have no romance at all than a seemingly forced romance. Their romance subplot felt strained and compulsory rather than natural and genuine.  After the halfway point in the book, I would skimmed those scenes until the main plot came back.I originally received an eARC via NetGalley in exchange for a review, but I just couldn't resist picking up a copy when I went back to Canada in January. So my review is of the finished Canadian copy rather than the eARC.It's out now! (Book Depository / Amazon US / Amazon Canada / Amazon UK)
