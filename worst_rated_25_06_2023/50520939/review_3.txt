4.5 ⭐️ shiiiit ok i get the hype now. i fucking loved this book. these characters are all literally gay for one another and i ate that shit up, left no crumbs. i’m attracted to every single one of these whores. these characters have a chokehold on me. had my gorilla grip throbbing. had my ovaries shaking. making me all nervous and giddy inside, i felt like i was on crack. the writing? the plot? the characters develop? flawless. A bitch felt smart reading this 💅🏽 these are my new comfort characters. there isn’t one person i didn’t vibe with in this book.libby? fucking adore this introverted queen. i saw so much of myself in her. cant wait for her corruption arc in book 2!!nico? deserves the world and me parisa? bad bitch and she fucking knows it tristen? so down to earth guy and i’m in love callum? smart ass mf, he’s so mysterious i love himreina? gives me asexual vibes. plant mother that takes shit from NO ONE !! here are my ships libby and nico (or nico and gideon; i wouldn’t be mad about it)parisa and dalton (i’m telling y’all that Atlas mf is mind controlling our home boy and parisa is gonna save him!)tristen and callum (they connect so well and just GET each other) my only problem with this book was that is was super slow and didn’t take until more than half way through to get my undivided attention. nonetheless it was a literary masterpiece!!!
