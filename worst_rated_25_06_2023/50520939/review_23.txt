I understand the appeal, but I just didn't mesh well with this one. The positives: I loved the vibes and chill plot. Outside of that, I wasn't a huge fan of the characterization, the lack of world building, and the overall story structure. I fully feel like this was a, it's me! i'm the problem! situation. lol
