I got both of these books in an Owlcrate and FairyLoot box. They have some differences, both with sprayed edges and one with a poster under the dust jacket. I knew I wouldn’t like this book because of animal killings BUT, the book was boring as hell to me and I just didn’t like it.I would also like to beg the book world to let Charlie Bowater do all book covers so some that I love I can keep!! She does have art on Etsy and Society6 that I’m going to collect. As far as the book....no! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
