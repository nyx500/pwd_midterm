This book really surprised me with the characters, I did not expect to like as many characters as I did. The only character that was meant to be likable that I didn’t care for was Sabine, and I thought I was going to prefer her over Ailesse and Bastien. This stories pacing was well done especially towards the end when everything is coming to an end. The plot was very interesting, and I really liked the enemies to lovers romance in this book. One of the things that I didn’t like was how the author didn’t go into more detail of the mythology. Also, the ending I loved it, and it makes me wonder if the new character we meet then is going to be a villain and he is just acting dumb. Overall, I enjoyed this book and I’m looking forward to seeing how this duology will end.
