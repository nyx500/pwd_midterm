So. I enjoyed this book but at the same time there were definitely things that annoyed me about it üòê‚ùå SINCE THERE WAS SO MUCH that annoyed me, I'm just going to list out the annoying items instead of ranting forever.‚á¢ A LOT OF THINGS in the novel were just "too convenient" for me because they only existed to create conflict. When I started to actually think about why certain rules in this world existed or why characters acted the way they did, I came up blank, and I think that's largely my issue with the book‚á¢ THE CHARACTERS kept making dumb decisions that served no purpose other than to create more conflict. It was really frustrating because their actions just weren't believable‚á¢ JULES WAS THE WORST and I honestly couldn't tell if we were supposed to hate her, but her actions pissed me off so much and didn't make sense‚á¢ THE ROMANCE was pretty bland. There wasn't any sexual tension or build-up in feelings between Ailesse and Bastien, which made it feel like instalove‚úÖ THE WORLD AND MAGIC SYSTEM of the Bone Criers was so interesting! I liked how everyone had a unique set of abilities that they had to strategically plan out and fight for ‚úÖ SABINE WAS A WONDERFUL character and her perspective was by far my favorite. She had a really wonderful arc and it was nice watching her grow into a powerful force to be reckoned with to save her best friend ‚úÖ I COULD NOT PUT this book down! There was always something exciting happening! The Bone Crier traditions and rituals were also somewhat secretive, with slow releases of information, so that also kept me invested to find out more about the world and magic systemOverall, even though I had some issues with this book, I still found it really engrossing and that is why I'm still giving it 3 stars.
