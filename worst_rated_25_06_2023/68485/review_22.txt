The only reason this was not a 5 for me was my dislike of the secondary main character and my inability to fathom his appeal for the protagonist. However, it is a great story told in amazing language, a must-read for anyone who likes mannered fantasy.Note: my edition did not have the extra stories mentioned in the description, so if you want those make sure you get the reissue.
