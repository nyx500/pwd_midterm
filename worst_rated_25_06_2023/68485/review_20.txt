I do not like fantasy books at all--particularly those that deal with magic and monsters and the like. I was initially skeptical of how well I would like this book since it is in the fantasy genre, but very quickly I found that I could not put this book down. I have recently re-read it and found it to still be high on my list of favorite books. What did it for me was that this book was not about the things one usually thinks of upon hearing the word "fantasy." There was no magic or mythical creatures or anything of that sort--just a story about a highly regarded swordsman trying to survive the cutthroat world of the elite who use his skills for their personal gains. In the greater scheme of things, both Richard and Alec seemed to be pawns part of a much bigger plot that does not finally reveal it's intentions until the later chapters.Character development could have been improved in certain areas, but was sufficient for understanding the plot. What lacked, in my opinion, was the relationship between Richard and Alec. There did not seem to be any strong emotional tie that bound these two together other than maybe for the sake of convenience--Alec liked to cause trouble and Richard kept him alive when the inevitable fights broke out.Regardless, I took the book for what it was and thoroughly enjoyed it.
