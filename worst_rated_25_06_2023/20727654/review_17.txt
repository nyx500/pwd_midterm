Mostly, this was just badly paced. I liked the beginning of this SO MUCH. The slow unfolding of the world, Ceony learning about paper, the dynamic between the characters.But then the plotty stuff happened! And, first of all, I think it happened too quickly. I wasn't invested enough in the world and characters yet. And I didn't think Ceony knew enough yet.And then the plotty stuff dragged ON AND ON. I was so frustrated with it, but had read enough that I didn't want to DNF it.And I was all ready to ship the main characters, but . . . not the way it was done.And while I'm usually not one that cares a ton about details, a lot of them here really jarred. Particularly all the references to makeup in the very early 1900's.I'm sort of tempted to read the next one, but I probably shouldn't.
