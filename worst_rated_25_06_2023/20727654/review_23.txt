4.5 starsI have a feeling I read this at the right time and mood. I quite enjoyed it. For me, a sign of a good fantasy book is it's ability to transport you. And this one certainly did that for me. I know that several of my GR friends couldn't get into this but I fell into it effortlessly. The setting is in the UK, in the early 1900s but magic exists. There's Smelters who bewitch metal, Polymorphs that manipulate Plastic, Gaffers who enchant glass and so on. Ceony has her heart set on being a Smelter but after all her hard work , at graduation time she is assigned to become a Folder. Folders enchant paper and they are going extinct as no one considers it a valuable magic to have. But Ceony has no choice, it's paper or nothing. Once one bonds with their material, they can never revert it. As she is coming to terms with her fate and the crash of her dreams, Ceony also begins her apprenticeship with her new mentor and teacher, Magician Emery Thane.  But it's not all paper hearts and roses and soon she learns not to underestimate what paper can do. When an Excisioner, a dark Magician controlling blood and flesh, decides to take her teacher's heart with her literally, Ceony is left with no choice but to try and save him.I found all the magic "powers" fascinating and truly unique. I think that's what held my interest throughout most of the book. I wanted to see what more could be done by what power. Ceony is quite a ballsy heroine, especially for it's era, yes she's immature, rash and a bit arrogant but that's how people in their late teens, early twenties often are. It didn't bother me in this book as it fits the situation. It's geared I think for more YA/NA audience. It has no sexy times and very minimal romance. But I was quite enthralled with all the world building regardless. If you feel like a fantasy book, I'd recommend it purely for it's originality with the Folders and their magic. I found those parts the most fascinating.
