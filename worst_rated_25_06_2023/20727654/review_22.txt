In this story, a magically inclined individual versed in the art of Folding can create 'living' creatures, braided belts that protect and vitalize the body, and even beating hearts - all out of Folded paper. This is not your mama's origami. I was hoping for something a bit darker with this Kindle-First freebie, but its fairytale air was charming in its own way. Although there are some semi-wicked sections, there is an overriding innocence to it. The writing was fine, the paper magic was different and interesting, and I absolutely fell in love with the 'real live' dog made of paper.
