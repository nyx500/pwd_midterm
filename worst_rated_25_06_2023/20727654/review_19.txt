DNF 51%Another book that was just not for me. I honestly try not to make a habit of binning books, however life is too short for bad books and I can only put up with so much. I feel like my lack of enjoyment of this book was my penance for picking a book based on its cover ( which is awesome btw).I loved the concept but the execution just didn't work for me. The main character was alright but nothing special. I had no real investment to anyone or anything in this story. Hardly anything happened until 45%ish and even then the action was...lacking.Overall there just wasn't enough happening in this book to warrant the investment of my time. Buy, Borrow or Bin Verdict: BinNote: I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.
