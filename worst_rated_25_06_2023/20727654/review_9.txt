"For the past five years, Ceony had wanted to be a Smelter. However, while most graduates… got to choose what material they dedicated their craft to, Ceony had been assigned."This book was very, very frustrating. Have you ever read a book and wished another author would steal the premise and write a much better book? The premise was fascinating, original and clever. A recent graduate of the Tagis Praff School for the Magically Inclined, Ceony had her heart set on becoming a smelter. You can only magically bond with one material and after your bonding ceremony that material is the only one you can work. Ceony, a scholarship student with a perfect memory, is assigned to paper. An ignoble and unglamorous specialty. Her teacher is strange and possibly mad. What a great premise! A victorian- era, light- hearted, well mannered romance. An action adventure where Ceony uncovers a dark conspiracy of blood workers (a dark and dangerous magic). Dark pasts, brooding love interests. AWESOME… Yeah… not so much. The writing can be really clunky, the love interest develops without any real effort at charisma or even much interaction. And pretty early on stuff gets… weird. Basically, Ceony gets trapped in her teachers heart and travels through his memories. Why create a great world with cool magic and then have the bulk of the story stagnant in a weird dream sequence? Ceony hadn't learnt enough! Not enough had happened in the real world. Her relationship with her teacher had not grown to the degree that what she did made any sense. It was too easy, too weird and too convenient. And it was all over way to fast. It pissed me off. This novel was such a disappointment. Made more bitter by the glimmers of incredible potential.
