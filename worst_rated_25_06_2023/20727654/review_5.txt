This book honestly has A LOT of promise. The writing isn't bad, even if there were many times I didn't feel the author was true to time period or location. The subject matter was interesting and I liked the idea of the world of magic being split this way, bonding to a specific medium. It was also interesting that the world of magic was generally an accepted part of life in this realm of reality. But there were some big flaws I couldn't overlook, including a desperately dragging second half that felt as though it were written as a plea for a screen play rather than a novel. **SPOILERS BELOW**However, what started out as a promising, fascinating book devolved for me when the second half of the book was spent nearly entirely in visions that didn't even belong to the lead character. I didn't understand the logic of bringing the dog on the rescue journey. I think this would have been more powerful or useful to me if this segment of the book had been no more than a third of the book, either with more descriptions of magical life and relationship development in the beginning, or application of the lessons and visions from inside the heart and on the journey to life after the adventure. All in all, there was just way too much time spent on the section in the heart and everything that followed felt rushed, cliched, and predicable in a way that did not utilize effectively anything I'd learned in the trudge through the rescue. I spent the whole second half wishing the book would just move on and get back to the story.
