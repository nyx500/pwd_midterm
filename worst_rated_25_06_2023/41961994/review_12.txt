I’m sad sad sad. This book has a bad ass librarian. A library of all of history’s unwritten books. A library in hell! There’s a character incarnate developing a personality independent of his story. An ex-muse turned assistant librarian. A fallen angel with divided loyalties. A missing demonic bible. A trip through several realms including Valhalla!There’s absolutely no reason this shouldn’t be one of my favorite books of 2019.But it’s sure not.The story is dull. The pacing is slooooowww. I always found it putdownable. While I did grow to care for several characters, and wanted to see how they would fare, I never cared about the actual plot of finding the codex and fighting (sort of?) Uriel. Or the “reveal” of the traitor in our characters’ midst. (It was not at all a shock.)There are a few moments that really shine, which makes it even sadder that the plot never got it together. A few spectacular ideas does not a successful novel make. Also, one question, why the hell (ha. ha.) is the Library of the Unwritten in Hell?? That’s never explained and never made sense to me. It seems the author wanted the shock value of setting her novel in Hell’s library, but wanted an out so her librarian and other characters aren’t “evil.” Sadly disappointing. What could the sequel possibly be about?2 stars
