REREAD 7/20/2020: this remains one of the most unique books i've ever read “whenever she read a book in a binge, cover to cover in a day with little break, she always found it stuck in her brain like a haze. the narrative voice struck with her, and for a bit after, it was always like a walking dream, living someone else’s thoughts.”who knew this book was going to describe exactly how i was going to feel after finishing it. where do I even begin with this review? I truly did not expect for this to live up to its potential because everything about it seemed SO PERFECT for me. but I can safely say it exceeded all hopes and desires. this book is phenomenal and an absolute masterpiece. it has everything you could ever want: lovable, sarcastic characters on an adventure story throughout realms of mythology rapped up in a bibliophilic package. every line in here was stunning. I almost did the unthinkable that is writing in my library copy because I wanted to soak in everything. I truly can’t emphasize how incredible this story is with just my review as I’m not the most articulate. but if you are a fan of adventure, biblical lore, mythology, books about books, snarky characters, & found families with the writing style of comparable to seanan mcguire, you NEED to read this book. you will not be disappointed.
