DNF at page 177I started this book at 3 AM after finishing a 5-star book before it, and it immediately engrossed me and I was loving the hell vs. heaven setting. However, the more I got into this book, the harder it got to pick up, and about half way through I just realized I couldn't care less about the characters or the action. Seeing that it's a three book series was another let down for me because I couldn't bring myself to care about what's happening in this installment, let alone where the next two will be headed. cool concept, but overwritten and difficult pacing.
