this is a very solid 3.5 for me! and honestly, if i read it again, it might be more like a 4. i just struggled a little to follow the audiobook in the middle. read this if you liked good omens, starless sea, and sorcery of thorns (or even if you didn’t like them but liked the idea of them bc yall know i really didn’t like sorcery ahah)
