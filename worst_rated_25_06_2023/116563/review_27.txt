Contemporry urban fantasy for kids, starring two 12-year-olds living on Long Island. Well who doesn't want to discover a book they've never seen before at the library, one that tells you all about careers in wizarding?It's a cool idea, and I really enjoyed reading it, but in some way I can't explain it feels dated.

There's an inclination I don't like in myself, to assume that a series is somehow more hackneyed, less clever, less worthwhile than a stand-alone. Although, of course, I could rattle off a list of brilliant series, and a list of horrible stand-alones. Whatever the cause of the knee-jerk snobbishness, I do consider it a big deal if I want to carry on with a series, because on more than a few occasions (and mostly with mysteries, I think) I've discovered my interest waning with each new installment. I enthusiastically recommended it to the Pandabat who was reading Esperanza Rising and has a stack of other things to read, and declined.Library copy.
