2.5**I love love love Holly Blacks ability to describe enchantment and magic in the fae world. She is also amazing at describing sinister faeries and their playful (often sadistic) games with humans. Her descriptions of settings and the different fae in this book were magical.The issue I had to this book is that I didn’t really care for the characters. I also do not particularly enjoy books that are set in schools (excluding Hogwarts of course!). The plotting and the pacing of this book just didn’t entice me so it took me forever to finish this read as I couldn’t be bothered to keep picking it up.
