4.25/5 ⭐0/5 🌶️The Darkest Part of the Forest by Holly Black is a standalone young adult fantasy about genuinely terrifying fairies, a cursed prince, and two brave siblings caught in the middle. Hazel and her brother Ben live in Farfold a town blessed and cursed by the fae. This story was great. It was good. Ben, Jack, and Severin were all really well developed characters.

Not that tiny little nugget she gave us. Quotes: “Once, there was a girl who vowed she would save everyone in the world, but forgot herself.”“The only way to end grief was to go through it.” “Children can have a cruel, absolute sense of justice. Children can kill monsters and feel quite proud of themselves.”“Her tragedy, if she had one, was to be as normal and average as any child ever born.” “All boys lie," Ben said. "And all girls lie,too. I lie. You lie. Don't pretend you don't.”“Maybe, Hazel decided, maybe they could both learn how. Not just making-up-stories-in-which-you're-happy happiness, but the real thing. She leaned across the bed and hugged him with all the strength in her limbs, hugged him until her bones ached. But no matter how hard she hugged him, she knew it would never be enough."I promise," she whispered. "I'll try.”
