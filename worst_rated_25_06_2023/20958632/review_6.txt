”They were in love with him because he was a prince and a faerie and magical and you were supposed to love princes and faeries and magic people."This LINE!!! It resonated so much with me when I read the book! It describes my love for faeries in the best possible way and I can’t thank Holly Black enough for writing it down! I think this is going to be one of my favourite quotes ever. XDAnd I’m convinced Holly Black and I will have a very long and prosperous relationship in the future! If all her books are at least as good as this one, I’ll give her all my money without even thinking about it!!! *lol*This wasn’t only exactly what I needed but also everything I ever wanted!!!HELL! It was what I craved for all my life!! I’m no fan of nice faeries, I want them to be heartless, seductive, brutal and dangerous!For me it’s no Tinker Bell! Nope! *shakes head*I want the real deal and how they are described in the myths and legends. And boy, did Holly Black deliver! So deliciously that I can’t help but sigh whenever I think about the book. *lol*I mean she even pulled off the rhymes. <333”There’s a monster in our wood. She’ll get you if you’re not good. Drag you under leaves and sticks. Punish you for all your tricks. A nest of hair and gnawed bone. You are never, ever coming…home.”The way she executed everything was just amazing to read!!!The plot:An entire town which is living in coexistence with the fair folk?! CHECK!Cruel, cunning faeries that twist your every word?! CHECK!Mysterious happenings!? CHECK!A magical fairy tale with a bisexual gifted red head, a strong heroine, a gorgeous and cheeky changeling and a seductive sleeping faerie prince who lies in a glass coffin and causes trouble by waking up?! CHECK! CHECK! CHECK! CHECK!!!IT. WAS. SO. FREAKING. MARVELLOUS!!!Do I have to say more?!No?! Then let’s go to my favourite part! The character’s section! ;-PThe characters:If you don’t want to be spoiled you have to stop now, because this is the part where I quote the book and talk about the characters and their development! So yeah, lots of spoilers in your near vicinity! You better tread carefully or you heed my warning and leave now. It’s up to you. ;-PHazel:”The trick was not to let herself think about it too much. Anything that stopped her from thinking would do. Anything that kept her from pressing her hand against her chest to feel the thudding of her own heart and know that each beat was another moment lost.”I really liked that girl! She’s so kick-ass and amazing! I mean she’s turning into a faerie knight in the night and at day she’s just a normal girl! How awesome is that?! Since the Alderking always took her memories she doesn’t remember anything of it though, which really sucks if you ask me. But then again she’s an honest and righteous girl who only wants the best for her people and to say to be one of the Alderking’s knight’s doesn’t fit with her believes as “daylight Hazel” would certainly be putting it more than just lightly. Still, I loved that she always wanted to do the right thing and I hated to see her suffer so much. =( Despite all her bravado she was just a human girl and it made me so sad when her brother finally realised that too! >_<”It was too much. But there was no one else, so it couldn’t be too much. It had to be exactly enough. It had to be what she could handle, and she had to handle it.””Once, there was a girl who vowed she would save everyone in the world, but forgot herself.”Jack:”He’d regretted not riding alongside them ever since they���d come on the first full-moon night. When he refused them a second time, it nearly broke his heart. The third time he was helpless to resist the call. He went, and after, he feared he could not summon up the strength to resist them again.”Oh what a precious bae! This poor boy really didn’t have it easy! I mean everyone in Fairfold knew he’s a changeling and to deal with that on a daily basis must have been so damn exhausting. I could understand his urge to be with his people and to escape his human life and I could also relate to him wanting to live that life nevertheless. Jack was living in both worlds and it was obvious that it tore him apart, especially when the people of his town began to blame him for everything that happened. To fight not only against the prejudices of the people in Fairfold BUT also against those of the Fair Folk hurt him more than he cared to admit and I really hope that he’ll get his “human life” at the side of Hazel! =) Heaven knows he deserves it! *lol*”Your mom and I had a long talk about this last night,” he said. “As far as we’re concerned, the whole town can burn; what we care about is you.””Let me have this time being human,” he said. “Over and over you tell me that I will never be mortal, that the span of one human life is so short as to mean nothing. Fine, then let me have my human life. Let all the mortals I love die and blow away to dust. Let me have Nia for a mother and Charles for a father and Carter for my brother. Let me be Jack Gordon, and when I am done, when all is dust and ashes, I will return to you and learn how to be your son.”Benjamin:”I can’t change his nature, but I can give him the gift of our music. He will play music so sweet that no one will be able to think of anything else when they hear it, music that contains the magic of faerie. It will weight on him and it will change him and it will make him an artist, no matter what else he desires. Every child needs a tragedy to become truly interesting.”My heart bled so much for Ben! What a burden to be so gifted but to be unable to understand it. To fight yourself each and every second of your life, because you have a power that scares you and is so unnatural that no one else is able to help you to deal with it. When I read about him breaking his hand on purpose I didn’t just wince but also almost physically ached. My poor musicians heart! You can kill people in books and I’ll cry you a river but hurt a musicians hands or his instrument and I’m completely devastated!!! The artist in me just can’t handle it. >_< I felt Ben’s pain like it was my own and boy, did it hurt!! Please Holly whatever you do, don’t hurt musician’s in your fairy tales. Such scenes make me feel completely out of my depth! *lol*”Gifted, when he played a tune on a xylophone that made their babysitter weep. Gifted, his sister called him, when he charmed faeries in the woods and saved her life. (And doomed it, too, maybe.) But what he could do scared him. He couldn’t control it.””It has to stop,” he said. “I’ve got to stop. Somebody has to stop me.””We love until we do not. For us, love doesn’t fade gradually. It snaps like a branch bent too far.” To Ben, love was the flame in which he wanted to be reborn. He wanted to be remade by it.Severin:”He was crushingly, heart-stoppingly beautiful.” Severin! *sighs* I loved that faerie boy to bits and pieces!!! Despite his rather tense situation he was still so playful and fun and I found myself enjoying every single moment he was mentioned! XD The story of how he ended up in the glass coffin was such a typical fairy tale and I relished every second of it. *lol* I really wish I could say more about Severin but writing this review I realised that we actually didn’t get to see a lot of him. Even though he was the centre of the story, he actually didn’t appear all too much in it, which is kind of funny but also so damn sad because I really would have loved to get to know him better. >_<”I had no idea how long a single day could be. I didn’t know that the span of a single mortal life would seem interminable as I lay unmoving in that case. I didn’t know.””Benjamin,” Severin said, his voice dropping low. His face was inhumanly beautiful, his eyes as cold as the sky above the clouds, where the atmosphere is too thin to breathe. “I have heard every word you’ve ever said to me. Every honeyed, silver-tongued word.”The relationships & ships:Hazel & Jack:”So what do I wear?”His eyes lit with wickedness. For the first time that day, something had amused him. “Anything you like or nothing at all.”The chemistry between those two was so damn nice! Haha! I loved it when Jack showed his cheeky side and since Hazel is so badass she always knew how to handle him. XD (Even if she didn’t and got slightly insecure. *lol*) I think the revel they went to was one of the coolest things I ever read and I really want to go to one myself. =) I love the way they interacted with each other and I definitely ship them, I’m just really worried about how this is going to end. I mean yeah the book ended but we know that Hazel isn’t immortal and Jack is. So urgh��� I can imagine their future and it’s already breaking my heart. >_<”My life has always been a powder keg waiting for a match.”“Well, hello, match,” Hazel said, pointing to herself with both thumbs, but she smiled as she did it, hoping to take the sting out of the words.”She hadn’t known how solid he’d feel. She couldn’t have guessed how he’d run his hand over her back, lazily, as if he didn’t know how to stop touching her, or how she’d shiver when he did.”Hazel & Ben:”Hazel never cried. She was forged from iron; she never broke. No one was tougher than his sister. The worst part was how quietly she wept, as if she’d taught herself how, as if she was so used to doing it that it had just become the way she cried.”I loved the way the relationship of those two siblings was portrayed. It was so damn realistic and it was obvious that they were really close! They both tried to protect each other but in the end they eventually had to realise that they made a huge mistake by keeping their secrets to themselves. The most beautiful thing about them however, was that they trusted each other blindly. They both knew they had secrets from each other but that didn’t change anything about their trust and bond! And this, my goodreads friends, is so very rare and lovely! <3 ”You and your sister are very dear to each other. To show your regard, you give each other lovely bouquets of lies.””She leaned across the bed and hugged him with all the strength in her limbs, hugged him until her bones ached. But no matter how hard she hugged him, she knew it would never be enough.”Ben & Severin:”What do you think you're doing, grabbing her like that?"Severin slid a little closer, moving as lightly as a dancer. "Oh, you mean instead of grabbing you?"HA!! I shipped them from the very first moment they spoke with each other! *lol* Those two were just too much fun to watch, Severin my poor broken and sentimental faerie prince and Ben my precious bean that was so insecure and damaged. I adored how they got closer and began to trust each other and if there is one thing I didn’t like about this book, then it certainly was the fact that they didn’t get as much room as I wanted them to. XD I know it was necessary for the storyline, but damn, I’d have loved to read more scenes with both of them. =))) ”I love you,” Severin said, looking up, looking at nothing at all, his face exultant. “I love you like in the storybooks. I love you like in the ballads. I love you like a lightning bolt. I’ve loved you since the third month you came and spoke with me. I loved that you made me want to laugh. I loved the way you were kind and the way you would pause when you spoke, as though you were waiting for me to answer you. I love you and I am mocking no one when I kiss you, no one at all.”All told “The Darkest Part of the Forest” was a wonderful fairy tale that kept me reading even though I was supposed to stop. I severely suffered from the “Just one more chapter illnesss” and I enjoyed it so much that I can genuinely recommend it to everyone who likes dark faeries and a little bit of mystery. You won’t regret it! ;-)
