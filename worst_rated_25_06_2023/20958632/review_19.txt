“Hazel, Hazel, blue of eye. Kissed the boys and made them cry.”I hereby demand to have my own horned faerie prince. Someone tell me where to find his glass casket.This was magical (duh). I loved it from start to finish. I think we all know (and Holly does, too) that Holly Black is pretty good™ at writing anything faerie-related. She is just as fascinated with their beauty, horror and wickedness as we are. Lots of times, when I finish a book, I think to myself that I should have read it sooner. This is also the case with TDPOTF. I adored how unapologetic Hazel was, how no one even thought of slut-shaming her for kissing whoever she liked. I also enjoyed - spoiler - the fact that the sleeping faerie prince fell in love with Hazel's brother, Ben. I would love to find out more about their future together and I heard they got a cameo in The Cruel Prince so my fingers are crossed. The only thing I want to criticise is the mass scene at the end of the book. It's hard to keep track on a big cast of characters, especially when they all appear in the same scene, especially when it is the big finale and a great many things happen all at once. That is when it can get a bit messy and, therefore, slightly unrealistic. Overall I still enjoyed every aspect of the book and cannot wait to start The Cruel Prince.Find more of my books on Instagram
