"Anyone who offers up their heart on a silver platter deserves what they get."Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❗This review may contain some spoilers❗In all honesty, I wasn't going into this with very high expectations. While Modern Faerie Tales was a very interesting series, it wasn't entirely Holly Black's best work. At least for some parts. Fortunately, this book had me hooked from page one and did not let go until the end.Holy hell!! What an incredible thrill ride!!! I seriously loved every second of it. It has one of the most intriguing and well-thought-out plots I've read so far. I was completely blown away. Don't even get me started on the mind-melting plot twists. In fact, this was so well-written that it basically overshadowed equally incredible romances. Also, the fact that Fairfold knows all about faeries and how to deal with them. (That might've been my favourite part, actually 😆😆) Holly Black is truly a divine deity of literature. She definitely deserves the hype. Yet, despite her fame (and that of most of her other works), this book seems entirely overlooked in its genre. It has hardly any online presence which baffles me. Sure, the magnificence that is The Folk of the Air series takes up most of the spotlight for all its predecessors, but overlooking such an incredible standalone should be a crime. There's not even much fanart which is what's most sad about it.Hazel was an absolute delight. A charming, badass heartbreaker with some serious secrets and awesome fighting skills. I bet she, Jude, and Val would be vibing so hard they'd become fast friends. (Don't mind me just manifesting 😝😝) She's such a complicated, authentic character, and very relatable. Let's not forget super-weird and a terrible decision-maker. My favourite things about her. Also, you gotta love a feisty redhead with awesome sword skills 😍😍 Her brother, Ben, was also really interesting. He's cursed with a magnificent talent for music and almost as badass as his little sister. I loved the relationship between the two siblings. They care so much about each other, despite their unstable dynamic, what with them falling for the same boy and all, yet they are still prepared to sacrifice anything and everything for each other. Soooo cuuuute, riiight?? 🤗🤗As for the love interests, Jack, the changeling and Severin, the sleeping prince, while they didn't really make it into my infinite list of favourite fictional men, they were still very lovable and well-matched to their respective significant others. They both represent two different, yet equally appealing love interest tropes, the gentleman and the bad boy. I'm more of a bad boy kind of gal but I really liked the gentleman too. 😆😆 Also, both of them are charming in their own way. But what else would one expect from the fae? As I already mentioned, on top of an already incredible plot, there were two equally incredible romances. I couldn't possibly decide which one I liked the most. The chemistry, the dynamic, and especially the words had me swooning like a teenager. These kids know how to romance, despite believing otherwise.Out of all of Holly Black's faerie prequels, this might just be my favourite
