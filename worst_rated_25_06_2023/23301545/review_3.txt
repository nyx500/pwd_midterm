3.5 ⭐️This was an interesting take on the classic story of Sleeping Beauty, with a few new characters that you may recognise. The pictures by Chris Riddell were FANTASTIC. But then I always knew they would be since reading The Edge Chronicles, he is an amazing illustrator.A curse has taken over the castle and is spreading further and further afield. A nearby Queen, along with three dwarves heads into the castle to find out what has caused this sleep sickness, and how it can be stopped.  I found it interesting that the girl asleep is actually the witch, and the old woman wandering around is Aurora – cursed to see her entire family asleep forever, while the witch stole her youth and slept. Also the fact that the Queen was actually Snow White, was a nice little twist. Overall, a good retelling with a few twists.********************Slowly working my way through everything Neil Gaiman has written :)
