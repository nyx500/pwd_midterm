Read this as part of my "Giving authors a second/last chance" challenge and...This is a tough one for me. I can acknowledge that Morgensternâ€™s writing is whimsical but after two books by her leaving me confused and unsatisfied, I have to admit her books are simply not for me.The worlds she creates are fascinating but I don't find myself caring enough about the story in them nor the characters. Frankly, I felt bored.If you've enjoyed The Night Circus, you'll most likely enjoy this one too. If you didn't, I would skip it!
