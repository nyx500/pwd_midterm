This is a review I did not want to write because this is a book I so desperately wanted to love. The Starless Sea is a book written for true readers. I’m talking about the kind of person who spent their childhood in and out of libraries and bookshops; the kind of person who sits and imagines adventure and an escape from the mundaneness of every single endless day without magic: the kind of person who lives for books and reading. As such it is totally enchanting to begin with it. It hooks you in and will promise you storytelling delights, but these promises are false and lead to absolutely nothing but disappointment because the story will lose itself and collapse inward: it will fail in a spectacularly miserable fashion. And it is tragic because this book has been an exceptionally long time in the making. It needed a better editor to polish this lump of rock into the diamond it ought to have been. So, do I think The Starless Sea could have been a good book? Absolutely. What it needed was time, refinement, and a great deal of editing. The prose is written superbly; however, the structure of the book is a complete narrative mess that goes nowhere and becomes terribly confusing as it collapses on itself and forgets the very purpose of storytelling: to tell a story, not simply beguile with pretty words and cool fantasy elements. There needs to be a purpose. I make no reservation in claiming that this book could have been as effective as Gaiman’s masterpiece The Ocean at the End of the Lane. It seriously had that much potential, but it was wasted. And I'm angry, bitter and frustrated because I do not want to write these words. I want to celebrate what this book could have been, not lament what it was not.I suppose two stars will have to do for this brilliantly enchanting book that wasted everything it had and failed to deliver what it promised. _________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________
