After trying to describe my issues with this book, I have found the best comparison. There's a video of a raccoon putting cotton candy in water and staring at it as it dissolves... yup, that exactly how I felt. The writing is beautiful but I'm left empty handed and dissatisfied. I'm left wondering if I read the same book as everyone else and, quite frankly, feeling like I'm dumb because I don't get it.The premise sounded interesting but I was quickly lost and bored. By the end, I was so ready for it to be over.Not for me.
