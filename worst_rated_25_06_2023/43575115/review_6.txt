I am SO disappointed.Bee. Sword. Story. Door. Doorknob. Someone doing something somewhere but loses someone. Owls. Honey. Sea. Bees. Swords. Cats. Stories. Fragments. Smart literary references haha. Bees. Swords. The moon. Clueless boring gay character gets lost, does nothing, stumbles, regrets everything, has no spine. Insta-love - why? He took my hand then lost it. Sea. Trinkets. Books, ribbons, lost, what, maim someone randomly. Hate for no reason. Kitchen. What? Swords. The fortune teller’s son. The fortune teller’s son. The fortune teller’s son. People being waaayyyy too twee talking about recursive storytelling in live theatre vs video games. Such self-consciousness. Doors. Who? Cats? Where? Meaningless pretty endless meandering sentences. Stags. Moon. Books. Lost again. Doors. Doors the fortune teller’s son. Immaturity. Keys. Keeeeyyyyssss. Keys keys keyskeyskeys. Doorknobs. Also, mutilations. Getting lost. Snow. Confusion. Stories. Lost. What? Olden times. References. Books. Stars. Flashbacks, flash forwards. Fragments. Cursed love. I got to 85% before giving up. It made me want to peel the skin off my face.
