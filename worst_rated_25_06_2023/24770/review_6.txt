it's the way this book had a death grip on middle schoolers everywhere, for me.also i was absolutely pretending that i would have been, like, an anti-plastic surgery rebel if i existed in this world, where in actuality i would have been 100% team sculpt my bones and change my face and implant a hoverboard into my ankles or whatever. in fact, on the off chance that this series was a test put out into the minds of 13 year olds by the government, write me down as "pro authoritarian government changing my thoughts so i'm bubbly and happy all the time."ignorance truly is bliss.part of a series i'm doing where i review books i read a long time ago and try to access the mind of preteen me.
