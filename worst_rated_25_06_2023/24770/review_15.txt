Seeing this book always popping up every time I searched for best YA novels, I knew I just HAD to read this. I've been actually saving this trilogy for a special reading occasion because I am really into dystopians and discovering this series was written even before the Hunger Games, I expected that I will be more than impressed. Sad to say, the book did not meet my expectation. Sure, the concept is cute- every one at the age of 16 gets operated on to become pretty while every body else is considered ugly, that's something to look forward to. Unfortunately, the plotting of the story is too linear with the introduction taking up most of content. My, I've already read 200 pages and I still felt like I was still reading unnecessary backgrounds and introductions. The slight bumps of the story only take place when it's almost finished and I'm sure any dystopian novel written that way cannot be properly appreciated. For me, any dystopian novel should start and end with an explosion- something captivating that will hook the readers up from beginning till finale. I'm afraid that even if I want to know what happens to Tally and David in the story, I think I'm going to just have to rely on online summaries of the succeeding books because I wouldn't want to go through another agony of reading so many pages mostly wasted on unnecessary details.I’ll give a merit to this book though. I think the hoverboards are cool. They make me imagine of green goblin’s ride. :)
