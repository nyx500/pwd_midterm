Things become quite one-sided (or one-dimensional) in this YA dystopian yarn that imagines stuff in a... half-assed kind of way (repressive governing scientists: too uninteresting an antagonist, a teenaged character with absolutely zero references to the parental unit, scant description/character development...) presenting tropes for the new young'uns (and hopeful lifelong readers) to gawk at but offering nothing much too pleasant for the reader that's more enthralled by the complexities of that OTHER YA epic, "Hunger Games," if at all. I mean, why does pretty=superficial, ugly=raw? Why can't pretty people also be good (thanks for corrupting my brain, Disney!)... It's... Its just too... vapid. Yeah. And it really doesn't quite pick up til the third act (page 270 or about). & it doesn't stand on its own, but requires for the rest to follow to be read (I'd rather go... run outside!) to assemble something even somewhat, ya know, SOMEthing...Eh. Sigh. My exploration unto this terrain seems to be at its ultimate, most dissatisfied conclusion....
