ive read this book/series a handful of times over the past decade or so and have somehow never written a review for it. time to fix that. although some of my feelings have changed as ive gotten older, its impossible to get rid of the strong feeling of nostalgia this evokes each time i pick up the book. what drew me to this story when i was a teenager still remains as an adult. i love how this personifies the notion that true beauty is who you are as a person, not what you look like. yes, this is done superficially with classic early 2000s dystopian drama, but the idea still stands. i think this is an important topic in YA culture - one i definitely needed back than and still does good now.so the 5 stars remain, if for sentimentality alone. â†  4.5 stars
