I don't know what happened here. A 300-page book from my fave writer that felt like 800 pages. Massively disappointed.I love urban fantasy, I like the familiar cocktail of worldbuilding + mystery + romance delivered by a charismatic narrator. Not gonna lie, the series that work for me are the ones that have hot romance, and Book of Night just doesn't have one. Objectively speaking, there is nothing wrong with the worldbuilding or mystery here. But because the novel is written in 3rd person, it doesn't have the driving force of an engaging narrator. In theory, Charlie should be interesting and a compelling train wreck (a la Stacia Kane's Chess), but she isn't. And the romance... Well, all good stuff happens off page, you kind of jump into the relationship when it is fully formed, so there is nothing and nobody to fall in love with. There is no tension, there is no smut, there is nothing!I am crushed. There is a setup for a sequel at the end, but I have no desire to put myself through this Book of Boredom again.
