*Updated*: scroll down to find the updated paragraph of my review"Charlie Hall, at her best when doing her worst. Whenever she tried to create something, it broke apart in her hands. But blowing something up? There, Charlie had an unerring instinct for greatness."Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❗This is a spoiler-free review❗I am officially left with one exam. I also sent the final draft of my thesis just moments ago, so wish me luck on that 🙏🏻🙏🏻 I hope all the tears and sleepless nights were worth it.I decided to write a spoiler-free review of this book, something I don't usually do since this book has only been published so recently. It also marks Holly Black's adult novel debut which was reaaally exciting. Just seeing the word 'fuck' in a book written by a children's and YA author was so strange and intriguing. It felt so scandalous 🤭🤭 I also did not expect the lack of spicy sex scene (I'm so used to erotic romance novels I don't know what's normal anymore 😅😅), although that didn't bother me in the slightest. The book didn't need it anyway. I feel like I should say this: the cover is beautiful in its simplicity. Yes, I've seen better but I loved it anyway. I didn't expect the story to be so fast-paced, to be honest. I thought it would start slow like The Cruel Prince (love that book, love the whole series). It was a pleasant surprise.Charlie Hall was likeable from the start. She was funny and loyal to those she loved, despite her reputation, and she proved that intelligence is not solely defined by degrees. She has been through a lot of shit that left her a human mess. Holly Black sure has a talent for beautiful, morally questionable, and incredibly self-destructive characters 🤩🤩 I am one hundred per cent sure that Charlie and Cardan would vibe haaard and definitely cause some mayhem in their wake. I can practically picture Jude and Vince there just shaking their heads in exasperation and faint amusement. I really really like Vince, even though I was reluctant to do so at the beginning. He was basically a more emotionally stable Jude with an equally fucked up past and unexpected secret. I actually wished he had more chapters than just moments from his past. Also, he is yet another man I CAN NEVER HAVE!!!! That's just not fair 😭😭 It's always: 'I love you' Never:"Last night, after you fell asleep, I couldn’t stop looking at the swell of your cheek. The snarl of your dark hair. The chipped black nail polish on your toes, curled up against whatever dream you were having. The way you pulled loose the bottom sheet with the violence of sleeping. I looked at you and had a feeling so intense that it made me dizzy and a little sick."I did not really care for Charlie's sister, though. At first, Posey was giving me really intense Taryn vibes (meaning she looked suspicious and prone to betrayal), but that was mostly the irreversible damage Holly Black has caused me with The Folk of the Air. I did realise soon that she wasn't exactly like that, she was less of a bitch than I initially thought, but it didn't really help me like her any more than I already did.The thing that I will always ALWAYS love in contemporary paranormal novels is the pop culture references. It makes me feel as if that fictional world can be a part of my boring one, and I totally pictured a Marvel multiverse situation. As if I could somehow travel to a world where everything is exactly the same but magic made it less dull. What I liked the most about it, however, was the references to real short stories that involve shadows like "The Shadow" by Hans Christian Andersen. I am willing to bet that had a lot to do with Black's inspiration to write this novel. I haven't read that short story but seeing it mentioned in such a great book reaally made me want to read it. Update here:As for that ending...ooooh...that ending. I initially rated this book 4 stars because it seemed to me that it was a standalone and if that were true, then that ending would be the cruellest thing anyone could ever do to a bookworm. But today (07-05-22) HB announced that this is, in fact, a series. A duology to be more precise. So, I will get to see my favourite con artist and her weird boyfriend again. It's not over! There's more coming! 🥳🥳I swear I couldn't be happier. Not only are we getting a brand new spin-off The Folk of the Air duology, but we are also getting more of this absolute masterpiece of a book. So, I change my rating to 5 AWESOME STARS!!! I seriously squealed so loudly, that only dogs could hear me.Bonus Original Fairytale: The Girl with Three Shadows:Bonus Story Link Here!Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⚠️Trigger Warning: Gruesome deaths⚠️I FOUND IT!!! I FINALLY FOUND IT!! Bless the Reddit user who shared it. You are a true hero to all of us bookworms. I have been looking for this bonus story for weeks now.This was an absolute delight!! Truly amazing!! I loved it sooo much. Holly Black sure knows how to write good, authentic-looking fairytales. I really liked the eerie, grim vibe it had going on, also it was really short and to the point. I always like that. If I didn't know it was hers, I would easily believe this is a real fairytale story from the past and not just a part of a fictional world.Its authenticity probably comes from the story being really similar to the French folktale, "Bluebeard" by Charles Perrault. For those of you who don't know, this folktale tells the story of a wealthy man who habitually murdered his wives, and one wife's attempts to avoid the same end. In fact, it is the exact plot of HB's fairytale story, but with a more weirdly magical, shadowy twist and super strong girl-power vibes."Bluebeard" might have actually inspired this fairytale, as HB has a noted tendency to derive from various stories/fairytales and implement them in her books. She has referenced Hans Christian Andersen's "The Shadow" in Book of Night, and even referenced Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in her The Folk of the Air series. (I mean, Jude's story is basically a really cool retelling of Lewis Carroll's children's book.)Only one question arose in my mind (which does so often with old fairytales): Why didn't the girl just use her shadows to kill that baron-jerk right away and get this thing over and done with quickly? I mean, she heard the rumours about him. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️Holly Black should expect my therapy bills very soon.
