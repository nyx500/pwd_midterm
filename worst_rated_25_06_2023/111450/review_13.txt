I'm not a sports fan as many others are. However, I do enjoy watching some soccer matches whenever there is a European or World Championship. When I watched Harry Potter, I was amused by the wizarding sport #1, Quidditch, but nothing more. Then came the 4th book/movie and with them the Quidditch World Cup and I was enamoured. The atmosphere of the gathering (before it all went wrong), the intricacies of the rules and mascots and rivalries and the games themselves ... the enthusiasm was palpable and I'm not in the least bit surprised that there are some people in this world that actually are playing Quidditch and holding tournaments.This book is one of two school books of Harry's that can be found in the library of Hogwarts. He reads it in preparation for becoming the seeker of Gryffindor. Thus, the reader, like Harry, is taught the history and regulations of the sport through very quirky and funny chapters.This particular edition is the brand new audio version narrated by Andrew Lincoln who does a superb job. Many will be surprised and not actually count on his native British accent since he's faking an American one so well on TWD. But believe me, the man is very much British. Want proof? Here it is.J.K. Rowling published this, as the other school book, in support of Comic Relief and - now - Lumos which makes the purchase a good deed on top of a must-have for any fan.And yes, this new release of an audio version, lining up with the release of so many other special editions (also due to the anniversaries), has sparked hopes in many fans (myself included) that this quirky little addition to the wizarding world will one day be adapted for the screen as well (preferrably with Andrew Lincoln in it). *squeals*
