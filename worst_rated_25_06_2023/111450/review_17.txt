"  - Irma Pince, Hogwarts LibrarianNoted ma'am. I obviously had to read this book because I'm planning on trying out for the quidditch team 'Holyhead Harpies' (I'm NOT kidding). Here are some fascinating things I learnt about quidditch: * Apparently before the quaffle was invented , they used inflated bladders of goat( okay that's weird).*The goalposts used back then were baskets instead of hoops.*A small bird called a snidget was used instead of a snitch back then. The game was won once you caught and killed the snidget. The M.O.M banned this because.... ANIMAL ABUSE!! *Quidditch was first played at a place called Queerditch marsh and the players were referred to as numbskulls by the onlookers . (oof) "Oh the thrill of the chase as I soar through the air,with the snitch up ahead and the wind in my hair.As I draw ever closer the crowd gives a shout,But then comes a Bludger and I am knocked out. " Haha so anyway I have to go. I've got team trials now. I'm trying out to be a beater , wish me luck ;)After having said all this, why did I give this three stars? I don't know.
