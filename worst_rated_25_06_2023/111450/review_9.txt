I reread this for the first time in probably 15 years and it was super fun! I listened to the new audiobook narrated by Andrew Lincoln (with extra bonus content) and I loved it! I will say I stopped listening to the bonus content after like, 30 minutes because it got really boring. You're basically listening to Ginny reporting on the preliminary rounds of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup and I honestly was super bored by this part. But the original book is great. Humorous and informative and a lot more fun than I remember it being!
