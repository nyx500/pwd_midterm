My students are reading the first two Harry Potter books. Once they are done there will be a little bit of time left before the school year ends, so we are going to read this book. I just finished the book and created my own student workbook and homework assignments because there are none on this book. If you are a teacher and would like a copy of the material I'd love to share. I worked way too long and hard on it, to not share it :pThis book is about Quidditch; the most popular sport in the wizarding world and especially at Hogwarts. This book is written like a text book that the students at Hogwarts were able to check out.Update: My students really enjoyed this book!
