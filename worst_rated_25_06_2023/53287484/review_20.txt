"A girl can dream." "Is that what you dream about? Being a monster.""Not exactly. Mostly I dream about being with you forever." ~•~•~ "I love you more than everything else in the world combined. Isn't that enough?""Yes, it is enough. Enough for forever."This time I spoke of the real forever. My eternal forever.  Guess who enjoyed her re-read? And it's not even like I read a new plot it's the exact plot of Twilight just in Edward's POV. But much more better. This book took me by surprise. Compared to Bella's perspective and Jacob's (in Breaking Dawn) I found Midnight Sun to be much more insightful, which makes Bella's perspective a bit dull. We see the internal struggle Edward has to deal with to be around Bella and his journey from hatred to curiosity to eventually love. We get to see the conflict between Rosalie and Edward and how close Emmett and Edward were. These things weren't picked up by Bella. The fact that Edward was so much detail oriented, attentive towards Bella is heartwarming. My guy remembers everything about her. One thing that I found interesting was the encounter with Siobhan. I can't believe how underrated she is in the Twilight Saga. The woman's gift is to visualise outcomes and will it to reality. HOW IS THAT NOT TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH?! Doesn't that make her even more powerful than Aro? It baffles my mind. Apart from that, the number of beautiful quotes this had in it made me swoon. Edward is such a romantic at heart despite his self loathing. I wish Stephanie would've done the whole series from his perspective but I guess that's not happening. New Moon would've definitely been an interesting read. (One can only hope she surprises us with it). Until then.. can't wait to reread this series...again.
