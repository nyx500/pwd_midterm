is this a book we all really needed? no.is this a book we all deserved? you better believe it.reasons why i gave this 5 stars - nostalgia and edward. thats literally it. and honestly, i wish SM had written the original books from edwards POV. i enjoyed this soooo much more than ‘twilight’ because i dont have to deal with bellas whiny thoughts. lol. ↠ 5 stars
