Look, I’m doing this for high school Lindsey. She had to suffer through the low-rise jeans phase, so I owe it to her.Even though she and I will NEVER be cool with Bella’s floor-length khaki skirt.————————————————————————Update: DNF at 34%Look, I can’t do this even for low-rise jeans high school Lindsey. I’d like to say she’d understand, but the day Stephenie Meyer posted the leaked chapters on her website, high school Lindsey drove to the public library after school just to read them. And she loved them.High school Lindsey was a moron.Edward’s POV adds nothing new to the story. It’s mainly just him going on and on and on and on about every little thing. So much so that I, an annoying AF over-thinker, couldn’t tolerate it. Bella may be one-dimensional, but at least she knows how to move the plot along. Edward is incapable of doing so. Also, a lot of the dialogue didn’t really make sense from his POV. It’s almost as if Stephenie Meyer was writing all of these inner monologues for Edward and then remembered she needed to include the dialogue from the first book, so she just plopped it in random places. None of his thoughts are snarky or amused, but his dialogue certainly is. The two don’t match. And yes, yes, I’m aware not everyone says what’s they’re thinking. But, there were parts in Twilight where he seemed genuinely amused by Bella. Yet, none of his thoughts reflect that. Thus, it feels patched together.Really a shame this didn’t come out 14 years ago. High school Lindsey would already own a pillow case of the cover. As it is, present day Lindsey is still suffering from the effects low rise jeans had on my hips, SO I AM NOT EVEN SORRY FOR QUITTING THIS.
