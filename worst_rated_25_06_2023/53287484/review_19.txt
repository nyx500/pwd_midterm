I finally finished Midnight Sun, so here is a compiled list of my Thoughts™* most days I can hardly muster 3 words to describe my overall existence, but my boy Edward here spends pages describing how Bella’s eyes react to the light and let me tell you, that shit is lit 👏😂* “A word I’d never said before in the presence of a lady slid between my clenched teeth.” - Edward, honey, it’s fine, you can say fuck 🤣* Edward Cullen falling for someone - a reaction in 5 steps: - shout NO dramatically in front of your family - view this as a “destruction of my life” and a “mutilation of my future” - stalk out dramatically out of the house, into the rain - writhe internally in agony - run through the mountains, in the rain, contemplating your existence, like the dramatic queen that you are* “High school. Purgatory no longer, it was now purely hell. Torment and fire… yes, I had both.” - I dare y'all to name a more dramatic, over the top bitch than Edward “my life is agony” Cullen* Edward Cullen discovering jealousy: “I didn’t understand this emotion - it was such a tangle of pain and fury and desire and despair. I had never felt it before; I couldn’t put a name to it.” - yes boo, welcome to the highs and lows of Feelings™* “Suddenly, as she ate, a strange comparison entered my head. For just a second, I saw Persephone, pomegranate in hand. Dooming herself to the underworld. Is that who i was? Hades himself, coveting springtime, stealing it, condemning it to endless night.” - name 👏 a 👏 more 👏 dramatic 👏 bitch 👏* Edward’s idea of a “state of undress” is wearing a short sleeved shirt, i’m howling; for real, he is in mental anguish over wearing that shit* “I swallowed Bella’s tear. Perhaps it would never leave my body. After she left me, after all the lonely years had passed, maybe I would always have this piece of her inside me.” - Edward, honey, I like you boo, but what the FUCK* Edward literally decided to think all the thoughts and use all the words in the dictionary. All of them. Just… why the fuck not* Emmett is the one reason to give this book a try. He constantly calls Edward kid. His general attitude towards everything is a flip between yolo and “can i murder that”. He’s basically like “edward, man, you’re fucking weird, but i’m bored, so let’s do this, i guess”* “there are other hungers, I continued. Hungers I don’t even understand, that are foreign to me” - a Very Dramatic way of saying that you’re horny, courtesy of Edward “my mind is impure” Cullen* this book had NO business being as long as it was, but it was peak nostalgia™ and i loved every second of it* at the same time, i swear to fuck, i don’t think i’ll ever reread it, edward’s mind is an exhausting place to live in lmao
