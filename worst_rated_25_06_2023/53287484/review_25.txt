Update 4I give up on this book...I just CAN'T keep up with whiny sparky vampy EdwardWe have DIWALI here in India tomorrow!!For those of you who don't know what Diwali is... it's our festival where we LET GO of negative things and celebrate a new beginning And I am LETTING GO of this book before Diwali starts xDI just can't celebrate it while this book is haunting my TBR!!Its me burning this book in fireworks btwthis book needs NO introduction AND MANY awesome reviews have been written anywaysWhat I will do is express my feelings of the 20% I read through memes *Everyone on GR pretends to be shocked*My concern is Edy killed a spider for Bella...NOW, what if that spider was Lucas the Spider??!!Yes, guys!! this is Lucas!! Look how adorable he is!! LUCAS NEEDS JUSTICE !!Honestly, I would rather read a book with that spider's POV than Edy *cringes*I am not gonna write how awful this was BECAUSE sooo many other reviews have done a better job at itIt's just Edward felt like a horny emo boy IMOI mean Bella was not just like "other girls" BIUT she was not like "other humans" too!!Also, why was EVERY guy crazy over Bella??!! I haven't read twilight so I don't exactly know how Bella is BUT even from Edy's POV she seemed borrrrring!!I am not saying I have a very "happening " life...Even I am a basic bitchBUT I am AWARE of it !! And tbh every other girl I know is the same !! sooo we are like each other!!NO SUCH THING AS "NOT LIKE OTHER GURLLLLLLS" !!!I mean it got soooooo repetitive !! And Edys pov wasn't even interesting !!So I kinda get why he might like herBOTH THINK they are special snowflakeLUCKILY I did not read Bella's POV..cause I think it would have been even traumatizingJust gonna stop here cause not much to sayNOTE: I DONOT intend to make fun of anyone who liked this series..It wasn't for ME. My problem was with the book NOT the author or readers who enjoyed this. I hope no one takes this personallyðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤—Kinda Buddy read with The one who went MIA The one who tried her best to keep this be going AND OFC The one who dragged us all into this messUpdate 3Lets start with a diagram...W1=Window no.1W2=Window no.2BS= book shelfThat weird thing in the corner=DoorSpecial mentionsBookshelf(duh)Kitchen..which is accessible through the door(kitchen is imp..its keeps me well fed)Mrin=Thats me saying "Hii" to you guysNow before reading Midnight Sun..Mrin NOT afraid of windows..having a peaceful sleepAfter reading it..terrified of windowsYou see..I have TWO HUGE windows & I am TERRIFIED of them nowEspecially after reading the scene when Edward is just watching Bella *shivers*Yo can thank me later for the drawingsðŸ˜‚BUT I HAD to explain to you guys why I am terrified of them...Please ignore the AWFUL drawing..I know its badðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚I just wanted to orove my pointUpdate 2Starting this chaotic BRI WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR MANY OF US WERE forced coerced into reading this book...Actual footage of MONICA/KAZ dragging me into this BRUPDATE 1After seeing all the updates on GR about this book...Mrin be like...Mrin who hasn't read the books but knows the main storylineBUTI haven't read a single book in the series BUT I do know the story....How you ask??!!One of my closest friend is a Twilight fan...She did tell me the story & forced coerced me to watch some of the scenes in the moviesI think I will gift her this book for her bday...So I do know whom Bella ends up with & "The fetus position crying scene" BUT I am clueless about the rest of the storyFor ME the title of this book is "The pomegranate book"ðŸ˜‚Some of my GR friends came up with the nameWhile I am curious to know the reaction for this book..I think I will let my other friends read this book...If they find it good..I might give this a tryP.S.: I think I am probably not making any senseðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚I think I will just call my friend & ask her for the summarySoooo I won't have to read the entire series & I can still read this BOOK!!!RN I am feeling like a multitasking proðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽIf you think group video call with family is easy...you haven't met my familyMy family is quite big....so it gets confusing when everyone tries to speak at the same timeðŸ˜‚ #IndianfamilyproblemsOhh...& the deal with the Devil....The Devil mentioned is my friend TANI ...She is trying to make me read a book...in exchange for reading my favorite series aka THE LUNAR CHRONICLESðŸ˜‚Something tells me..I am gonna lose this deal & end up giving my soul to her (I know I am being OTT dramatic..Just bare with meðŸ˜‚)
