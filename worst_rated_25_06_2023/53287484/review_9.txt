5 stars “For just a second, I saw Persephone, pomegranate in hand. Dooming herself to the underworld. Is that who I was? Hades himself, coveting springtime, stealing it, condemning it to endless night.”Midnight Sun is a book I’ve been waiting for for over 12 years and let me tell you, it was so worth the wait! I honestly thought this day would never come and as soon as I saw the book was available, I preordered the hardback for my collection and the audiobook. I listened to all 25+ hours of this and the narration was AMAZING. Jake Abel did a fantastic job voicing Edward. I can’t recommend the audiobook enough.I loved being in Edward Cullen’s head. Absolutely loved it. Yes, this is a Twilight retelling, but this is much longer than Twilight and so much was expanded on. I loved getting more from the Cullen’s and with Edward being able to read minds and all, you really did get to see more from so many of the other characters in this book. Plus just knowing Edward's side of things and what he was really thinking was truly a treat! I also have to say, I think Stephenie Meyer's writing has only gotten stronger with time. If you’re a diehard fan of the Twilight Saga like me, I highly recommend giving this one a go!
