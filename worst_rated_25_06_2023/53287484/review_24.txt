I'm still not sure what I think about this. At one point in my life, I liked Twilight then when re-reading I could not believe what I saw in those books. But despite all that, Twilight definitely brought a change to the book scene. Just think about all those authors who started by writing Twilight fan-fiction and how many Twilight fan-fiction stories were "reskinned" and published!Overall, I have three things to say about this.1) I'm not really sure if I'll be reading this.2) I love pomegranate, but this one is... making my skin crawl a bit for some reason? Before I looked closely, it looked like bugs or something. 3) Should I get my hopes up again that we might see the rest of The Host books? Anyway, I'm really happy for all of you who adore Twilight that you'll finally get this book! And I'm really curious about how it will be received.
