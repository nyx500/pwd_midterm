This was the perfect recipe of so many of my favorite things. An original world with mythology and gods and dream magic. Themes of love and bonds and vows and family. A slow burn romance that is a major plot point but is woven into the plot so masterfully that it doesnâ€™t distract from the plot. A fierce powerhouse main character, who is both fragile and strong. Lines that brought me to tears. Full review on my channel to come with lots of gushing and probably little coherence but just know I love this.
