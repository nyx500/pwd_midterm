I now have a YouTube channel that I run with my brother, called 'The Brothers Gwynne'. Check it out - The Brothers GwynneMy expanded review for Empire of Sand is now on Booknest! Looking forward to the publication of the sequel in a few months... Empire of Sand reviewEmpire of Sand was a great debut by Tasha Suri that I thoroughly enjoyed. It has definitely made sure that I will read its sequel, Realm of Ash.The world building and culture was efficiently depicted, and something I easily understood although I have not read many books with the influence of Indian culture.The main character was someone who I really enjoyed following as a PoV as they were really believable and had such an intriguing plot-line within which she battles social class, race divides and gender expectations. Mehr was a likeable character with faults that made her 3-dimensional and allowed me to bond with her. The villains were also cleverly portrayed with so much of their character being revealed in every encounter and interaction.  I hated the Maha!The plot-line was unguessable to such an extent I never had a clue what would happen in the next chapter. This was very refreshing as in most books it is easy to discern at least a portion of the upcoming story.The only thing I wanted more of was action, as that is one of the main things I look for most. But although there was not as much in Empire of Sand as I am used to, I still really enjoyed it and imagine those with similar tastes to mine will as well.So Empire of Sand was a very unique read for me that is different to almost everything I have read before. It focuses on character building and has an interesting world. I look forward to Realm of Ash being released in a few months?
