Matched drew me in with it's unique summary and beautiful cover, unfortunately that is where my fascination ended.I wanted to like this book.... actually I wanted to love it, but I didn't. I had a very hard time getting though this novel. I even had to take a break from it completely, and I only kept reading because of the encouragement from others that had read it, insisting that it would get better. It didn't get a whole lot better for me.I guess my biggest problem was that I was bored for most of the novel. I was bored with the story, the characters.... everything. Cassia was selfish, and dull. I tried to like her, but she never really gave me much reason to. Her relationships with Xander and Ky were impassive, I understand that Xander was 'chosen' for her, so there were going to be fireworks every time they touched, but I still didn't even understand their appeal as friends, not just as a romantically involved couple. And the obsession with Ky... why? And that's all that it felt like to me, an obsession. I didn't feel or see the energy between them.The Society wasn't explained very well. Why is The Society there? How did it come to be? Why the current precautions? Why are there people that live in The Society and others that don't? There is a war going on? Why? Where? With who? I had more questions than anything.I didn't know enough about the characters and the life they were living to really care about them. It felt like a very long prologue to another story.The few chapters at the end of the story piqued my interest somewhat, but even then it was tainted with how I had felt through most of the entire novel. It was beautifully written... but I just couldn't get into it.Still undecided on reading the rest of the trilogy.
