After all the SF, this is a good epic fantasy set in Japan (or a place that is very much like Japan) as the gods and culture are all similar to Japanese ancient gods and culture. I like that the story uses the Japanese pantheon - a unique aspect for fantasy. There is also some "Steampunk" aspects, but it's more "Lotuspunk" as the main fuel for this world is from the lotus plant. And it's a dirty, polluting fuel, that turns the sky red and if you don't have a good respirator over your face, you can die of "black lung." Interesting world and culture and characters. I think the world building is wonderful, but a bit...repetitive. Yes, I know it's polluted. Yes, I'm aware of what will happen if they find out what the main protagonist can really do. etc... I started skimming over the details after a while.I picked this up because of the title - Stormdancer - I have Stormdancers in my Glass series of books and wanted to see if they were similar - they're not. And also because it was written by Jay Kristoff - I enjoyed the Illuminate series very much and wanted to see what he did with a solo fantasy book. He did a good job!
