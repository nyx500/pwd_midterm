Blog review:https://edwardsghostengine.wordpress....This totally took me by surprise! For some reason when I started reading this I thought it was set in a post apocalyptic Japan and that after the world fell people went back to the old religions and beliefs and started living menial lives again. I mean the polluted atmosphere of the Shima isles made me lean on the sci-fi side. But further into the book I realized it was set in a fantasy world. Which only made the novel richer and even more enjoyable!I'm no expert on Japanese customs..... (even though I've been to Japan 4 times now and it was AWESOME!) ahem so like I was saying other people have claimed that the Japanese used in this book was incorrect which I can't comment on as I'm no expert. But despite that the book has a very realistic and authentic feel and the descriptions are so rich it made me feel like I was there with the characters. Other people have also been annoyed by the world building saying it was too over descriptive but that's one of the things I loved so much about this book! I can't say enough times how much I love mythology and learning about other cultures and religions, history, travelling and different settings has always fascinated me. I also like to see a high fantasy novel set in a different culture apart from the stereotypical medieval Europe based high fantasies (I mean don't get me wrong I like them too I just feel they're used too much).I would seriously recommend this series to anyone who wants a different high fantasy and likes lots of action and detailed settings.
