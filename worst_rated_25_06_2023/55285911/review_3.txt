Edit: nvm dropping this to 1 star because i really did hate this :/----Nothing hurts more than having one of your most anticipated reads by one your favourite authors be a huge disappointment.I guess my streak of 4/5 stars had to end eventually.But wow, why did 338 pages feel like 1000 pages???I don't know. It might just be me but the whole time I was reading this, I felt absolutely nothing. I was honestly bored out of mind and considered marking this as 'DNF' many times, but I thought "Oh, maybe it'll get better....?"Spoiler . . . It didn'tAlso, one thing to know about me is that very rarely do I give out a rating below 3 stars. It makes me feel like a cruel monster human being who's being very harsh, but I just really couldn't love this as I thought I would.😬I didn't feel attached to any of the characters. Luella was kinda alright in the beginning and had me laughing once, but in the end, I didn't care much about her. She was pretty boring honestly.Oh and don't even get me started on Eldas. If possible, that guy was even more bland than the rest of the cast. You see, when I saw that the love interest would be an Elf King known to the outside world as ruthless and evil . . . I expected someone more dark, mysterious and wicked, but instead there was nothing at all interesting about him. I could care less about the guy.ahahaha and the romance?!?! I never thought the day would come when I'd find another book with a romance I'd be bored with. I expected some amazing chemistry between the two, but NO, THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.😤 Where was the angst??? Swoony moments??? I wanted to fall in love.😭 All I saw was the two constantly arguing over the most boring topics known to humanity.“You will respect me!” Eldas shouts. “Be someone worthy of respecting first!” I slam the door behind me.”^Okay, this scene here . . . it totally reminded me of my 4 and 5 year old sisters arguments I literally just pictured those two, when I was reading this scene and I couldn't stop laughing. I swear, I couldn't take these two 'adults' seriouslyAlso, you know how almost always with romance novels, when you're nearing the end and the two characters were together and in love, but then something happens to change that and get them in a fight, however by the end they realize they're hopelessly in love and get back together again? wow, my English teacher would be horrified with this run-on sentence hahaWell, if you weren't confused by that super long sentence, with this book—the beginning of that argument had to be one of the most stupidest I've ever heard in my life. It's so stupid that I couldn't help but start laughing over the fight they were having. Why does Eldas get so mad over Luella not telling him about Harrow's addiction to glimmer/what he does??? Luella even tried explaining to him, but he kept. cutting. her. off. She's a healer and one of her jobs is to also respect the patient's secrets or else they wouldn't be more trusting towards them and who knows what would've happened to Harrow if he hadn't trusted Luella with what he was doing??? *sigh* (Probably the only amusing part in this book)In the end, if I had to choose a character that I actually liked, it'd be Harrow and that is hilarious considering how in this status update, the someone I was referring to was him. But at least he was actually pretty interesting, although he obviously didn't appear as much.I think this was a hyped up a lot, so I had a super high expectations and when that was not met . . . well, it was super meh. I can say that I've never been so relieved to finish a book.I'm still looking forward to the next book, especially since it's about a a rogue Fae (altho this time I won't have my expectations so high)."May tomorrow hold every possibility. And may we be bold and hungry enough to take them for our own.” now that I look at this too, I realize how funny it sounds. oh god, i can't stop laughing now-(1.5⭐) --> for the good laughs it gave me
