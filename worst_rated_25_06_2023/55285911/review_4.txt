There’s a reason why they call Holly Black the Queen of Faerie. I have yet to find something that comes even close to Holly Black’s faeries, especially as in her Folk of the Air series.A Deal with the Elf King is a light fluffy romance trying to be fantasy, and not even trying hard. The only Elvish characteristics were in the name, The Elf King. It was easy to mistake all the characters for nothing more than human and easy to mistake the entire book for contemporary. Character features and dress were rarely described and it was near impossible for me to draw up a mental picture of them. I didn’t feel anything, I couldn’t feel the glittering magic of the Elf/Fae realm. I couldn’t feel the danger of it. I couldn’t feel the mystery of it. I didn’t feel the magic! And the Elf King did not fascinate me. Did not captivate me. He was basic. Dull. Too human. I didn’t see him as an Elvish creature at all. He...he fries up bacon and eggs. And bored me even more than that. This is definitely not dark, sinister and heavy. Which is obviously my thing. So if that’s youre thing too, and you’d rather pass on the “No, I love you more, schmoopy poops/But, I love you most, sugar toots”, I’d recommend White Stag by Kara Barbieri.And if you’re looking for another Goblin/Elf/Faerie arranged marriage trope check out: Radiance Elves, Faeries, Goblin Kings and arranged or forced marriage is what’s getting me through 2020 🙌🏼
