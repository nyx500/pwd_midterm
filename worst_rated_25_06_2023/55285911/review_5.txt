Stealing this review space to add a note or two about the book...This book was a passion project for me. It was my first book back writing again after being near burn-out. And I started drafting it at the beginning of quarantine in 2020. I wanted to write a world that I could escape into... where everything was wrapped up with a happily ever after at the end. It's my earnest hope that others can find an escape in the pages of Eldas and Luella.Some housekeeping/Book FAQ...You can see all retailer links on my website: https://elisekova.com/a-deal-with-the...Also on that page there is an exclusive, free sample of chapters 1-3 and a bonus scene that takes place after the end of the book.A DEAL WITH THE ELF KING is a stand alone, fantasy romance. It sits right on the cusp of older YA and adult. There is some steam in the book. It's set in the Married to Magic universe.Married to Magic is a universe I hope to write other stand alones in. These books can be read in any order and are each a complete story with no over-arching plotlines between them.The cover illustrator was Marcela Medeiros.
