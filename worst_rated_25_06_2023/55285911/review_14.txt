Because this is a standalone, it didn't feel as "epic" as most high fantasy novels. There wasn't a "big bad guy" and there wasn't a crazy plot twist/cliffhanger at the end. Instead, it was a very easy and straightforward read with a HEA ending. This isn't necessarily a good or bad thing, I just think it's good to set your expectations before you read.‚ùå I JUST COULDN'T CONNECT with Luella as much as I wanted to. It's hard to explain... even though the book was written in the first person, to me, it almost felt like I was reading it in the third person. Idk.‚úÖ THE ONLY THING I LIKED about Luella was her drive. I loved how she wasn't willing to just accept a shitty situation like so many other fantasy heroines. Instead, she took matters into her own hands and actually tried to fix the problemüÜó THE ROMANCE STEAM LEVEL was more than Elise typically has but not much compared to true romance novels. The slow burn was enjoyable. But overall, the romance didn't make me "feel" anything. Like... if there was not a HEA ending, I don't think I would have been too devastated‚ùå LUELLA AND ELDAS weren't willing to admit their feelings for each other, which resulted in a lot of drama near the end that I could have done without‚úÖ THE WORLD BUILDING and the concept of "Human Queens" was really cool. The world of Midscape was a big mystery at first, but throughout the novel, we slowly learned more about the world and unravelled the mystery behind the seasonsOverall, I would recommend this if you're looking for a light/easy read and I'll be reading the other standalone novels in this series.
