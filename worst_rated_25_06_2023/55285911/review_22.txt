Thank you so much to the author for sending me an ARC!This book was just pure fun. It has all of the tropes I love, with Hades & Persephone vibes, and even a hint of Beauty and the Beast. The world was fascinating, and I'm really excited to see more of it in later books (technically this is a standalone, but we'll be getting other books in this world with different characters!). The world includes almost every major type of magical creature you would want to see, and while we only got to touch on a small part of it, I really liked Elise Kova's versions of these creatures and can't wait to see the rest!Our two main characters (Luella and Eldas) are interesting and well-developed. I especially loved Luella as a character. I feel like there's a certain type of heroine we've come to expect from these types of books, but she surprised me constantly and I admired her dedication and strength. While A Deal with the Elf King isn't perfect- there were some sections where there wasn't much going on in the plot, and I feel like some of the side characters could use more depth-, I still couldn't break myself away from it. It was exactly the lighthearted fantasy romance I needed, and helped break me from a months-long reading slump!
