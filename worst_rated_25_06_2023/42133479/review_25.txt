Overall I enjoyed the story, the setting, and the main characters, but I felt like we didn’t get enough introduction into the antagonists so that when the final scene arrived and everyone came together, I couldn’t remember or got confused with who was who at times. I also felt like this could have been a little shorter, but I still liked it!
