Thank you so much to Penguin Random House for the review copy!TW: gore, violence, death, death of a loved one, depictions of seizures, absent parents.This was so much fun. Some of my favourite things about the book:- the atmospheric, Korean setting- the fact that the love interest was the PUREST cinnamon roll to ever exist- the beautiful relationship between Jihoon and his grandmother <3- the Korean mythology (Gumiho and Goblin galore!)If you love K-dramas, I would highly recommend picking this up!
