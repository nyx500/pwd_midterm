A gripping quest fantasy, set in a very well-constructed and richly layered world, led by characters I loved. I didn't realise quite how much I was craving a doorstopper that wasn't at all focused on romance. You can see Victoria Aveyard is sowing the seeds for some really compelling relationships, but to have this first instalment be primarily about the adventure, the friendships â€“ it was refreshing, and appreciated.
