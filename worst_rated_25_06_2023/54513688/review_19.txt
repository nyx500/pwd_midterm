i’m giving this a 3.5/5 because while this book was definitely good, it was just waaay too long. there is soooo much world building which is understandable because it’s the first book in a fantasy series, but i would’ve enjoyed more plot overall. HOWEVER, i really didn’t care for some of the POV’s, but most of the characters had me so interested that i genuinely couldn’t put the book down. Sorasa, Corayne, and Dom….yeah i would lay down my life for those three and those three only. i’m excited to see where the rest of the series goes and i hope that the next few books delivers more on plot now that the world building is out of the way!!! fingers crossed cus i’m rooting for u miss aveyard
