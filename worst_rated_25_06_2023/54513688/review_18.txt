There’s a lot I liked about this book, such as, the characters and the world. I found each POV interesting to read form and I enjoyed the perspective of each character. The world was really easy to understand (for me anyway) and I loved it. This book had a lot of potential to be really good and a great start to a new fantasy series, however, I feel the pacing and lack of action is it’s major downfall. While there was some elements of action scenes etc. It was just a bit too brief and the ending was slightly anticlimactic. I do think book two in the series will be much better now that everything has been set up, so I will be reading that and continuing. Since I adored the characters so much, that’s why the slow pacing and lack of action wasn’t a huge issue for me. Also love the idea of a villain romance in book two!
