'we are all monsters, nadya. some of us just hide it better than others.'this book is so seductively dark and holy, so gothically bloody, so cruelly romantic; and my black soul has never been happier. ðŸ–¤the strength of this story is the magic, the ferocious yet satisfying magic. hands down. the characters are brutally intense and beautifully developed, but its how magic affects them and their world that is so captivating. the entire plot is driven by the opposing beliefs about the nature of magic and i thought emily duncan did a great job at bringing that struggling debate to life. its impressively well thought-out and a real high point to the story.i will admit this isnt without faults. the romance is a very insta-lovey and the writing can get confusing/muddled at times, but there is such a strong foundation here that i know great things can be expected from the future installments of this series. also, the physical aesthetic of this book is so drop dead gorgeous, it makes me want to cry. the incandesce foil artwork, the colour tones, the spine, and overall design is just so much, i cant stop looking at it. this gets 5 stars for that alone! â†  4.5 stars
