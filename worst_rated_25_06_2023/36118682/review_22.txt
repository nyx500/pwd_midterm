3 stars bring me my place at minority station for not being one of the biggest fans of this book!I truly like a well written YA fantasy books. I try as hard as I could to pick the best ones because there is too much competition between the last releases. I hardly read this one, don’t get me wrong the development of the story and dynamics were good! Interestingly this book’s villains are likable especially the vultures were memorable.But mostly I didn’t relate with characters, there was something missing about their background stories. We have a cleric, who is able to talk to Gods: here is our Nadia. She is eager to bring back Gods to Tranavia! She is not my ideal and the bravest heroine. This problem is not about her flaws or weaknesses,mostly she has some understanding issues about how to carry her burdens and responsibilities of her powers. The other narrator of the story is Prince of Tranavia, also blood mage, Serefin. He has real father issues and it seems like his real purpose is getting drunk all the time!!!Supporting characters should start with charismatic Malachiasz, fights to stop the war but he also has different plans on his mind.And two tormented characters, Rashid and Parijahan are talented warriors with secrets( I’m not sure how their secrecy serves for bigger picture)So many questions weren’t answered about the Gods’ real definitions, their real purposes and divinity.This story has too many potentials but lack of characters’ development, blank points made me lost and kept me in the dark. Maybe I had too much expectations or I was not patient enough to connect with characters but in my opinion something is missing for me! So I may pass the second book of the series.
