4.5/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf 🐺I don't know what's going on with this book but I'M LOVING IT.I didn’t know what exactly was I expecting from this book because I was more curious than expectant, but it made me so happy that I picked it up, read it and enjoyed it that all I can say is that from now on I’m a fan.“Don’t be a martyr. We have no use for yet another saint.”As a Christian Orthodox, I can say that this gave me the exact same vibe that I get when I enter an old Orthodox church and all the saints on the walls are staring down at me and the smell of burned incense overwhelms me. I know, not entirely comfortable, but still an intense feeling.Kalyazin is the perfect picture of a pagan Russia, with its old beliefs, its rigid religious culture, its faith beyond compare. Tranavia is inspired by the Polish warrior spirit, the one that doesn’t fight for the likes of other beings but for its own power and good. It controls its own magic, the magic that exists in its blood.As a Slavic culture lover, I can say that I loved all the interesting schemes the author has pulled for constructing her world.“How does a human girl become something divine and feared by the gods that gave her the power she wields?”This is the story of Nadezhda Lapteva, which my Romanian-speaking ass automatically translates to “Hope Milkova” and I literally cannot think of her otherwise and I get the constant need to LOL when I see her name (because, you know, in Romanian, we have a word that sounds like Nadezhda and that is “nădejde” which roughly translates to “hope” and “lapte” means “milk” and I just can’t). Nadya’s relationship with Malachiasz is one of the strangest things I’ve come across in my readings. I wouldn’t necessarily call that a toxic relationship, but the way it manifests is just strange. To me.Nadya is the light in Malachiasz’s life, but Malachiasz is so darkened by his past that he fills sometimes Nadya up with his shadows. They love each other until the verge of hate, toeing that thin line between the two strong emotions, sometimes crossing it from one side to the other.“He turned and grinned at her, monstrous but beatific, holding out his hand, darkness gone. (…) She took his hand.”What kind of inner desires must one have to love the person you hate the most is beyond my power of comprehension, but as I read on I hope I will find my answer.One more cool aspect I’d like to discuss is the diversity of gods brought up into the story. There are so many of them and this makes the read so much more interesting. Let me exemplify it to you – we have:- Marzenya – the goddess of death, magic and winter. Her real-life Slavic equivalent being- Marena (or Baba Yaga, for the ones like me who know about her winks);- Zbyhneuska – the goddess of health;- Zvonimira – the goddess of light;- Krsnik – the god of fire. His Slavic equivalent being Kresnik;- Bozetjeh – the god of wind. His Slavic equivalent might be Stribog;The list goes on and its point is to show you how far the whole Slavic culture is explored and presented in this book. There are even several word and phrases in it that are supposedly in Kalyazi and Tranavian languages, but they resemble so much the Slavic languages they took inspiration from.(Or let's remember the cute term of endearment Malachiasz has for Nadya, “towy dżimyka”, that sounds so pretty and I wish someone would call me that because it is that pretty and I am that needy).Okay. With all that being said, my questions remain: would you try to read this book purely out of academic curiosity? Is it still not good enough for YA Fantasy world? Would Nadya’s heretical journey intrigue you in order to discover its inner power?“Is she powerful enough to take the stars out of the sky?”
