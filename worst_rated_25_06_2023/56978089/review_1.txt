the element that really sells this story is the magic in the ancient chinese art of tea brewing. i loved how everything in this book revolves around tea - it connects the characters through magic bonds, it provides the MC with a way to help her family through a competition, and it serves as the opposition as tea is being poisoned. tea is the life and heart of this novel. it was very cool to not only read about ancient chinese customs around tea making, but also traditional chinese medicine. the thing that prevented me from going “oh, i quite liked this” to “i loved this” is how formulaic the story is. i guess for a debut, i really shouldnt be so critical of the narrative structure because its not terrible, but because this follows the set-up of any basic YA fantasy, i never really felt like the stakes were high or got super emotionally invested in the story/characters.but overall, a more than decent beginning to a magically rich story/series!↠ 3.5 stars
