I didn't realize this was a snow white retelling, so I guess I read two books doing fairy tale retellings in a row. Lorelai is on the run, hiding out from her aunt Irina who uses her magic to control Revenspire and sit on the thrown that rightly belongs to Lorelai. It took me about a third of the book to get into the book, the book is YA and I guess I've gotten all old and sad and can't appreciate things as much so for the whole first third I was just like what is this writing. I did eventually get into it and it wasn't too bad. Its just an average YA book in my opinion. It's not particularly bad but I wasn't impressed either or in love with it. Wish there wasn't so much just telling and that there was some subtlety in the book, I don't think anything about YA books makes it so you can't do that.
