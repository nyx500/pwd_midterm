I thoroughly enjoyed this book! For all the reviews that claimed that it lacked originality...I don’t know about you, but I haven’t come across many Snow White retellings which included dragon-shapeshifters and telepathic gyrfalcons! I also really enjoyed the Russian influences, even though the names were a bit much at times. The incantors, or spells, were really interesting, too. There was even a list of them in the back of the book, which I really appreciated. Lorelai was an admirable and courageous princess with a talent for strategy, very much like Kestrel from the Winner’s Curse trilogy. Kol was an honourable king who sought to do the right thing. Together, they made a very sweet pair. I’m a sucker for retellings, so I don’t really have any complaints, except that I wish it had been a tad longer...mainly because I’ll miss these characters. I can’t wait to start the next book! :)
