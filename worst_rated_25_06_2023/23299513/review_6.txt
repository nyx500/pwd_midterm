I can't decide whether I was impressed or disappointed by this book. I loved the concepts and the world, and it reminded me a lot of the show Once Upon a Time and Snow White and The Huntsman, but I felt really indifferent towards the main character, Lorelai.I simply did not particularly like or care for her. I actually found her to be super condescending and I don't even think she realized it. She was constantly saying, "Oh, I'm the queen of Ravenspire. I'm the most powerful mardushka in the land. Blah blah blah." We get that you're the most powerful mardushka and all but it wouldn't hurt to humble yourself even just a little. It got to the point where I just got annoyed by her and couldn't take anything she said or did seriously.On top of that, the romance was just so cringeworthy. It felt so AWKWARD, and Kol and Lorelai had ZERO chemistry. Their dialogue was so cheesy and unoriginal. They were, by far, the most boring couple I've ever had to endure in a book. I loved Kol as a character and I loved the dragon concepts that were in The Shadow Queen, but the romance in this book made me shudder. In fact, I think Viktor and Irina's relationship, was far more intriguing than that of Kol and Lorelai's. I would have rather read an origin story about the Evil Queen and her loyal lover.Overall, I thought The Shadow Queen was really SLOW and SUPER DRAGGED ON. There were definitely a good amount of action scenes but even then, the story still felt dull and boring to me. It took me awhile to get through it because it just put me in a reading slump. Nothing in this book really excited me and I wasn't exactly dying to find out what happens next. The Shadow Queen didn't really leave a lasting impression on me and it definitely didn't land on list of top retellings.I'm a huge fan of everything Disney and retellings and I can see people liking this book, but this one just didn't work out for me.
