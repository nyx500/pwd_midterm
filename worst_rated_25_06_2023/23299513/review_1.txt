This is a book about a girl who should be queen, rounding up her band of outsiders to reclaim her stolen kingdom with some magical help. Oh wait a second, haven’t we heard this one before? Oh yeah! Maybe I’m mistaken, but it sounds like the plot of about 80% of YA fantasy novels.I read 5 chapters of The Shadow Queen before going to sleep the other night and I woke up the next day and couldn’t remember what book I was in. All the characters were mixed up in my head with those from every other YA fantasy and fairy tale retelling. I had to read back through the first 5 chapters to remind myself.It's not even that there's anything to hate or make you angry about this book. It’s simply one of the most emotionless, forgettable books I’ve read in a long time. There is literally nothing to distinguish it from this completely saturated genre. Yet another one to add to the ever-growing generic pile.From start to finish (yes, I forced myself through!), I couldn't shake the feeling that the author wrote this book with a checklist in mind. It’s like the author set out with an agenda - the intention of delivering every trope that’s been a proved seller in the past.Generic heroine wants to reclaim kingdom... check.Generic band of friends assisting her in reclaiming kingdom... check.Generic prince... check.Generic (i.e. non-existent) world-building... check.Generic mindless action... check.Any attempts to add detail are vague and messy. So far, just in this first volume, we've come across mardushkas (magic-wielders), dragon shapeshifters, ogres and mentions of the fae. None of these are developed very well, they're just a random bunch of supernatural whatever to stir into the pot.You might have noticed that I haven't bothered with a plot summary. Well, just imagine the basic plot of Snow White and then form it into the generic outline of YA fantasy novels... you've pretty much got it.Hell, this was so boring.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest
