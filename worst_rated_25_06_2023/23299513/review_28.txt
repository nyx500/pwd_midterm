THE REVIEWWhy this book?This seemed like a book for meWhat I thoughtI enjoyed the authorâ€™s twist on the Snow White retelling. I also really liked the characters especially Kol I have a soft spot for dragon shape shifters. There's also not alot of characters so each one is important to the story. There's a bit of romance,plenty of action and some great banter. I loved the whole fairytale feel of this book with kings , queens, princesses, princes, dragons and Ogres etc. It made a great fantasy book.With plenty twists an turns I absolutely loved this and highly recommend it!
