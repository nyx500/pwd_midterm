Normally I avoid fairy tale re-tellings because I already know the story and how it ends. And I'm sure I'm missing lots of great stories due to this mistaken belief. I plan to change my attitude...er...now :) When my editor sent me The Shadow Queen and ask me to read it for a potential blurb - my first thought was cool cover! And it wasn't until I started reading the book that I realized it had a few things in common with the story of Snow White - those things are poisoned apples, an evil queen, and a huntsman - otherwise, it's it own story.I really loved the characters - especially the main protagonist, Lorelai and her brother Leo. They're on the run from the evil queen who is a powerful magician. However every time she used her magic, she drains the life from the land. Lorelai wishes to restore the land and claim the throne (her father was the king). The huntsman I mentioned also happens to be able to turn into a dragon, which is a nice little twist on the fable and his kingdom is being overrun with ogres, which is why he's tricked into helping the evil queen.This is a great fantasy story that keeps the action moving. Here's my quote for the cover: "With poison, fire, and deadly deeds, this tale is hard to put down and even harder to forget. Iâ€™ll never look at apples the same way again!"
