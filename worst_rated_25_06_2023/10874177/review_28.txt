Well, that was fun. My Kindle continues to provide a comfortable if not elegant reading experience, and, of course, tremendous convenience for odd-hours shopping.It was amusing to recognize younger versions of some of the characters met in the (written earlier, set later, adult-marketed) Parasol Protectorate series. I imagine that would also work in reverse fairly well. The downshift to the YA length and somewhat underwritten style did not affect the general goofiness of the setup, though it did give me a sense of too much action, not enough of everything else. I would be curious to know what the age-target audience made of it all. This one would probably also make the transition to manga easily.It will be interesting to see how it all develops when the greater length of the apparently planned series gives room for it.Ta, L.
