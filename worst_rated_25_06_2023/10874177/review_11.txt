Hummm..... well I sort of hesitated on the rating for this one. I mean I don't think I'll be reading the rest of the series, at least not right away, but I did enjoy the book....mostly.What we have here is a young woman in an alternate England of lords and ladies with very proper etiquette, not to mention stiff collars and lots of frills. Sadly 14 year old Sophronia does not fit in. She put me in mind of the song from The Sound of Music:http://www.rnh.com/videos.html?video=...She is a great trial to her mother, especially since her sister is a very, very proper young woman. Happily for mom she finds a Finishing School that seems willing to take Sophronia in spite of...short comings.As you may have intuited this is not your "run of the mill" Finishing School.The book tells a good story, that said it's long on characters and very short on plot. We spend a LOT of time getting to know the school and the world. The plot is sort of fitted in between Sophronia's revelations and education. It's introduced early on during the trip to the School but then like a sort of literary prairie dog it ducks back below ground popping up at various times throughout the book, finally making a slightly climactic appearance as the book ties up and opens the way for the next volume.There's nothing really new in that or in the story. It is however fun with interesting characters and lots of humor (or at least attempts at humor).Could I...I'd go with the ever popular 3.5 but lacking that I'll go 4. It will probably appeal to a female and teen audiance somewhat more that others as that seems to be the "target audience" but it's a fun book and I can recommend it as a light read.
