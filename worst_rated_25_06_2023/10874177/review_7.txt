Etiquette & Espionage by Gail Carriger1st book in the Finishing School series. 1st in the timeline of all series per author list online. YA historical steampunk. Fourteen-year old Sophronia is sent to finishing school to be a lady. She’s learning proper diversion, deceit, espionage and the poisons to use in different circumstances. And how to curtsy of course Sophronia is a curious girl and is soon climbing through hatches on the floating ship, and getting into mischief on ever deck.Fun and imaginative. Lots of intriguing mechanicals including a pet dog that feeds on coal. I can’t wait to read the rest of this series.
