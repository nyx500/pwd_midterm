*I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review from the publisher (macmillan)**This does not affect my views or opinions*  To start off with, the writing was wonderful. It was so well written, it flowed so well, was descriptive, but not overly so.  The pacing was spot on, and the world building was wonderful. The characters were all well developed too, and I liked them and had interest in whether or not they survived from pretty early on in the book.However, the thing is, it all felt familiar. The characters all felt like ones I'd met before, and the story felt like one I'd already read many times. The general feel of the book was very stereotypical of a YA fantasy, and had elements that I've read in a lot of other YA fantasy. There just wasn't really anything unique or different about this particular book. The Magic system was the only thing that had slight difference, but it wasn't enough to make this book unique, or make it stand out from all the other YA fantasies out there.Hopefully the story will develop more, and become more unique in the following books, because I really enjoyed the writing, but unfortunately, the plot was just too samey for me to rate it any higher than I have.Rating breakdown: Plot: 2/5Characters: 4/5Writing: 4.5/5
