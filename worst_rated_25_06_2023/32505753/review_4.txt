2022 - My reread or relisten took this from 5 to 3 stars. I’m going to unhaul my hardbacks and keep the kindle editions I bought in a kindle sale (this is part of my "unhaul my life" that I’ve decided to do over time with all of my things) Although, I’m unhauling kindle books too. I’ll reread the next two books as well. Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
