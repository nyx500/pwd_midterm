“I was a princess made of ashes; there is nothing left of me to burn.Now it's time for a queen to rise.”★・・・・・・★・・・・・・★・・・・・・★・・・・・・★A great surprise!I didn’t expect much from Ash Princess when I bought it for 99 cents a couple of weeks ago. So I am all the more pleased to be able to say that I really liked it.The story itself is not very imaginative, but I think the character development during the course of the book is very well done. At first glance, princess Theodosia Eirene Houzzara is like any other female protagonist; stubborn, strong-willed, a bit annoying and unaware of the fact that she's, guess what, The Chosen One.But the more you read, the more you realize that she actually has some depth and a very good and realistic personality. Theo is clever, shows compassion when others do not and actually has a guilty conscience over betraying someone she likes, even if this person is an enemy of her and her people. She also doesn't jump the gun when dealing with decisions affecting the lives of others, especially those of innocent Kalovaxians (which, at the end of the day, are still her enemies). A quality a good queen needs.All in all, the characters were very well written in my opinion, the only exception being Blaise. I really can't stand his guts. He reminds me a lot of Gale Hawthorne from The Hunger Games - another guy I'd like to push down a cliff. I'm not going into too much detail because the ranting wouldn't stop, but let me just tell you that he's nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to Søren or my precious litte buttercup Heron. Oh, Heron. I really hope you get the happy ending you so much deserve.Anyways, I'm really hooked now and can't wait to continue with this series! Give it a shot and let me know if you've enjoyed it as much as I did.Thanks for reading, lovelies!★・・・・・・★・・・・・・★・・・・・・★・・・・・・★
