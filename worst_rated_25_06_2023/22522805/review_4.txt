1 star - I don't often feel guilty at not being able to finish a book, but I do this time. It's not like I didn't try. I made three attempts to read it. 1. I got the book. I read a few chapters. The characters didn't have any personalities, the descriptions of them didn't bring them to life at all and I wasn't enamoured of the setting either. So I gave it up.2. Tried the audio book. Was it going to be any better listening to the story paper-dry protagonists and their fantasy quest. No. My mind kept blanking out and thinking important thoughts like did I add "kitchen paper" to the shopping list or did I specify that nice soft Viva one? Stuff like that.3. Last attempt, I got the BBC abridged version. Well, I thought, I'm bound to be able to make it through only 2.5 hours of prose that concentrates on the essence of the book. Failed.It wasn't just that the characters never seemed to be anyone, it was that I kept thinking they were symbols for something and that is why a master author, as Ishiguro certainly is, had written them in such a flat way. But symbols for who or what? I never worked it out. All I got from the book was it was repetitious which made it tedious and not only were the characters forgetting everything, so was I. It never held my attention. So finally, I gave it up. And I feel guilty. Maybe if I'd made it to the end, I would have found it a brilliant piece of writing with endless golden vistas of revelations that slowly appear, delighting with each new and surprising element. But I'll never know, I couldn't wait that long, couldn't get to that point. Tedium overtook me and whispered in my ear 'lots of books on the to-be-read list' and I gave in and gave up.
