I refuse to put myself in a position where the likelihood of myself being triggered is high. I don't think the "kill marks" which feature in this book are okay. My friend Cait talks more about how they these marks can be connected to self harm. I was curious about this book but after hearing several quotes which feature in the book about these marks I am physically sick and disgusted. It honestly saddens me. I wonder how such a thing passed by so many ARC readers though. The cover itself is a representation of self harm. Something that people also need to be aware of. It is not simply a wall with gold paint. Please proceed with caution if you choose to read this book despite the triggers present. Stay safe. As soon as you feel even slightly triggered, put the book down. Your mental health and physical well being is more important than this story. Please be careful, you're all too important.On top of all this, there are racist stereotypes and ableist attitudes all throughout this book. Something which shouldn't be supported at all, in my opinion. Also, to tell people their opinion about the racism, ableism and triggers which feature in this book is invalid or wrong is highly ignorant behaviour . You are allowed to enjoy this book, but stay away of the problems that do feature and stay open to others opinions, especially those who have been harmed by this novel.For more information on the ableism, which is primarily about chronic pain because described as a gift, read Emer's review. She suffers from chronic pain and talks about her views on the topic.
