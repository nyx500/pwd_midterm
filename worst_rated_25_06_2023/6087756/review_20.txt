I had low expectation about this book because urban fantasy could be hard for me to get into. Besides, it’s not encouraging that the book is in a male voice by a female author. Therefore, I had only intended to take a look at the first page. However, first page turned into second page and so forth. I couldn’t put it down. All the while I was reading, I kept trying to stop and switch to the book I had in mind. Well, I never did. And here I am, eager to finish the whole series.It's surprising how real and likable the male voice, Cassel, is. You'd never mistake him as a girl. Cassel is a con artist with a conscience. At 17, he has a terrible past and has gone through quite some hardship. He struggles to find his place but never wallows in self-pity. Instead, he meets the challenges head on without getting overly sentimental. There's a sense of humor even in a really bad situation. He has that vulnerability and self-depreciation to make you root for him, and to see him out-smart powerful adversaries is such a satisfying feeling. The book has the obvious Sopranos vibe going on but it's mostly within YA range. And the mystery! It's fascinating to connect the dots. Clues are dropped here and there, while the world-building is effortlessly weaved into the story. There's never long passages of info dumping, which is quite impressive given how detailed and creative this magical world is. Though this book may not be a heady emotional ride that tugs at your heartstrings, it is nonetheless a cleverly written, engrossing story with rich world-building and likable characters. I'll definitely continue with the series.
