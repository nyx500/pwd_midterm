Holly Black usually specializes in this mix of fantasy, young adult blend that works for her exceedingly well and seems to be very popular, nowadays. Here, in White Cat she has this alternate history (acceptance of witch culture), science fiction, urban fantasy, YA mashup that I enjoyed quite a bit. Cassel is the youngest member of a magic family of con artists that exist for the grift. Everyone in his family has magic abilities that help their cons, but he doesn't have powers. As the weakest member, and because he killed his best friend, he is constantly protected by his two older siblings. Lately, he has been sleepwalking and he soon realizes that instead of protecting him, his brothers may in fact be conning him. Because of certain clues, he has decided to get to the bottom of the secrets that lie buried in his past, and in order to do that, he must now con the curse workers in his family. Wow. I really did not know what to expect, but this was a unique bit of Fantasy, Alternate History, YA that has plot twists galore. I thought it was going one way, and boy was I wrong. When that happens, tip your cap.
