✅ Magic / Powers✅ Intrigue ✅ Betrayal🆗✅ Characters and relationships 🆗✅ Pace In this series, workers are ordinary people with extraordinary abilities. They look like anyone else, but one contact from their bare hand, and they can control your emotions, your dreams, bring you luck or bad luck, hurt you, kill you or even transform you into something else entirely. This story is full of lies and betrayals, and poos Cassel has no idea who wants to help him, and who wants to take advantage of him or use him. “He's the kind of liar who totally forgets what he told you the last time, but he believes every single lie with such conviction that sometimes he can convince you of it.”It was different for me to read a story where the main character is a young boy and I liked the way Holly Black made me feel in a boy’s head, yet there were emotions, uncertainty, and everything that comes with being a non-gifted teenager in a family of gifted people. Cassel is from a family of curse workers and he is the only one without an ability. Still, he is cunning and clever and makes it up by being a good con artist that people tend to underestimate. That is until he starts to realize that things are not what they seem and that he can't even trust his own family or his memories.“I can't trust the people I care about not to hurt me. And I'm not sure I can trust myself not to hurt them, either.”Cassel's family is so messed up, but I loved it! He can't trust them (even if he wants to), and they are ruthless enough for him to be wary and on his guard with his own mother and brothers.The intrigue in this book is wonderfully presented. We can't really see the big picture until it is revealed at the end. It had me hooked up from the beginning until the end. I admit that I am not in a big rush to read Red Glove because there is no big cliffhanger at the end of White Cat, but I will definitely read it in the near future.Follow me on Instagram 🙂
