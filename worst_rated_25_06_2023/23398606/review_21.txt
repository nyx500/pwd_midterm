I would probably have never read this but it was suggested for a Challenge ( thanks Teneal) and I have to say I liked it! It is quite a remarkable book actually and Alice in Wonderland will never look the same again. In this rewrite Alice has been placed in an insane asylum due to her belief that she went down a rabbit hole and met a talking rabbit. From there we descend into what is really a horror story as Alice meets again the Rabbit, the Walrus, Cheshire and others only in quite different forms from the original. There is a lot of blood, violence and rape so it is definitely not a fairy story.I enjoyed this reinterpretation and intend to read the next book as well:)
