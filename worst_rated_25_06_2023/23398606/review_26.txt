Alice as retold that she had returned from her trip to wonderland with stories that were taken as nonsensical babbling by her family who; being well-To-do, decided to just lock her away.Ten years later a fire starts at the asylum, leading Alice to escape and journey to the ‘old world’ which is heavily shadowed by four sex slavery king pins with distasteful and unforgivable fetishesI turned on spoilersHere’s some space just in caseI might have done it wrongSpoilersAlthough I thoroughly enjoyed following the adventures of Alice and Hatcher, it seemed that as the beginning was stretched and slower than necessary, the ending seemed rushed and wasn’t overall satisfying.

Why have her committed?
