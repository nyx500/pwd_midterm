Sigh . . . After Beauty, McKinley should've left the Beauty and the Beast fairytale alone and not revisit it just to shoot herself in both feet with this second attempt at a retelling. Readers who observed the flaws and plotholes in Beauty will notice that Robin McKinley not only repeats the same mistakes but actually exacerbates them; they're much worse in this story. And the sad part is, this time the author can't be given the benefit of the doubt. With Beauty she was a fledgling author and so you could always be indulgent about her beginner mistakes. Some readers don't even take them into account and rate that book 5 stars. But with Rose Daughter? McKinley is a veteran author now, and should know better. Should've known better not just to NOT repeat the mistakes but also when to call it quits and reflect that if second parts are rarely good, second attempts never are. Not when your first one was good enough to not need a rehash.
