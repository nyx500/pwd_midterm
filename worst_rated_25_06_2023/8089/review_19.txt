I held my breath as I clicked the mouse, selecting this book for the library to "hold" for me. Did I really want to read another obvious fairy tale reworked? Granted, I had read "Beauty" numerous times, recommended it to everyone, purchased it for myself, and was certain it was what Disney based their animated feature around. And just last year I had braved the retelling of Sleeping Beauty as "Spindle's End" and was equally entranced.I had read alot of her other, young adult works of fiction throughout my childhood. I adored "The Blue Sword", "The Hero & the Crown", etc...But still... fairy tales don't sit well with me and it is rare that I am motivated to seek them out, moreso rare that I can be in the right frame of mind to read and enjoy them.After I'd reserved "Rose Daughter" for my reading, I did a quick search to see what the tale was about.No! Could it be?!The author herself had actually RE-WRITTEN my beloved "Beauty"?!Yes.Nearly 20 years after the fact.I was equally eager and abhorrent to read this reworking.Everything I read on the subject assured that it WAS, in fact, a "reworking" and not a complete retelling, not a drastic change, etc...All I can say is "Oh, wow!""Oh, man...!"
