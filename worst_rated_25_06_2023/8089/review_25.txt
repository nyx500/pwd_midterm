Ugh, Beauty is the better of the two re-tellings of Beauty and the Beast by McKinley, hands down. In this one, Beauty is just too dumb and one dimensional for words. All she wants to do is garden. Booooring. I say dumb, because before she and her family left the city, she went to all if her friends to learn how to do important stuff like make butter and cheese and can goods, important survival stuff when going from a city to the middle of a rural village. A magical salamander that is her friend offers to give her the gift of being able to remember everything her friends are telling her. She declines. What?!? She needs that information, it could be the difference between life and death for her and her family, yet she says "no thanks"? And I'm sorry, but her father drive all magic users out of town, but their next door neighbor is a retired sorcerer with a salamander as a familiar? How did that get past the editors? O, wait, never mind. There clearly weren't editors for this book. Don't get me wrong, I love Beauty, but McKinley should have stopped while she was ahead. The ending for this version blows too. *spoiler* The Beast doesn't change. Isn't that kinda the whole point to the story? Dude, it's literally Beastiality if she and he consummate their relationship. That is the height of nasty. Skip this one, read Beauty instead.
