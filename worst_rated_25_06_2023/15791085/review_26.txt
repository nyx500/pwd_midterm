7 out of 10Ревью в моем блоге/This review on my blog Living A Thousand Lives (please use Chrome/Yandex browser or Android/IOS to see the page; otherwise, spoiler-tags I use to make my post compact may not work) Short-Soundtrack:Skillet – Not Gonna DieStan Walker – Unbroken Zella Day – SacrificeGenre: historical-fantasy, steampunk, YAStuff: Fae, balls, ladies, gentlemen, 19 centuryFail: kinda depthlessWOW: funny-moments, male-leadsPOV: 1st-person, femaleSetting: Scotland (Edinburgh)Love-Geometry: lightQuote-Core:    "Time won't fix me."  My first steampunk. Did I like it? Definitely. Though the plot was a bit average: special girl saves the world, she’s training to kill evil creatures while being torturing by the memory of her mother’s murder and falling for her enemy. BUT! The execution is good. Also, it was a very fast read. Seeing as I’m new to the steampunk genre, let me admire the mix of old times, beautiful gowns, distinguished manners, and modern technologies. Metal spiders stitch your wounds, machines make your tea, a young lady creates an air vehicle… Too much? Not at all. All this stuff really suits the plot. I will continue my relationship with steampunk for sure. People say our MC Aileana is a murderer. Whom did she kill? Her mother. She was found next to her body two years ago, covered with blood. Back then Aileana said nothing and held her tears. That night in her hair was seilgflùr (a plant that helps mortals to see fairies). That’s why Aileana knows who’s a real killer and she’s going to get her revenge. For two years theMC has been crushing her enemy’s kin: to the left, to the right, through the length and breadth. How does she manage to do such a thing? Kiaran. He’s one of the highest Fae and he'd saved Aileana’s life a couple of years ago. After that, he became her hunter-partner (she doesn’t know his reasons) and now he's helping her to kill his own kind. I’m sure you have already guessed that this Fae-man is freaking awesome? Amethyst eyes, pitch-black hair, Apollo-like body, superpower within… Of course, I like Kiaran. With the passing of time, Aileana is getting used to her destiny and the danger she and the world are in. On days she leads her previous life with balls and tea-parties and other lady-like things, at nights she becomes a killer. It's hard to balance between two lives, but what choice does MC have?  Aileana has a pixie Derrick, who lives in her wardrobe. This tiny elf-like creature adores eating (or drinking?) honey and do some sewing. He's adorable, funny and cute and actually saved The Falconer to me. At the start of reading I always gave a story 10 stars and then, page after page, they goes out (if there are reasons for them to do so). When The Falconer was left with 6 stars only, I’ve read this:“When Dante described the circles of Hell, he clearly forgot the one where a hungry pixie sits on one's shoulder for eternity.”This:        ‘Daaaaaancing,’ Derrick cries. ‘I love daaaancing! Tell him to toss you over his head!’      And this:      "'Derrick giggles. ‘Whirling! I love to whirl. Ask him to whirl faster! I see lights. Do you see the lights? Aileana? Do you see the lights’"    And decided this book will end up with 7 starts and no less.Oh, I almost forgot about Gavin, the brother of Aileana’s bestfriend. She had a crush on him when she was younger but now she’s all about Kiaran. So believe me, there is no love-triangle (so faaar). Well, Gavin is a Seer; he's aware of fairies without any plants, that’s why his human energy is really tasty for these magical creatures. That's why we can't let him be, he's in need of protection and can be useful. Also, that's not so bad to have him around. He's handsome, smart has manners, and likes whisky (British men and tea? Nah, old-news).What to expect? A few chases, fights, and kinds of Fae; a couple of balls and awesome machines, a bunch of funny banters, one really hot kiss, a couple of swoon moments, and one epic-battle next to the end.The final… This part of the book assured me that I really have to give The Falconer 7 stars. The ending was promising and intriguing. I can smell the prequel would be better and can’t wait to have it for myself. The Falconer (Охотницы):— The Falconer (Охотницы) #1/3— The Vanishing Throne (Исчезающий трон) #2/3— The Fallen Kingdom (Павшее королевство) #3/3
