In contrast with her previous series (The Wrath and the Dawn) this book seems like more of the same. A girl out for revenge. A guy out to find/rescue her. She falls in love-ish with the enemy. There's a potential love triangle. She says she's strong but really she's not. The magic is rather lame. The scenes are described in minutiae to the point it's bothersome, detracting from the plot. Don't even get me started on the lame fight scenes, and then of course there's the dreaded cliffhanger. This is TWATD, deuxi√®me partie. That said, Ms Ahdieh certainly can write.
