It seems I hold the unpopular opinion in regards to this book. While all my friends complain, I’m sitting here like ???  it was epic, where were you???#1 First off, the fact that Renee wrote this book is an instant 10 point. She absolutely slayed me with The Wrath and the Dawn ((I love Khalid sm, my sweet child)) and while there are many parallels that can be linked between the two books, I found this one to have such a passionate charm. #2 The writing is absolutely magnificent. It’s colourful and exquisite and contains Japanese idioms that just really make it feel so so so so well developed. At first, I will admit, I found it hard to remember each and every character, since there were a lot introduced initially, but I got the hang of it and then I was burning through the book without a second thought.#3 CAN WE PLEASE STOP CALLING OUT MARIKO, I LOVE HER OKAY. #4 Okami is the love of my life. Okay, okay, I know the whole romance build up was kind of sudden but who the hell cares, its beautiful and intense and heated and just I loved it so much#5 I love how the story was build and developed over a long arc of time. We really got to see the character’s in their day-to-day lives #6 Kenshin was one of my favs in the beginning but then he was pissing me off left and right but then Amaya was introduced and I was like FRICKEN HELL I MUST. SHIP. #7 Lots of plot twists that had me like BOI EXPLAIN THIS IM GOING CRAZY WITH MY THEORIES #8 I thought the book was super bada*s and I loved the whole warrior thing and it was just awesome man. #9 I need book 2 right now please, Renee please its my last wish. #10 THE JAPANESE CULTURE IM SO ENCHANTED  “Be as swift as the wind. As silent as the forest. As fierce as the fire. As unshakable as the mountain. And you can do anything...” 4 stars!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i'm so fricken stoked for this book, honestly, if it disappoints i will end 2017 ((also i know NOTHING about mulan PUT YOUR PITCHFORKS DOWN im going to go research the hell out of it rn))  Buddy read  with the squad, Jia & Charlotte & Aaron & fake buddy reading with Prag & Amy
