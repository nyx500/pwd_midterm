2.5ish*This is a hard one to review for a few reasons. Namely, I have such mixed feelings. A lot of people were disappointed by this book because it was advertised as a Mulan retelling but it wasn't really a Mulan retelling, and while I see that complaint you can definitely see how it was Mulan inspired, which is what the author said it was. That aside, there were certain elements of this that I loved, especially the female empowerment, but the story as a whole was a bit of a let down. Truth is I was bored most of the time, I found it really hard to motivate myself to actually finish. I thought it was just me being too busy, but it took me 3 tries to actually get through it. So unfortunately, I don't see myself continuing with the series.
