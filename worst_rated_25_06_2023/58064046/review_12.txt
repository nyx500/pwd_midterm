Imagine giving a V.E. Schwab book a low rating… can’t be me. This book was SO good and I truly am in love with V. E. Schwab’s writing. They write like a painter creates Impressionism - eloquently and filled with striking, beautiful details. It’s impossible to not be blown away. The plot is slow for the larger part of the book but I personally don’t mind that as long as the main character is fully developed and intriguing (which Olivia is). Olivia Prior captured my heart and soul and I really love that even though she was mute, she still found a way to communicate with everyone around her. She didn’t just feel like words on paper and V.E. accomplishes that every time with her protagonists. The side characters (especially Matthew <3) were equally amazing, although I do wish we had more information about Hannah and Edgar. Anyway, I’d describe the plot as  The Secret Garden  meets  The Haunting of Hill House/ Bly Manor , so if you like either of those, I highly reccomend Gallant. Also, BIG shout out to Manuel Šumberac, the illustrator, because the illustrations were absolutely BEAUTIFUL. Seriously, I think this may be the prettiest book I own and that’s completely fine with me. The only con I have about this novel is that even though it’s a slow plot (which is fine), things really rushed at the end and left me a bit confused- it’s like 90% of the story is at one pace and the last 10% is going full speed. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this book and I will read every book that V.E Schwab writes as long as I read. *4.5 stars :)————————————- I have a signed first edition!!Not only did V.E. Schwab TOUCH this book, she SIGNED it. I am over the moon and this is now one of my prized possessions.
