This book is weird, as I was expecting it to be. The writing is just â€¦. ahh itâ€™s so nice. Itâ€™s not too purple or flowery, but still lyrical.I just picture Olivia as Wednesday Addams ðŸ˜‚ sheâ€™s literally described the same way!On the subject of Olivia, I think her mutism is a needed representation. Iâ€™ve read basically no books where the main character uses sign language to communicate. I am endlessly grateful that Oliviaâ€™s mutism wasnâ€™t magically cured by the end of the book, like it probably would have in the hands of a different author.My main gripe is with the overall structure. Yes, I know it is marketed as middle grade, but the author said it fits into multiple age ranges. This isnâ€™t really true. It feels very, very MG. This isnâ€™t bad, just not what I was led to believe.3.5 stars SPOILERS BELOW:Is Death supposed to be Luc? Iâ€™m just going to continue thinking that he is, idk what anyone says.
