Cinderella is a tired tale. It's been done. It's been redone. It's been re-redone.So, if I'm going to pick up (yet another) retelling, it really has to blow me away. I need to be wowed. My socks must be knocked off.Those socks remained firm. (Not even a twitch.)In this version, Ash (our Cinder) is raised by her (unsurprisingly) evil stepmother and her only joy is rereading fairytales next to the fireplace ashes (hence the name Ash (how clever)). She would rather be alone in her room than alone in the midst of a celebration she was not a part of.Just when her life is at the pinnacle of hopelessness and she's sinking into a deep depression, she meets Sidhean. He's a member of the fae - and promises to whisk her away to his lands.Soon he's all she can think of. Only his promises aren't what they seem and she's none the wiser. “Every time you come near me,” he said, “you come closer to the end of everything.”Then one day, Ash meets Kasia (the Queen's Huntress) and through their friendship (and eventually love) she finds the courage and hope to keep living. With her heart hammering in her throat, Ash asked, ‘Will you do me the honor of dancing with me?’ She looked up at Kaisa, and the huntress’ look of bewilderment was changing, slowly, to a small, tentative smile. I liked the idea of this one. The darker aspects of the tale, the menace of the fairies and the sweet romance between Ash and Kasia...only nothing really clicked for me. The characters felt flat,  their phrases alternated between wooden and cliche, and the romance was just too predictable. No spark.The strongest emotion I felt was just overwhelming boredom and exasperation. I lost time that I can never get back.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
