“Every time you come near me,” he said, “you come closer to the end of everything.”“It does not feel that way,” she said. “It feels like I am coming closer to the beginning.” The characters felt so flat and dull. I didn't care whatever happens to them. The plot was also predictable and slow, and there were no twists! The world wasn't developed well, I felt lost for the most part of it, but a part of it was because I skipped a lot of pages. Couldn't help it! I didn't buy the romance. I have no problem with it being a girl-to-girl romance, it's more on I didn't feel the connection. They were friends, then suddenly they're in love with each other. I didn't feel the "falling" part. All in all, I'm so disappointed that I didn't like it as much as I hoped I would. The promising premise was totally wasted for me, sorry.
