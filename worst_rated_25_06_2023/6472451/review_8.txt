This book was incredibly difficult to read because it was incredibly dry and slow-paced. It felt like nothing really happened until page 250, and the book is only 264 pages. This book can hardly be pitched as a sapphic romance because there is very little development of that before page 200, and they don't even kiss until 10 pages before the end. I was just so bored reading this and the romance element was drowned beneath a really confusing fairy plotline. There was little to no angst to keep me interested in the developing romance, and by the end, I found this book blandly average, even though I did like the Cinderella elements sprinkled in.
