I can’t lie I was disappointed when I picked this up and realised it wasn’t about Kaye! This ones about a girl called Val...who honestly I thought was just...boring, I didn’t like her or really connect with any of the characters in the book. Tbf this whole story was kind of just boring compared to the first one. It was enjoyable enough to get through but idk it was just slow and boring and not really all that exciting. The excessive drug use for most of the book wasn’t exactly great content either tbh...Hmmm 2.5 I’d say, just cos it kept me interested just enough to read the whole thing and I do like fae so I liked those elements atleast
