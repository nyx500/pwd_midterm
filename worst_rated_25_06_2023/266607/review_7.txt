I hated this book from the first page. Strong words, I know, but let's just have it out. Trite, lame and basically a waste of tree. The plot was blurg, the characters were frighteningly unenthralling, the writing was fair, but you can find decent writing on the back of a cereal box. The one book's one saving grace was a troll and though the idea was cool, it was hardly enough to save the entire horrible mess. To rant in depth, I have to start with the drug thing. Magic as a drug (seen it! and it was done better) is an interesting idea, but to depict it as being like heroin addiction seems to be pushing the line just to push the line. And that's the big problem I have with Black. Her characters, her plot, they're constructed like cheap, ugly whores. They have to wear a hellva lot of horrid make-up and will do just about anything to make a few bucks in order to pay their pimps. From the very beginning she's throwing in Jerry Springer-esque turns in what begins to feel like a tacky attempt to hook through shock. Okay, so street kids and drugs and people with piercings and dyed hair, yeah, I know how those things look cool. And being someone who has experience with all of the above, I can't say that I don't appreciate them. But underlying all of these "cool" things is generally such pain and insecurity that to write about them in the way that Black does is like covering a snake-infested swamp with a glittery plastic sheet and inviting your friends to go ice skating.People can write whatever crap they want, thankfully we don't have to read it.
