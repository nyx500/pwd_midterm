This story was much too disconcerting for me to thoroughly enjoy. To be frank, I think that I liked it better when Holly Black's Faerie stories were centred on the Seelie and Unseelie Courts. There was much more intrigue, and a sense of newness and discovering something unknown.The stories that are based in OUR world, aren't as strong. And the protagonists... are a bit more from the seedier side of life.This was true here. Val comes from a home of a single mum, and upon discovering a secret - instead of confronting the people involved - she runs away. What follows is some pretty graphic depictions of drug use, messed up morals of people (and Fae) trying to simply survive, and pretty out-of-left field declarations of love.The writing was solid, as it always is. The reveal was pretty good, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.
