Oh, oh my. The ending left me breathless. I loved this so much.Okay, so I'm going to keep this short and without a personal recap or summary. Let me tell you what I loved: the writing (lovely), the mystery + mythology, ER LANG AND ALL HIS SCENES, and pretty much the entire beginning, where Li Lan is thrust into the mystery of Tian Ching, what happened to him, and how she's going to get rid of his ghost. Unlike the tv show (not impressed, Netflix), Li Lan herself goes into a kind of coma and must figure out how to return to her living body. I did struggle with the middle portion of this book, but it didn't take away my love for the characters or the story. I think I missed some key information (my fault?), and I felt like I was wandering around in the dark more so than Li Lan herself.That's where I got lost. I couldn't figure out what all her goals were and why some of the stragglers we meet along the way mattered. I just wasn't following.BUT. Er Lang entered, and I'd already heard so much about him, so I had to keep reading. And oh, I am so glad I did. Once her goals became clearer and the mystery with Er Lang deepened, I was hooked. I loved everything about their interactions and banter.SoooOOooo if you love mystery, romance, beautiful prose and EXTREMELY satisfying endings, please pick up this gorgeous book. Legit, the last line gave me the best kind of chills. The best kind.Ps. Visit me on Instagram @reverieandink!
