4.0 StarsThis was an entrancing ghost story set in historical Malaysia, under Chinese influence. At times more fantastical than horrifying, this story managed to keep a chilling atmosphere. I particularly enjoyed the cultural influences in this story, specifically those surrounding the traditions of ghost brides.In terms of pace, this was fairly slow burning. The story is very character driven, yet the story never actually stands still. Other than one time in the middle, I didn't mind the pacing. I was overall very engrossed in this unique narrative. I would highly recommend this book to readers looking for a beautiful, creepy story with some Eastern influences.
