I didn’t like this book, which is pretty much opposing to how the majority of people felt about it. I loved the idea but it was poorly executed. I found it clichéd, boring and shallow. as a retelling, it wasn't enticing enough. Kyle is still kind of a dick at the end. And I wasn't interested in his redemption story, and I am pretty sure I started skim-reading two thirds of the way through.
