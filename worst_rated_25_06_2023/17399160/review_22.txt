It was a fun book to read during finals. It was a quick read where you can easily stop (at least the first half) but also can continue if that’s what you want without getting bored.This book was honestly better than I expected but still nothing special. Some twists were very predictable. Basically a typical YA fantasy. There was a love triangle but as someone who absolutely hates this trope, it didn’t annoy me much since the author didn’t focus on it. The romance took the backseat and was barely present. As for the MC, like many others said, she’s badass and cool but I couldn’t connect to her. I liked some side characters, mostly Theron. Mather was also nice but his name is truly awful (how someone who speaks a terrible english would spell mother). This book falls into the books I won’t remember by tomorrow kind of box sadly. It was fun while it lasted but nothing that stays with you. I don’t think I’ll continue with this series since the next 2 books aren’t as good. But I’m honestly relieved that I read Snow like Ashes since it’s the YA that has been on my tbr for the longest time!
