Well this book was an amazing novel which I will not be forgetting for a long time. I have always struggled with getting into the fantasy genre so at the end of 2014 I said to myself that I need to try the genre bit more! Being the second fantasy novel of the year 2015 that I have read It has not disappointed! Bear with me, I do not normally type reviews but I will give this a go! If you want to buy the book with free shipping here is a link.. http://www.bookdepository.com/Snow-Li...Right, I feel in love with the whole setting and world of this novel. The fact that it was split into eight different kingdoms, four seasons and four rhythms. Meira was a wonderful character who even on the first page showed determination! Meira as a character is definitely a brilliant role model as she proves that not giving up and staying strong really pays off! The element of magic in this book was fantastic, I really an jealous that I don't have a cool conduit of magic like a ring or staff! This book is filled with twists and turns that you would ALL love! Sorry for this rushed review, I much prefer talking to my camera....LOVEBen ox
