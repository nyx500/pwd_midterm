******************** 4.5 STARS ********************"Someday we will be more than words in the dark."This book really surprised me! I didn't really think I'd enjoy Snow Like Ashes because all the reviews seemed to range from mixed to just plain average. I just ended up putting this series off until now because the premise honestly sounded so interesting and I figured I should just form my own opinion and see for myself how I'd like this book.At first, I thought that the beginning was a little slow and info-dumpy. I was starting to get a little bored because nothing interesting was really happening. Although the story took awhile to progress, things turned around for me once we got to Cordell. And that ending though. HOLY CRAP. The last 50 pages was crazy! I was practically almost skimming because I was so eager to know what happened next lol.I LOVED THE SEASONS/RHYTHM WORLD. The world building was definitely one of my favorite aspects of the book. I just loved how one half of Primoria is ruled by Seasons and the other by Rhythms. But I also loved how certain magical conduits can only be used by the proper gender to ensure a balance of power between men and women. And all the poor Winterians. Oh, my heart. My heart broke for them so many times. I just loved everything about them. Their bravery, their perseverance. I literally had goosebumps just reading everything that the Winterians had to go through and what they did to keep their kingdom alive through their memories. <3I LOVED OUR MAIN CHARACTER MEIRA. I really enjoyed Meira's character. Not everybody was constantly praising her beauty. Not everyone was falling head over heels for her. And most importantly, not everyone was putting her on a pedestal and constantly kissing her ass. So in short, she's not like Celaena Sardothien lol. I felt like she was more real. More human. Less perfect. But it's those qualities that made Meira such a great character in the first place.THERE'S A LOVE TRIANGLE. But I found myself not minding it as much as I thought I would. In fact, I was even sort of relieved. I never knew we'd have a love triangle in the story prior to reading the book because there wasn't too much buzz about it. I wasn't a big fan of Meira and Mather. Their relationship felt too ordinary to me. It's like I've heard this type of romance before in about a billion other books and movies. Contrary to numerous opinions, I love romance in books. I think it adds the cherry on top of a perfect book. So while people are complaining, "This better not have any romance in it", I'm just shouting, "YES YES YES." :D So I was actually glad that Theron, my baby, came into the picture. I'm 100% on TEAM THERON. Who doesn't want a badass prince who has a great body, great aim (with weapons guys xD), but who also has a softer artistic side to him? Not to mention, he has a personal relationship with his people. He knows them by name and what's going on in their lives. Mather doesn't count because he only had seven Winterians to worry about LOL. Theron is just perfect. So if Meira passes this opportunity up, I'll gladly marry Theron for her. ;)Now that I finally finished Snow Like Ashes, I'm a little worried about Ice Like Fire. I've heard that it's definitely not as good as the first book and now I don't think I want to read the sequel. But I'm hoping Ice Like Fire just came down with second book syndrome, and the rest of the story will come together perfectly in the end.
