Minor spoilers ahead. They won't be marked.I've been reading this book for about 15 days now and I'm so thankful it's OVER! This was one of the most annoying and confusing books I've ever read with the most over descriptive and lyrical writing EVER. Some of the sentences made no sense to me??? I skimmed through the last 25% and could care less what happened. The romance was horrible insta love and Maya was super annoying. Alright, let's start with the good:🔸It's an Indian setting!!Err...that's about it.🔹Even though this is an Indian setting I really didn't learn much about India??? I mean, I seriously learned and understood nothing about India, their customs and culture except for a few words and the fact that the cultural clothing is a sari - which I already knew. Even hough it's full of magic and places like the Other world and The Night Bazaar, I freaking learned nothing new about India. 🔪The over descriptive writing made me want to puke everything out. This book is fulled of over descriptive and a shitload of metaphorical writing to the point where it's not beautiful, but so damn fucking annoying and irritating. It's to the point where some of the sentences don't even fucking make sense. It's to the point where everything is just really fucking weird. I wanted a love thick with time, as inscrutable as if a lathe had carved it from night and as familiar as the marrow in my bones. I wanted the impossible, which made it that much easier to push out of my mind.His voice echoed with all the desperation of someone who has not slaked his thirst in eons and had just spied a goblet of water sweating beads of condensation, thick as planets. His voice lulled me, coated me.What??? The??? Actual??? Fuck??? That's just so damn over descriptive to the point where it doesn't even make sense and is just starting to sound so fucking weird!🔪The Plot: Oh sorry, I started to fall asleep and was #confusedaf??? over that writing thaT I could fucking care less about the story and figure out what's going on??? And I mostly skimmed through this book???🔪This book had the worst insta-love and romance ever. She meets the guy and ten seconds later she agrees to fucking marry him! AND she throws the garland around his neck that seals their marriage. I mean girl, you just fucking met him, what the fuck. And I hate how their kissing and then 5 pages later their fighting and then kissing again, like srsly what the fuck is happening??? And the guy was literally willing to lover her and give half of his kingdom and give Maya whatever the fuck she wanted as soon as they met and got married. Srsly the fuck?“My star-touched queen,” he said softly, as if he was remembering something from long ago. “I would break the world to give you what you want.”“I promised you the moon for your throne and stars to wear in your hair," said Amar, gesturing inside. "And I always keep my promises.”Overall, what the fuck did I just read???? Bc I'm left 100% confused???
