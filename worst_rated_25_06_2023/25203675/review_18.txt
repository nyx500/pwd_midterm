This book was SO BEAUTIFUL. THE WRITING. THE STORY. THE LOVE. I CRY.Part 1 is SUPER confusing and jumps all over the place. Through it all I still loved the main character, Maya, but it was hard to really love the story and get into it, though I was seriously moved by some of the passages. Everything just seemed to be moving too quickly to make sense. But part 2. PART 2. This is really where this book hits its stride. It's over halfway through but man does it make the first part worth it. Things can still feel a little random but it's SO GOOOOOD. SO GOOD. Overall I really liked this book. Beginning was extremely confusing but it got better at the end. The writing was GORGEOUS. The plot seemed jumpy and choppy until the book hit its second part and then it all made sense and came full circle. BLESS THIS BOOK.
