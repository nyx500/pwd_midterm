2 Stars What a waste of an interesting combination of Greek mythology and Indian folklore. This book is the definition of purple prose. There was barely any plot, and what existed was buried under so many metaphors, hyperboles and pretty adjectives it was confusing as heck.Examples:“I love you," he murmured into my hair. "You are my night and stars, the fate I would fix myself to in any life.”“I wanted a love thick with time, as inscrutable as if a lathe had carved it from night and as familiar as the marrow in my bones.”“I see only night and smoke, dreams and glass, embers and wings. And I would not have you any other way.” "I want to lie beside you and know the weight of your dreams," he said, brushing his lips against my knuckles. "I want to share whole worlds with you and write your name in the stars." He moved closer and a chorus of songbirds twittered silver melodies. "I want to measure eternity with your laughter." The whole book is like that. Granted, there are beautiful phrases and some gorgeous imagery. Chokshi has a talent for setting decadent, rich scenes. If I wasn't preoccupied trying to decipher the story itself, I think I could have enjoyed this. Other cons: - Riddles that don't make sense.- Instalove beyond words. It’s literally fate guys, so they don’t need to talk, right?- Girl hate that barely impacts the plot and wasn't necessary - Inconvenient plot points that exist just to drag the story out. “I can’t tell you the whole story-- because magic! You’ll just have to trust me, even though you have no reason too!”- MC’s immediate reaction to being told “don’t touch the things, they’re dangerous” is to touch the things. - One of the coolest settings completely wasted when the last half ends up being a journey-story. Other Pros:- It was pretty unpredictable - Talking zombie-horse who wants to bite people- Said horse's incredibly high sass levelsOverall:Needed more plot and more zombie horse.
