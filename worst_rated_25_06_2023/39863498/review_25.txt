THIS. BOOK.it's rare for me to find a book whose world i wish to inhabit. THE GILDED WOLVES is just that kind of novel. everything about it leaps off the page, from the carefully constructed narrative to the wonderful cast of characters, spanning across the globe, from all walks of life. truly this is one of the most richly diverse books i've ever read.roshani has written one of my favorite YAs of 2019. it's a delight for all the senses.
