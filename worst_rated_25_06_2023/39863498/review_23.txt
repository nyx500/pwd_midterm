â†  4.5 starsThere are absolutely no words I can find that broadly encompass how I feel about this book. A part of it has staked out a place within my heart to claim forever as its own. Roshani Chokshi is masterful, crafting a story so lyrical and full of power, it grabs a hold of something deep inside us all. A search for knowledge that will never quite be sated, or perhaps how the nature of secrets is for them to be unearthed.The world within The Gilded Wolves is one that is rich in history. Set amid Paris during the 1880's, the book offers an intricate look into the time period and a world not too far removed from our own. In it, power is derived from great artifacts of the past, in the form of a magic system known as forging. As always in the presence of a great power, comes the possibility of twisting it towards one's own personal gain. Chokshi explores this in relation to the controlling houses and a group of outcasts searching for power of their own. The best part of this story, not only lies in the subtext and social commentary but this ensemble of characters. All six have such diverse and unique backgrounds that felt well thought out and connected to the development of the narrative. The author really drew upon their individual strengths in crafting the story and how it advanced. This specifically worked with the heist and the revelations leading up to the end of the book. As for the romance, it felt relevant to the characters while not overpowering any of the other elements present in the story. I'm really in awe of every part of this and am pretty sure I have been changed in some way upon reading it. I doubt I'll be forgetting The Gilded Wolves anytime soon.Trigger warnings: ableism, antisemitism (violent, mentioned), anxiety, bullying, character death, child abuse, homophobia, loss of a loved one, physical abuse, racism, spiders, torture, violence
