Allesandra will not settle for marrying a Lord or Duke. She has eyes for only one man, The Shadow King himself. It's not really the Shadow King she wants but his kingdom and to be able to rule from his throne.But first she needs to woo the King, which is made difficult by the fact that no one is allowed to touch him. And protect him from his enemies who threaten his life and intend to take his, soon to be her, kingdom. The first 20 % of this book was excellent and I was so absorbed and wanting to know just how Allesandra was going to pull off her plan. Plus I was enchanted with the Shadow King as well. But the more I read, it became evident to me that something was missing. It felt messy and I wish we got better world building.The characters were likeable. Even Allesandra. When I found out about this book and that the female lead would be the â€˜unapologetically ambitiousâ€™ kind, I was ecstatic!! I am tired of the same MC who is brave and selfless and honourable *rolls eyes*. Allesandra lived up to her Slytherin reputation! She remined me of Jude Duarte (from The folk in the air series by Holly Black) and Mia Corvere (from Nevernight by Jay Kristoff)The other characters were great too. While this book is heavy on the dialogue (which is another thing that bothered me) the banter was good ðŸ‘Œ The writing was fast paced and engaging but the problems I had with world building and lack of character depth in some instances outweighed my enjoyment. The twist at the end was predictable, which isn't exactly a bad thing. The ending felt rushed which is a shame because this is apparently a standalone. The premise of this book is great, it had potential. I just wish it was executed better. 2.5 starsâ€¢ Release date: 25th February 2020 â€¢â€¹ ARC received from publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. â€º
