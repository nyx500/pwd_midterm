A good fantasy debut with a lot of cool magic and fascinating set pieces.There are evil scheming gods and dying worlds in between thriving cities. There are also a lot of great allusions to fantasy classics here. The opening chapter has a nice Tombs of Atuan but-they're-all-orcs vibe. Later, there's a part with more of a Robin Hobb setting, full of assassins in training who get brutally heartbrokenly antagonized. Through the interplay of magic, cultures, and drama, I got a sense of how alive and doomed all these worlds are and how powerful it is to learn the skillset to move between them.There are unpredictable changes from chapter to chapter. I did lose reading momentum about a third of the way in, when the book turned into something more like a sequel to itself. That story was cool too, just jarringly different at first in its changed focus.
