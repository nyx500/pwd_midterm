Tor must have heard me begging the gods for a high fantasy novel written by a woman because my prayers have been answered. Not only is this book so unlike anything Iâ€™ve ever read, itâ€™s incredibly well done (I speak as someone who hasnâ€™t read a ton of high fantasy though). Csorweâ€™s story is one that will stay with me for a while and I highly recommend you all preorder this one ðŸ‘€*special thanks to Tor for sending me an arc of this in exchange for an honest review
