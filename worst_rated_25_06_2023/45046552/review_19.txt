The Unspoken Name has one of the best synopsis I've read in a while, I was so ready to fall head over heels, then I read it and I was disappointed. The worst part is that this book has so much potential, the content in this book is enough for two books but somehow the author did a terrible job at plot execution.I liked the fight scenes, there were well depicted. This book is also diverse, both racially and sexually, Csorwe the protagonist is even queer. There are also different creatures in this, orcs, elfs and humans.The world building is amazing, I love the world, there are different worlds and ships that floats. I really loved the world, sadly I can't say the same of the writing, it was random and disjointed, I just could not connect with the writing. The book is written in third person multiple POV.“Between rust and rot, time devours all enemies. Endurance is all. But we see thou hast a morsel for us.”Unspoken Name is a story about a girl Csorwe who is a bride of a god, she is some kind of conduit for the god. The plan is that at fourteen she'll get sacrificed to the said god. When the time came she met a petitioner for her god. She escaped with the man who is called Sethennai, she basically does all he says cause she feels she owes him.Then everything changed, the author put way too many different plots in just one book. So instead taking time with them she rushed them. There was one part when she helped to overthrow a ruler in a matter of a few weeks, it was so rushed that it felt underwhelming.What made everything worse was the romance, it happened out of the blue, I didn't even care for that. I preferred Tal's pinning for his love interest, that was way better.
