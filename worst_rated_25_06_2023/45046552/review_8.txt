3.75ish stars.It doesn't revolutionize the genre, but I must say that I like reading traditional fantasy epics written by women when the genre has historically been saturated by male authors (whose works are often indistinguishable). And Larkwood infuses enough urban sensibilities and sci-fi elements to keep it from being too traditional. As far as being epic, the book tries very hard to assure us of the gigantic scope, more to its detriment than anything. A lot of world-building elements were introduced that didn't serve much purpose besides broadcasting themselves as existing, for the sake of making the world seem grand. I generally liked the characters, the dialogue, and the plot. I particularly appreciated the diversity of the characters. The main character is even an orc, although I didn't realize it until partway through when gray skin and tusks are referenced more or less in passing. The fact that she's an orc does not seem to serve any purpose or differentiate her from the humans besides the fact that she has gray skin and tusks (which admittedly do come into play once). Not sure yet if I liked everything enough to justify reading an entire series of it, however, if that is the author's/publisher's plan.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library
