Many thanks to Jimmy Patterson for sending me a copy in exchange for an honest reviewThe Selection meets Shadow of the Fox in this amazing debut novel of love, passion and the fight for good.Something people don't realize is how hard it is to make your own world. Sure, we see authors doing it all the time but when you think about it, it so much harder than it appears. Unfortunately, some authors don't do well with world building. This is not that case with this book. The world wasn't so overused that I got annoyed but it also gave me enough information to satisfy my curiosity.That said, I was a bit underwhelmed with the plot. Yes, I understood how the world worked but I felt like it was not used as I hoped it would. The plot idea was clever but it took a while to build and reach the climax. I found myself losing focus.What the plot lacked, the characters made up. I fell in love with all the characters. Especially, Wren. She is such a badass but lovable and funny at the same time. I loved her relationship with Leigh (Is that how it's spelled. I don't know because I listened to the audio so sorry if I misspell things ðŸ˜†)All in all, even though I was a bit underwhelmed, I enjoyed this debut. I look forward to more books from this author.Bottom Line:3.5 StarsAge Recommendation: 14+ (Scary themes, sexual assault and harassment, slavery)Cover: 4/5Plot: 3/5Characters: 4/5| Goodreads | Blog | Pinterest | LinkedIn | YouTube | Instagram
