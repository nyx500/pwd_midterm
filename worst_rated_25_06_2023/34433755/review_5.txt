Update: The more I think about this book, the more I think an accurate rating would be 3 stars, considering that I don't feel enticed enough to read the sequel. This is another case of the concept and subversion of tropes are great, but the characters and relationships are not developed well enough for me to be attached.---What I appreciate most about this book is that it takes the standard YA fantasy narrative of an ordinary yet “special” girl being wed to a powerful king and makes it a story about female empowerment instead. These plots often romanticize the relationship between the girl and the king, but Ngan makes his abuse and problematic behavior clear and integral to the conflict of the story, while highlighting a F/F relationship as the one you should be rooting for. The writing is descriptive and lovely, the pacing is good, and the world building is a unique blend of Malaysian and Chinese culture that mirrors Ngan’s biracial identity. Despite the F/F relationship being underdeveloped and instalovey, and the main character being a generic ordinary-girl-turned-special protagonist, these other aspects make it a standout from other YA fantasy books and worth boosting.
