This is a reread from my high school days. It was fun to reengage with this epic poem. This particular edition is bilingual with Old English on the left and modern English on the right. So technically that cuts the book length in half but does not take away from the story. The poem blends lots of elements of fictional, historical reference, and elements of legends. There are even Biblical allusions of Cain, making him a monster “pained by the sounds of joy.” Beowulf, son Ecgtheow, goes to aid of Hrothgar the Danish king. The Danes are being tormented by a monster, Grendel, who stalks a great hall and kills many men. This epic poem includes the entire tale of Grendel, the monster’s mother, and the fighting of the dragon. I was able to see how Tolkien used the sleeping dragon, underground layer, and cunning thief stealing from the dragon’s hoard of loot. I enjoyed reading this overall. Sometimes I lost focus and found it rambling but some part kept me engaged. This is considered the most important Old English poem and that’s probably why everyone has to read it in school. Thanks!
