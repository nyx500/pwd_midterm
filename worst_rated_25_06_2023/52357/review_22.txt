Oh, how I wish I had written this poem, which I found reproduced in Henry Beard's Poetry for Cats!Grendel's Dog, from BEOCATby the Old English Epic's Unknown Author's Cat*Brave Beocat, | brood-kit of Ecgthmeow,Hearth-pet of Hrothgar | in whose high hallsHe mauled without mercy | many fat mice,Night did not find napping | nor snack-feasting.The wary war-cat, | whiskered paw-wielder,Bearer of the burnished neck-belt | gold-braided collar band,Feller of fleas | fatal, too to ticks,The work of wonder-smiths, | woven with witches’ charms,Sat upon the throne-seat | his ears like sword-pointsUpraised, sharp-tipped, | listening for peril-sounds,When he heard from the moor-hill | howls of the hell-hound,Gruesome hunger-grunts | of Grendel’s Great Dane,Deadly doom-mutt, | dread demon-dog.Then boasted Beocat, | noble battle-kitten,Bane of barrow-bunnies, | bold seeker of nest-booty:“If hand of man unhasped | the heavy hall-doorAnd freed me to frolic forth | to fight the fang-bearing fiend,I would lay the whelpling low | with lethal claw-blows;Fur would fly | and the foe would taste death-food.But resounding snooze-noise, | stern slumber-thunder,Nose-music of men snoring | mead-hammered in the wine-hall,Fills me with sorrow-feeling | for Fate does not see fitTo send some fingered folk | to lift the firm-fastened latchThat I might go grapple | with the grim ghoul-pooch.”Thus spoke the mouse-shredder, | hunter of hall-pests,Short-haired Hrodent-slayer, | greatest of the pussy-Geats.* Modern English verse translation by the Editor's Cat.
