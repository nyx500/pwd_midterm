I vaguely remembered reading this in 7th grade and thought it might be fun to grab the audio version of one of the most important works of Ye Olde English literature.I listened to this twice the other day and then realized a funny thing:Beowulf is basically every 80's action movie ever made. It's true. Hear me out before you start shaking your head no.The entire story centers around one guy wanking around the known world and loudly bragging about himself at every opportunity. He's the ultimate He-Man, who comes complete with a set of bro-groupies faithfully following him from adventure to adventure (jerking him off and singing his praises), all while he shows off his super-strong hand grip powers. And yet, there exist those individuals who will simultaneously scoff at the peasants who enjoy a good mindless action flick and solemnly commend this who knows when it was actually written tale of heroes & monsters. Beause it's old poetry.Ok, imagine this: 10 thousand years from now, for whatever reason, nothing much of our current society has survived.Except the script for Rambo.Which one, Anne? <--doesn't matter, take your pick. And now the Future People think that is some huge clue to how we all lived, while their scholars will praise the unknown author for the poetic phrasing. Rambo will be immortalized as a hero of yore, and little girls in middle school will have to create shitty dioramas of his famous battles.Poor little girls. <--I feel for you.My point is this, if any of you are ever tempted to look down your nose on those of us who spend our time reading comics and watching shit blow up on the big screen, whilst you sip your overpriced coffee and peruse classic literature, remember this was the 8th century's version of John Wick - minus the dog. And that was what survived.Lowbrow entertainment, FTW!
