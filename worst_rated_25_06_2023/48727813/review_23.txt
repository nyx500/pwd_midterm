3.5 starsHistory, gay romance, ambition, war, backstabbing and dead people everywhere 💀This book was so elaborate, so complex, with exceptional historical representation and I’m shocked this is a debut. The talent™!The choice of putting these characters with contrasting personalities together was also very smart: I mean, a prince loved by everyone and a broody introverted general? That’s an easy win. A cold-hearted sarcastic resolute monk and a kind altruistic maternal woman? No need to say more. I found the subtle discourse on gender identity to be just awesome. Having two characters on the opposite specter but dealing with their bodies and society norms in a similar way was pretty clever. You see two sides of the same coin which definitely makes you appreciate a bigger picture of the issue.When I started this book I had no idea what I was getting into. Part 1 has a very different feel from the rest of the book. During the period at the monastery you have the time to get to know Zhu while she grows up and I really enjoyed seeing the way she changed through the years (which I now know that was only the tip of the iceberg, so you have way more shenanigans to look forward to than that 😬).From Part 2 the book completely changes direction and goes deep into war and brutal politics. I love that at one point I started wondering if anyone would stay alive by the time the end would come around. Despite having liked this book, the writing and I.....let’s say we didn’t mesh well. It’s elaborate and complex, and it perfectly complements the historical setting, but it was too dense for my tastes. These are some issues I had during my reading experience:- The writing was very descriptive but I still had trouble visualizing places and characters in my head.- I wasn’t able to really warm to any of the characters because they felt too distant.- Some elements of the plot/world building are given for granted (in particular a thing that concerns Ouyang) and there’s nothing to do apart from ignoring that it’s not explained and getting used to it. Those are big plot points though, and not understanding where they come from is confusing and very far from ideal.- There are a lot of time skips after the first 50 pages and at that point the narrative started to feel kind of diluted for me because I couldn’t directly read about the struggles the characters were going through. This happens especially with battles: you rarely see them actually fighting, you only learn about the outcome. I’m pretty sure this is a duology and with the way this ended I’m really interested to see where the conclusion will go. Those last chapters were wild! “I can’t believe what Ouyang did,” she says staring into space. However I’m going to have to find the courage to pick it up because this one took me a month and it’s only 400 pages lol. I hope the next one has more magic, this first book was centered a lot on history rather than fantasy.I received an advanced reader copy through Netgalley. All opinions are my own.******I NEED 2020 TO BE OVERI’m blaming it on The Poppy War for making me this hungry for new fantasy takes on Chinese history... who do I have to bribe for this one?
