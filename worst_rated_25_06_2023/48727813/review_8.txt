An absolute stunner. Move this to the top of your TBR pile and buckle up. First, a note about the comps. Comps are funny things, and the industry loves them, and some readers love them, too, but I'm not sure the comps on this one (Mulan and Song of Achilles) do this book justice. Yes, there's a girl who disguises herself as a boy and becomes a general but not out of duty or honor or any of that noble stuff. She does it because she covets. She wants. She sees a destiny meant for another and seizes it as her own, and she continues to take and take in ways both horrifying and laudable until the ending which will make you gasp and wonder about the cost of it all. Definitely not Disney. The second plotline (the Achilles plotline) in the book belongs to the "enemy" but that's such an oversimplification that I'm embarrassed I used it. And oh, what a doozy of a story it is. It had been a long time since I've seen a character as complex and nuanced and infuriating and heartbreaking as this one. In a word, I loved him. I wish I'd written him, he's so good. But clearly it was meant for Parker-Chan to bring him to life as only she could. (Also, Patroclus could never.)The story, much like the characters, is ambitious and clever and the depth of emotion Parker-Chan is able to tap into without ever becoming maudlin is astounding. I caught my breath more than once and had to stop and read whole paragraphs to my husband they were so good. (He's not a reader, but I like the think he appreciated them.) There's war and violence and betrayal (oh the betrayal) and destiny both embraced and defied. Incredible work. Cannot wait for the next one.
