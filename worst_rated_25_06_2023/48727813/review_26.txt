If I divide this book in 3 parts then first and last were fantastic but middle was dry and boring in comparison to the other two.Characters of Zhu and Ouyang bound me to the story but others characters didn't impress me as much. The world building was good but I have read better. If you are looking for a page turner, this is not it.
