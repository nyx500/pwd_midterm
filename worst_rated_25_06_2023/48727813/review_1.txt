forget ‘the song of achilles’ comparison you just read in the synopsis/publisher pitch. just pretend you never saw it because it will be doing you a disservice. this is not that kind of book. this is more similar to ‘the poppy war.’ its a dark, brutal, unforgiving tale about characters who will do whatever they can in order the achieve what they believe is their fate. there is no soft, wholesome love in these pages. there are antiheroes who use people and connections in order to serve their purposes. go into this ready for well-written war-heavy descriptions, dense strategic and political maneuvering, unexplainable ghosts, complex characters, interesting motives, and an emotionally charged plot.this is the kind of book it truly is. its one of history and magic and destiny. thank you tor books for the ARC!!↠ 4.5 stars
