“You won’t be the one to make me nothing.”  3.5 ⭐️I was gripped in the beginning but started losing interest by the end. There was a lot to love in here. Zhu begins her life in severe poverty, with her father and brother in a world where girls are worth absolutely nothing. When her father and brother die Zhu chooses to take on her brothers identity and in turn his fate, rather than face her own fate of becoming nothing. I loved Zhu’s determination, her absolute refusal to give up, whatever it takes. She manages to get into a monastery and become a monk.  I would have liked to know how she covered up her periods. It talks about how she avoids bathing in front of the others, but I would have liked that aspect too.I was pretty enthralled, but about half way (ish) when she joins the war and becomes a commander I starting fading out. There is a lot of talk of war strategy, and a lot of names.I loved the focus on gender, and how Zhu sees herself, it was a really interesting perspective. I did like it, hence the 3 stars. Just not enough to push it to 4.  ““I might not know your name…but I know who you are.”  *****************************I wanted to be petty and not read this book. I was offered an ARC by the publisher and was then promptly ghosted. I wanted to sulk and think “screw you then.”However:1. Much as I like to kick off in my head. I’m not really a petty or grudgy person irl. 2. Not the authors fault their publishers are out of order. 3. This book does sound flipping great. 4. My library has a copy available so why the heck not?!
