The first in a series about the battle between two opposing forces: chaos and order. Recluce is a city of almost pure order, where people who compromise that order are exiled. The main character, Lerris, is dissatisfied with never getting straight answers and hopelessly bored. I was reminded a bit of Milo from A Phantom Tollbooth. such a person. But, like any good heroic fantasy, this reluctant, unlikely hero does save the day.The book started very slowly, until Lerris is sent for training, where Modesitt started the world building. His magic system was unorthodox: black wizards are good and white wizards are evil, for example. Once Lerris got settled, the pacing improved.
