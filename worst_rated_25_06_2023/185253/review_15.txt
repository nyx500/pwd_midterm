Read with the #MagicalModesitt group-read organised by Jacob."Chaos is concentrated anarchy, if you will. Order is diffused by nature. They have to balance."Wow. What an interesting magic system. Yin/Yang balance, Order vs Chaos, Black vs White, philosophy of mind, consequences, Newton' 3rd law... and all the gray in between! I like it! Recluce will now be added to my #FinishTheSeries TBR. When I have time to update it. Lol.[Pending Review]
