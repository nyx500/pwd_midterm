If you didn't like The Darkest Minds and are wondering if this is worth reading, don't read it.I began this book with an open mind after not liking TDM. I was going into it blindly because the synopsis was so vague and confusing, and reading this for the first several chapters, I just noted that there's absolutely no hook. From the description to the beginning of this book, everything was totally uninteresting, I had no idea what I was going into, and I was bored with the idea because I didn't understand it. For the first 150 pages I was waiting and waiting for something to happen. By the time it did happen, everything was NOT explained well and I was now both confused, bored, and exasperated. This entire premise needed to be explained better, and between being completely bored, mostly annoyed with the generic premise, and partially confused at the action, I ended up skimming the last half of this book. This might stem partially from the fact that i'm not a fan of historical fiction, but I just hate Alexandra Bracken's writing. This book could have been half the size it actually is, which is nearly 500 pages. There's so much FLUFF in her writing. SO many rhetorical questions and other inner monologue that is completely unnecessary and just drags the pace of the book down, so much so that I did what I told myself I wouldn't do (and did for TDM series)-- skimmed all the pages for dialogue.I can see how other people could enjoy this, but Bracken's books just aren't for me. I almost wish I hadn't wasted the time.
