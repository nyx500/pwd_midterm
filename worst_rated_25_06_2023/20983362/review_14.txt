I had absolutely no expectations going into this one and I am glad to say that I throughly enjoyed it!This book was by no means perfect. At times it was a bit cliche and aspects of the plot were somewhat unoriginal. However what I loved about this book was that it allowed me to completely escape reality. I just had such a fantastic time exploring this world and falling in love with these characters that I didn't have to think about anything else. Overall, this was an extremely fun read and I can't wait to get to the sequel!
