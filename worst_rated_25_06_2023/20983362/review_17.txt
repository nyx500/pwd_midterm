Video review to come!The concept was killer, the characters had a ton of potential, but this book really suffered from first book syndrome, symptoms being: chronic information dumps and a sloooow moving plot. It picked up a lot in the end and I really did have fun reading it, but I didn't love it as much as I had expected. I am excited to see where the series will go though!
