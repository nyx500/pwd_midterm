The founding novel of literature is the one that will inspire all future narratives. We know the story of Ulysses; we have read a few episodes and seen a film but read the whole work, with these long chapters, the Homeric epithets and the lengthy descriptions of the marine world with its monsters and demons. One has the impression of attending a closed session on the sea, and yet, Ulysses only berths to better take to the sea as if the mainland was not only forbidden to him but also harmful as if his condemnation to wandering on the sea was more beneficial on the water than on land. And then there are the episodes worthy of an adventure novel, the Sirens, symbols of literary song, the author's voice who takes us where we want and can destroy us (hey, Bovary), and monsters like Charybdis and Sylla.Finally, this is surprising; we talk more about the others, Telemachus, her son looking for him, and Penelope waiting for her, than about him who wants to return. The novel has almost everything: the search for the other, the quest, the song of words, the pleasure of returning home. It is as enjoyable to study and understand, so full of symbols as it is to read.
