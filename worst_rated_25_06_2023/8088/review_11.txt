I've liked Robin McKinley in a low-level way for the past ten years or so. I really liked Beauty, The Hero and the Crown and The Blue Sword, and when I've seen a new McKinley book I've generally tried to pick it up and read it, for old time's sake. I thought I was fairly familiar with her style and tone.Which is why I was completely unprepared for Sunshine. Who knew McKinley had a dark, experimental, inventive, alternate-universe/vampire novel in her? Who knew she had an engaging, modern, flawed character like Sunshine just waiting to come out and win my heart completely over?Ever since I first picked it up, I reread Sunshine every few months, and it never ceases to enthrall and delight me. It has become one of my favorite books of all time.
