when i saw this in my local library, i thought VS secretly released a new book that was somehow kept quiet. so i was very interested when i found out that its actually a rerelease of her debut novel. reading an authors debut novel, especially after having read their other books first, can be tricky. all authors have to start somewhere, so if the writing or story isnt as great as a reader might be used to, it can be difficult to remember to not judge. but i do think its always enlightening to see an authors roots and their beginnings. and i think ‘the near witch’ does exactly that. in VSs introduction, she calls this book strange and quiet, and i cant think of a better way to describe it. this is definitely a subtle story, one that takes an effort on the readers part to invest in because its not written in a flashy or enticing way. but it definitely has an atmospheric, timeless quality to it, as most witch/fairy tale stories do. its also neat to see well-known schwab themes present in this, just showing how consistent her writing has been over the years. in the end, im glad this didnt come off as a negative reading experience and im happy it randomly caught my eye!↠ 3.5 stars
