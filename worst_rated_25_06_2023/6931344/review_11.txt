I stopped at page 82, roughly one-third of the way through.I am at a loss when it comes to all of the rabid fans of this novel. I found it as dull and drab as the grey skies of moor country.The writing is stilted. The narrator is boringly typical. The author named the little sister "Wren", which is so nauseatingly whimsical and twee, in the YA world of, missing a parent, girls.It did, indeed, feel familiar, as the jacket promised, but not in a comfortable, favorite hoodie, kind of way - more like, "Have I read this before?" It reads like a poorly done mash-up of other, better, supernatural YA books, and episodes of WB monster of the week programming.It's hard to make witches uninteresting to me, but Victoria Schwab manages to do so. Their names? Magda and Dreska Thorne. Oh, boy.This is paint-by-numbers YA with a large kool-aid drinking fan base (I don't know how else to explain the gushing reviews). I'm so glad I checked it out of the library as opposed to paying for it.If I sound super harsh, I'm sorry. I'm critical; I've been on a losing streak with books lately, and it's frustrating, to say the least. Proceed with caution.
