I had hope for this book, witches! Children being kidnapped! Supernatural stuff going on in the backdrop of woodland and small village! What can go wrong?In the end, I can't believe the author actually can manage to make witches and magic and supernatural threat so damn boring.In the end, the teenage romance/love triangle makes the book feels like one of those run-of-the-mill YA.The writing is fine (but not so fine if you compared it to the likes of Neil Gaiman's), and the same can't be said to the characters, the suspense the author obviously tired to create (but failed) and the story. To spice things up, when children are disappearing from the village one by one, our heroine still believes without a doubt that this hot young stranger she had just met JUST HAS TO BE INNOCENT.To spice things up, the heroine's little sister is called 'Wren'.And it's supposed to be the first book of a series? No, thank you. I see no reason why the story has to last longer than one book.
