I was first attracted to this book by the cover with such amazing colours and illustrations. My favourite chapter is Maltcassion, where Jennifer Strange talks to the dragon Maltcassion. This is where the Jasper Fforde humour really shines. If I could I would quote the entire chapter. Maltcassion and Jennifer discuss the human race and its many failures, like the failure to discover the 600 varieties of floon beetle, one of which turns itself inside out for fun. Maltcassion also tells Jennifer that  "As far as the average lobster is concerned mammals - with the possible exception of the armadillo - are built inside out.  and that when crustaceans rule the Earth, humans may begin to regret the lobster dishes and crab sticks. I think my favourite part of the whole book was Maltcassion saying that of course crabs have a sense of humour -  You wouldn't walk sideways for any other reason, would you? I wasn't all that thrilled by the ending, I thought Jennifer's ending was quite random. Overall the plot wasn't as fleshed out as I would like, but it felt like Jasper Fforde had a lot of fun writing this and I certainly had a lot of fun reading it.
