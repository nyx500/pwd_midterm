I listened to the audio book on this one. I know this one was meant for people younger than a [ahem-blah-blah]-something, but I still felt it a bit lacking. To me, this one felt a bit derivative of Harry Potter. At least it started out that way and had witticisms and ideas and writing that seemed that way to me. Magic is part of the world and the world's history. The MC has a familiar called a Quark-beast, which sounded and acted a lot like an owl. The MC, 16 year old Jennifer Strange, is called upon to have an adventure and do things that affects the entire magical world. Published in 2010, The Last Dragonslayer appears to be an alternate version of earth. It had a few interesting ideas, such as that magic was fizzling out of the world, and with it, the sorcerers' powers and importance in global government and social systems. I thought then that sorcerers having to conserve efforts and magical energy since it was disappearing from the world was also an interesting idea that somewhat distinguished the plot from Harry Potter. But at the end of the day, it had "Chosen One" tropes and ideas that were hard to ignore and hard to avoid comparisons to other similar types of stories. It would probably appeal more to younger readers, which is certainly a good thing.
