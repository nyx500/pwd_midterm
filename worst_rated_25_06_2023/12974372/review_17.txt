A Natural History of Dragons is a faux-memoir by an aristocratic lady scientist, a dragon enthusiast. The book had a very strong start, the chapters on her childhood are so promising, and the commentary on women's total legal dependancy on their husbands was very interesting. Unfortunately, the story goes downhill just when it's supposed to get more exciting: when the protagonist goes on an excursion abroad to study dragons.It. Was. So. Boring! The dragons are tangential to the story, at best. They shoot one, and then there's something about preserving dragon bones (snooze). Mostly, we just read about Isabella complaining, doing stupid things, and behaving like she's better than everyone (possibly true to the arrogance of old-timey aristocrats, but not so fun to read about). There was a mystery, I guess, but it wasn't about dragons, so I didn't care.One more observation: the author set the story in Europe but changed the names of the countries (England is Scirling, for example), and it's supposed to be set in "kind of Victorian" times I guess (I actually thought it had more of a Regency feel until there was a mention of a steamship, way into the story). I suppose by fudging the names/dates, the author has more freedom, but to me, it did make it harder to follow the story. When Isabella would go on about different countries/languages, the reader doesn't have any point to reference to what the hell she's talking about, and that gets annoying really fast.All in all, disappointing.
