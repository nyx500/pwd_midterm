[5 Stars] I loved this book. I knew I loved this book after reading only two pages of it. I'm finding it difficult to say anything right now because I loved it that much. This series may even become an all time favorite if each book is as good or better than this one.Though this book is called A Natural History of Dragons it is really more about Lady Trent and how she initially became interested in dragons and also her experience on her first dragon studying expedition. This book also deals with the struggles Lady Trent has to deal with because she is a female in a society that looks down on particularly headstrong women. I loved how this almost Victorian England setting interacts with the fantasy/scientific world of dragons and Lady Trent's almost coming of age story.I loved the way this book was written: the humor, the spunk, the romance, the science, everything. If there was a book that appealed specifically to my taste this would be the one. Lady Trent is literally my kind of lady. Oh, and did I mentioned there are gorgeous illustrations throughout?! The one thing I will say that is disappointing is the lack of development for the side characters. They often felt bland.Overall, if you love fantasy of manners, smart spunky female protagonists, slower fantasy books without many dragons, and brilliant writing this one is definitely for you.
