3ish stars. As with any collection of short stories, there are some brilliant pieces here and some duds. Since these stories are all more or less based in the same alternate history universe established in a previous book by the author, there are perhaps more specific expectations present than in other collections. For the most part, this book holds up under those expectations. Susanna Clarke has achieved a supreme level mastery of language. Her prose is incredible. It doesn't feel like schtick, it feels natural and perfect. There is every bit as much wit and humor as in Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell. And then there's the world she's created full of magic and wicked faeries and proper English ladies and gentlemen. Did you ever look into an English novel? Well, do not trouble yourself. It is nothing but a lot of nonsense about girls with fanciful names getting married.Fortunately she includes some really great female characters in these stories that make up for the lack in quantity in JS&MN. That's sort of the basis for these stories. So it's surprising that there are one or two stories that really only mention magic tangentially and some that after reading I thought, "Was there really a point to that?" There's no way these short stories could have captured the same magic or reach the same breadth of scope as JS&MR but, if nothing else, it felt great to return to this wonderful world for a little while. I am not-so-patiently waiting for Clarke to give us another novel.
