Set in the same world of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, this is a collection of short stories. The introduction to the volume by the character Professor James Sutherland considers who wrote them and of the current state of magic within Great Britain, and just how much the faerie world can influence the regular world.There are a number of different stories in here, from the tale called On Lickerish Hill, where a lady resorts to magic to spin enough flax to satisfy her husbands demands. There is a cameo appearance of the village from Stardust in the story where The Duke of Wellington crosses the wall to find his horse. There are stories of how a faerie bridge was made, and of love lost and gained.I wasnâ€™t keen on every story, but there were some good ones. Particularly liked On Lickerish Hill, the Stardust one, and the one with John Usglass or the Raven King. Worth reading for those that enjoyed Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell.
