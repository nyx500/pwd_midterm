This is a collection of short stories by Susanna Clarke, author of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. She works the same territory as she did with the novel, and to quite brilliant effect. One or two of the stories are connected to the novel but others are not. One story is a tip of the hat to Neil Gaiman.Her style and tone imitate those of the best nineteenth-century authors such as Jane Austen. The stories are dry, witty and humorous on the surface but capable of great depth, darkness and pathos. Yet Clarke is not locked into one particular style, as she brilliantly demonstrates in the story "On Lickerish Hill."Her theme, to put it simply, is the unpredictability and capriciousness of the sidhe or faery-folk. These are not the glorious Elves of Tolkien's high epic. Neither are they the silly and saccharine Victorian sprites of Lewis Carroll. They are a race more wild and dangerous, masters of trickery and illusion, capable of friendship, but curiously able to persecute not only their enemies but even their own kin with scarcely a qualm. They seem always intent on feeding their egos by impressing, seducing or entrapping gullible humans. They are relentless in seeking revenge for the slightest injury done them. Reality and logic seem to bend and warp whenever they are in the vicinity. Yet, occasionally, some lucky humans can get the upper hand if they are persistent.Clarke embroiders a fascinating tapestry of folklore, fairy tale and historical detail in this engaging collection.
