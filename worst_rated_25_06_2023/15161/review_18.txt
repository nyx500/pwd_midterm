This collection of short stories by the author of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell serves as an introduction to the world of magic and faeries in England. The friend who lent it to me referred to it as "starter Susanna Clarke." In that respect, the book was very successfulâ€”I took enough pleasure in these tales enough to move Clarke's formidable 1000-page novel to the top of my to-read list.The title story purports to elaborate on an enigmatic action undertaken by Mr. Strange in Clarke's larger work. Though I suspect my unfamiliarity with that book inhibited my understanding of the magical details, the witty commentary on gender roles needed no additional explanation."On Lickerish Hill" is a retelling of the Rumplestilskin fairy tale. What made this piece interesting to me was Clarke's use of the more liberal spelling traditions of earlier centuries. I've never read an extended piece written in such a fashion; I was surprised to note how easily I fell into reading about blacke dogges and sallade-herbes.Clarke's stories are tightly woven and I was easily drawn into most of the tales. The story "Mr. Simonelle or the Fairy Widower," told through a letter and a series of journal entries, had me so curious about its ending I wished she had continued it further. Upon finishing the book, my re-reading of the introduction provided me with additional insights into this story that made me smile quite a bit, though I did not ultimately learn the outcome I had hoped to.The intersection of the world of faerie and human is a fascinating place, and Clarke's clever collection is a good place to begin that exploration.
