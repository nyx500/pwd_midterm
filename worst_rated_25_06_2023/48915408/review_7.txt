I absolutely loved this – my favourite book of 2021 so far, which has shot straight to my list of all-time favourites. Ava Reid paints a rich and complex picture of a kingdom steeped in ancient magic, straining along seams of religious and cultural tension. From the first page to the last, every facet and detail is beautifully wrought. Rooted in history and myth, The Wolf and the Woodsman is a stunning debut – a powerful and haunting tale of a young woman’s will to live, of love flowering in defiance of tyranny. Every single facet and detail, from the first page to the last, is so beautifully wrought, from the lyrical descriptions of nature to the tortured, slow-burn romance. It will twine like a dark forest around your heart.
