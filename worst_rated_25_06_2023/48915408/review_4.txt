dnf'ing because i am ethically, intellectually, and aesthetically offended by the idea that you can slip a young adult pitmad manuscript in an adult hardcover, add a bit of sex and a sprinkle of gore (in the same puerile prose), and not touch the style or substance at all. it's not the worst young adult novel i've ever tried to read, but it is written childishly, for childrenâ€”both in its stilted sentences and in its self-righteous conviction that the story's simple moral allegory is doing Very Important Work.lipstick on a pig, baby.
