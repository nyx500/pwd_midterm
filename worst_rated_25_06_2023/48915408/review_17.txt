3.5 ⭐️As always for me, I didn’t like the romance. Very instalove. But I enjoyed the world building and all the little stories of lore and mythology that were thrown in. Evike lives in her small Pagan village, as the only girl born without magic. She is picked on and bullied by the other girls. Once a year the Woodsmen come and kidnap one girl to take to the king. To avoid their only Seer being taken, the head of the village dresses Evike up and allows her to be taken. Thus follows a journey that begins with hatred and develops over the course of the book.  Evike and Gaspar reminded me a bit of Nina and Matthias from SoC. I don’t like the idea that Evike taunts Gaspar for his choice of celibacy when he became a Woodsman. And that she finds any chance to try and make him uncomfortable to the point where he ends up sleeping with her anyway. Not my cup of tea. Like I say though, the world building was good so I would be interested to try something else by this author.
