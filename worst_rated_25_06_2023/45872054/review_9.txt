(The sad violinist in me realising she has no talent after reading this novel.)First off, the writing, wow. All I want to say is, if I was to choose a colour to characterise the writing, it'd most assuredly be blue. All the impossibly beautiful shades of blue, all its vibrancy and subtlety imbued, to paint the deepest of seas and palest of winter snow.In all honesty, I should've loved this novel. And I'd have loved if it was a historical fiction rather than a fantasy. At times, the magical realism felt oddly dissonant, an unmelodic mismatch of notes distracting from the thematic focus. It didn't add any more value to the novel than what it'd already have—rather, it diminished what was already a 'magical' story in itself.But all the same, there's something about the story that resonates so deeply and personally—a vibrantly beautiful vibrato, ebbing and throbbing through my veins. It's a story about pouring our passions into something that ultimately will not last. A story rooted in history and yet relentlessly pertinent, steeped in telling immediacy. And it was magical. Not for being a fantasy, but for its portrayals of people and relationships. For showing how there is magic in realising—magic in realising not the fantastical, but the familiar all around us. And for showing how there is magic in us, in those of us who dream, and have dreamt, of something more than what we have. (Aaand, now I gotta go practise, whoops.)3.5/5note: the violinist in me wanted to write all sorts of stupid musical-ly puns into this review, but all good, got her all tied up and stashed in the attic for now, be glad, y'all
