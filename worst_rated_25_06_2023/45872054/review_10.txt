Might as well get this started. I am so underwhelmed by that terrible ending that I kind of resent this book now. It was good, sure, but it wasn't anything too special, and the characters certainly don't help. Nannerl was Mozart's sister who faded out of history due to her status as a woman in the 1700s. But she was actually a child prodigy as well, and composed many pieces, none of which have survived. We only know of these compositions because of her letters to her brother. But as soon as she hit 18, she was married off and promptly forgotten. Her story is very tragic. I did some background research after finishing this, and what I found was just saddening. She had so much potential--she may have even been more talented than her brother, Woferl. But she was shunned and shut away, simply because she was a woman. Luckily, things have changed, or I wouldn't be writing this review right now. However, I don't think this book did her justice. I was motivated to finish by the injustice of it all, not because I actually cared about her character. She was pretty much a standard heroine. No strong emotions most of the time, very bland and uninteresting. Her bond with Woferl was the highlight of this book, though. It was strained at times, but I was close to crying when Woferl told Nannerl he just wanted to be like her. How sweet. This is the story of Nannerl, her beloved compositions, and a faerie prince who promises her immortality in the hearts of musicians everywhere. It's very compelling, but lacks a satisfying ending (the big showdown was over in less than ten pages). The best thing about The Kingdom of Back was the writing. It's atmospheric, evocative, and blends reality with fantasy in such a skillful way that I was constantly guessing what was real and what wasn't. The descriptions are lush and vivid, bursting with life. Marie Lu has definitely improved over the years. I've only read a few chapters of Legend, but this is so much better. Beautiful. 3 stars
