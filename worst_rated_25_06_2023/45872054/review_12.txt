2021 F.A.B. Bookclub pick # I.❤️. F.A.B. I honestly did not know that Mozart had a sister, who was equally as talented. 🧐 Sad, that her own music was not published and heard. I found that historic part of the story very fascinating. Anyway- the magical whimsical fairyland parts were better than expected. 🤗 Overall, this was a pretty good read. ❤️📚
