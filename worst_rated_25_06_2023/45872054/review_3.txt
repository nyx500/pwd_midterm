i love it when stories have the power to inspire action. i love that feeling when you turn the last page and you arent ready to let go of the story just yet, so you do something to make its presence linger, to keep the story in your heart just a little longer. this made me pick up my violin, which i havent touched in about a year, and play one of mozarts violin concertos that i learned when i was a teenager. it was a struggle, but i loved that this story motivated me to do that. i think fans of marie lu will be really surprised by this novel. gone is her dramatic dystopian storytelling and in its place is a light and whimsically crafted tale. and i really like this look for her writing. it feels fresh and quite beautiful at times. this is perfect for readers who love historical fiction, fantasy, and stories about the special bond between a bother and sister. â†  4 stars
