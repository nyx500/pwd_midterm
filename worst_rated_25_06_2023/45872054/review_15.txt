RATINGS: 2.5 STARS"Look hard enough, Fr√§ulein, and the kingdom will show you every truth that your world doesn't."Kingdom of Back is a historical retelling of the Mozart siblings, Nannerl and Woferl, with faeries. It's magical realism. Although the concept of the book had much potential, it misses it's mark. It's predictable and dismal.The story is based upon the childhood of Marianne 'Nannerl' Mozart and Wolfgang 'Wolferl' Mozart. Like her brother, Nannerl has talent of music and composure. She longs to be validated by her father and the world for her talent. Due to medieval patriarchal system, her talent is overshadowed by Wolferl's gifts at a younger age. Hyacinth, a faery princeling, offers Nannerl with acknowledgement and fame for her talent in exchange for three tasks. Surprisingly, Kingdom of Back was created by the real Mozart siblings and the author took a chance to write a story on it. The books adheres to facts while straying towards the faeries and their dubious natures. The world building was on point, at least in terms of YA level but the overall story is unimaginative. It reminded me of Shadow and Bone with tad less drama and more concrete prose. Anyone could've smelled the ending miles away and the plot wasn't engaging enough to compensate for it. The author put efforts towards symbolism and preaching so the book missed it's mark way too lower than it should. After reading the author's note, I felt like I was cheated. Some parts of the plot line that I thought was created by the author were actually the real incidences. Not only the characters were one dimensional but their somewhat appealing traits were the tidbits of the real people. If you cut out Hyacinth's story, which I think you can predict from the blurb, there's nothing new here. Nothing. Abso-fudging-lutely nothing.Thanks for putting me in a reading slump.
