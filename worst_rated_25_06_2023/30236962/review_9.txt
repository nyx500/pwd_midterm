4.5 Stars ⭐️ I have the hardback and paperback of this book. I got them for like a dollar or two. I’m going to use the paperback for a project. I’ve actually listened to one of the audio versions from the library! I love it and I’m going to get this audio version on Audible. This book has mixed reviews but I love it. I don’t know if the narrator is so good that’s it’s not boring or if I would still love it reading it physically. I’m still keeping my hardback! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
