After reading Nataliya's review that contained this little snippet, I removed it from the TBR. This deserves an award, all right. The most overwrought description of a torso ever in science-fiction:“She gazed at Laurence’s face (which looked squarer and more handsome without a big shirt collar framing it), his surprisingly puffy and suckable-looking nipples, his shaved pubes, and the way the leg and stomach hair erupted in a heart-shaped ring around the depilated zone. And she felt like they, the two of them, right here, right now, could make something that defied tragedy.”Let's talk tragedy--specifically, the tragedy of this winning a Locus over City of Blades and The Obelisk Gate.
