I didn't want to finish this but I wanted it to be over. A short book, but every day the Kindle would taunt me with the slow progression of %86% . . . 90% . . . 94% . . .I would groan and sigh every time I went to pick it up. There was no way to remember what was happening because every chapter was so different and so weird. There was very little continuity, huge time jumps, and no cohesion of location - meaning I never knew exactly when or where the charaters were. They said get lost in a book. I was just lost. An odd mash up of magic, sci-fi, and dystopia - I really couldn't tell what this book was trying to be. I thought maybe I would come around if it had a good ending, but it kind of just fizzled.There are certainly some out there who would like this book, but I cannot say who for sure so I am unable to officially recommend it to any demographic.
