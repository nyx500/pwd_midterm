Everless was my last read of 2017 and boy am I grateful that I am ending the year with such a great read üåüThe world building in this story is absolutely phenomenal and so unique y'all I loved the concept of combination of time into fantasy - science fiction and fantasy are two of my favourite genres and although Everless was purely fantasy, I still enjoyed the incorporation of time into a world of queens and magic very much. A big thanks to Netgalley for offering me an ARC for one of my most anticipated reads of 2018! The plot twists left me shook - especially those in the second half of the book because damn they just kept on coming! Liam was my favourite of the Gerling brothers from the first page which surprised me a little because I used to think Roan was more of my type lmao but I guess not? I am not sure what I was expecting before heading into this story but let me tell you, it wasn't disappointing in the least ‚ù§Ô∏è Personally, I would have liked a little more romance or the addition of another POV but I am still excited to read about what will go down in the next book after that epilogue üòä
