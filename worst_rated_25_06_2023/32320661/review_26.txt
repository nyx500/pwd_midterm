Meh... The more I think about it, the more it's a 3 stars...Mini spoiler free review.Buddy Read with JasmineSo... I'm just going to give a mini review because like I said, I feel so ill at the moment. The basis of the book was really interesting a persons time was represented by blood money, so often the poor would die young and the rich would live for many years. In the first few chapters a lot of information is thrown at you with different back stories and it was a lot to take in at some points.Some of the characters seemed to disappear completely from the story which was a bit of a shame because I wanted to know more, Jules as a main character slightly annoyed me and I can't even explain why, it was just one of those things. Up until 300 pages I thought it was okay, the story was good and you could see that it was building up to something, but my god, those last 60 pages were incredible. I can't even begin to explain, but the twist I thought was coming slapped me across the face and was like not today satan! (10 points for anyone that gets my reference)Anyway overall, it was enjoyable, I'm intrigued as to how the next book will carry out, which characters we'll see and how people will behave in the next book.DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNN!Everless - 3 StarsEvermore - 2 Stars
