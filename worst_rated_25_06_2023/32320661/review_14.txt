I’m just sitting here STUNNED y’all. I FEEL BETRAYED BY THE AMOUNT OF PLOT TWISTS THE AUTHOR THREW AT ME.The last 80 or so pages are just plot twist, after plot twist, after plot twist, after, you guessed it ANOTHER PLOT TWIST. Yes, there were that many. While I did see a few of them coming the vast majority I would have never guessed.  Things I liked:-Liam. Honestly at this point is anyone surprised with me? I knew there was more that meets the eye with himIf he was portrayed as a villain for this entire story I wouldn't have minded. -The blood is time, time is currency concept. Overall I did enjoy it, but while most readers are freaking out about how unique and original it is, it's really not LOL. There's literally a movie with the same concept.-Strong female friendships are the best friendships.-ALL THE PLOT TWISTS. EVERY SINGLE ONE.-Jule's father. LOVE THAT MAN. What a dad. Even though he could have just told Jule's the truth and this entire book would have never happened, but still a great dad nonetheless. -The world building was pretty dope and I really enjoyed reading about Everless, sometimes reading about palaces and politics bores the shit out of me but not this time!-Roan dying because Caro thought Jule's loved him BUT SHE REALLY DIDN'T. So she probably loves Liam and just doesn't realize it yet, but that's okay because we still have another book to go There really isn't much I can say that I didn't like besides the pacing felt a little off at times, otherwise I REALLY enjoyed this book and can't wait until next year to get my hands on the next one. A girl can never have too much Liam Gerling in her life.
