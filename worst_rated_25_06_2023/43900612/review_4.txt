So this book has been described as queer black girls overthrowing the patriarchy and yep...that's basically what it is!!This was one of my most anticipated reads of 2020, and it didn't disappoint. It kept me turning the pages, and I loved the main characters, and found the romance to be really sweet as well. I also think this is just such an interesting use of the Cinderella story, so props to Kalynn Bayron for that too. I did find that at times this book could be a little didactic and heavy-handed with its messages. I wish that could have been woven in a little more naturally. But other than that, this was a great read, and I highly recommend it if you're looking for a fast-paced book about a queer black girl trying to take down the patriarchy.
