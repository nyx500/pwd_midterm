The blurb said this book is perfect for Sanderson and Rothfuss fans (me me me)! and i put so high expectation for this book and ended up pretty much disappointed and i feel exhausted when i finished read this The writing style is peculiar .. told in first person and 2nd person told the 1st person story (2 different timelines back and forth every chapter) like 2 people did conversation and sometimes in 3rd person POV.. there were also footnotes and tbh i feel annoyed with them cause they are just unnecessary! the names also equally confusing.. alot of names look too similiar and there were also body swap/soul swap/ gender swap and shapeshifters!! you dont know who is who.. like one person can be 3 other persons? its hella confusing and too MUCH!! THE PLOT omgosh it scattered everywhere, my brain needs to work harder to understand and to try to put everything together.. there are probably 100 characters on this book and i like 0 and remember only 1 name I do like some of the magic system and the world building and also some snarky conversations but Overall i think this book is quite a mess... it can be more enjoyable if the timeline is in the proper order and less crazy names and unimportant characters not sure if i want to pick up the next book
