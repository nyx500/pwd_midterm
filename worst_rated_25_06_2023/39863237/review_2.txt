As someone who loves a hard, defined magic system and concrete worldbuilding, I shouldn't have really liked this. We have two unreliable narrators throughout the bulk giving conflicting information on the magic and history and the characters are a mess of reincarnations, Gods, God Kings, people who swapped bodies, living legends and people who should be dead but aren't dead, making for a confusing read.Despite all of that, I actually really loved this one. The majority of the book is a transcript of 2 people telling the story of our main character, Kihrin, starting at different points in time. The narrative alternates between them, one in first person, one in third, with footnotes being provided by a third party whose relevance to the story is unknown for a large part of the book.The writing style is moderately light, pairing humour and levity with dark topics like slavery, abuse and forced prostitution, providing a very contrasting tone - something else I don't typically like.But for some reason this book just worked for me. I spent a lot of time reading confused about the specifics, timeline and everyone's connection to each other, but I couldn't deny that I was hooked until the very last page.
