3.5 StarsThis was a great start to a new-to-me fantasy series. This book manages to be both complex and accessible at the same time. Told in a unique chronicle style, the narrative weaves together the threads of Kihrin's life into a story of adventure and character growth. The prose was straightforward and easy to follow with plenty of humour infused moments and witty banter. Yet there was a complexity and depth to the story that made for a rich reading experience. One of my favourite aspects was the inclusion of the footnotes. Normally, I find footnotes distracting and disjointed, but these ones actually enhanced the story adding entertaining details to the narrative.The main character was not quite a complex or interesting as I hoped he would be. I found him a bit underwhelmingly average so it was difficult at times that his life story is meant to be front and center on the story. However, in terms of other characters, I really appreciated the positive queer representation, which was naturally woven in many aspect of the story.Overall, this was a solid start to a fantasy series and I look forward to reading through the later books.Disclaimer I received a copy of this book from the publisher.
