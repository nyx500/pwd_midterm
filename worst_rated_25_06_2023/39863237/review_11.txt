4.5/5This book was so. fucking. good. The only reason it lost half a star was probably my own fault since I zoned out a little while I was listening to the audiobook. After I switched to the physical copy I was fully invested. I'll definitely be rereading one day, so hopefully, it'll be a full five stars then!I freaking loved the worldbuilding in this, the magic was interesting and dragons. THERE WERE ACTUAL DRAGONS. I'm calm. I just love dragons. The story is told in alternating timelines until the end of one timeline matches up with the beginning of the other. Personally, I think it was a great idea in the way that it let us put the pieces together from the slightly more distant past to figure out the events of the more recent past without it being info-dumpy or boring. It all tied together so perfectly, answering most of my questions but opening up so many more by the end. Moral of the story is I need the next one now. Right now.
