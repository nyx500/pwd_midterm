This started strong but tapered off a bit at the end for me. I think Stiefvater has only gotten stronger since this series in not only her writing (evidence of which you can definitely see here) but also her character development. I liked but didn't *love* any of the characters in this series, and her characters are usually what make me fall for her stories. So in this one I kept reading because I was intrigued by the plot and it was enjoyable enough. While not a series I see myself ever returning to, I'm glad I have finally read it!
