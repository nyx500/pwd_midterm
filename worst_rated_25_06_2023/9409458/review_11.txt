I usually have a habit of not finishing trilogys...just because I never want them to end. But this is one of the few where I just wanted to read about the characters so bad I had to read it! It did take me a while because I wanted to take my time with it and not rush the entire book in a day (which I could have easily done...) This series has been on my tbr for a solid 5 years maybe(?) and I really regret not reading it sooner. I went into it thinking eh I'm probably not gonna like this but it was just so incredible. The final book was so fast paced, especially near the end, and I just loved every page. The ending was amazing (though it left a few things open I'm hoping are addressed in Sinner) and I couldn't've asked for a better ending. It just felt really rounded to me like we came full circle in a way and it was just great (I did cry a little though js :')) Maggie's writing is just incredible, this is the first series I've read from her and it's definitely won't be the last, I'm pretty sure I want to read everything she's ever written. I haven't had a connection to characters like I did with Sam and Grace (and Cole and Isabel) in a while and it was so nice to love characters so much that it made me urgent to read again! Anyway 5/5 for the entire series, it was amazing I totally recommend it. I wonder how many more good series I have sitting on my shelves unread...
