Let me say this.. Just because I didn't like this book doesn't mean I'm telling everyone not to read it. Everyone has different tastes and different opinions. And if your opinion is to come on MY review and tell me how awesome this book is and that I got it wrong. No I'm pretty sure I read this book correctly ..twice in fact. So keep to yourself, or write your own 5 star review so I can go on it and write "omg!! You are wrong this book it terrible!! You have to hate it to bc I do!"Giving it two stars but I will probably drop it down to one the more I think about this book and it's horrible ending. Did she forget to finish the book? Is there a chapter that they accidentally didn't put in the end? I felt like shiver and linger are two totally separate books from this one .. The first two were so good what the hell was this ?? I want my money back...and the more I think about this bull crap about the reader having to decide what happens in the end the more pissed off I get. No Maggie S I do not want to decide what happens in the end!! I want an ending..If I wanted to use my imagination I wouldnt have paid for a book!
