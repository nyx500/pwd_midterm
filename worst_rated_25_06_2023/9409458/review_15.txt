It's a testament to how well the author can write that I am in love with this book as I have always read books about supernatural/paranormal romance, but I have always had a fastidious distaste of werewolves. I got this book by accident, and when I found out it was about werewolves, I didn't want to read it. But the cover (the uk cover) was so beautiful that I couldn't help but read it. I fell in love with the book and its fluid plot line along with the gorgeous descriptive writing from Sam's eyes to the woods that Grace haunts. I really am hooked on this book, and it takes a very good author to make someone change genre. So its a 5 star review from me on both Shiver and Linger, and I am excitedly awaiting Forever. Also, this book really did make me cry, both from joy and sadness, though don't let that deter you.
