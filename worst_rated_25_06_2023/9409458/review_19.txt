My memory about this series is that it was my favorite in middle school, and I started it when either only two books were out or just two were translated, then I never got to read the third one, because before I could, someone told me both Sam and Grace will become wolfs forever, and it was too depressing for me.But weirdly, none of the information was new to me. How can this be possible? I'm pretty sure I never read it, and I even had a false information about it, yet I felt like I've read it before. Am I a psychic?
