eeeeeh....After reading the first two books, which were amazing, I have to say that this book was absolutely PAINFUL for me to read. Maggie is a poet. I will give her that. She painted pictures in my head that were so precise for me that I didn't have to fill in the blanks with my own creations. But that's about all that I'm going to give praise for.The first big thing I had an issue with was that this book was so long and drawn out that the last 15% of the book was action, and then it was over and the book was finished. The next big thing was the interrogation with Sam and the officers. It was like she inserted this into the book and then didn't think anything on it again. Tom Culpeper and his family just disappeared without a care in the world, and everyone's problems are solved. Which leads me to my next issueNo one will know what happens with Isabel and Cole. Which really does tick me off. If I'm the only one then so be it, but I thought that after all of the "changing" that Isabel did she at least deserved a happy ending like Grace and Sam. Same with Cole. He could at least end up with the girl he wants. My God. Which in turn leads me to my next issue.Why on EARTH was Sam so damn annoying in this one. OH MG. I thought I was going to throttle him through the pages. He needed to become a leader a long time ago. It may be the fact that my boyfriend doesn't show his emotions very often, and it's what I've grown used to after 6 years, but please please please grow a pair. Hopefully M's next male protagonist wont be a whining, pining, P. Whipped B. who cries every time his girlfriend leaves the room. Aside from all of the unanswered questions and Sam annoying the hell out of me...the thing that pissed me off the most was the ending. HOW DARE YOU KEEP US WAITING FOR 2 YEARS AND YOU DON'T EVEN GIVE US AN APPROPRIATE ENDING!!!!! What kind of shit is that. I put MY precious time and money into this series and you leave the ending to our imagination!???!?!?! I don't want to use my G.D. imagination I want you to F*#@ing TELL me what the Hell happens to Grace!@$* &^@^%$ #%&$*^ #$^^&%&@%!!!!!!!!!!!If you couldn't tell from my rating I really didn't like the ending of this book, and I think that the ending of a book counts for half of the goodness of the book! WHAT I WANT TO KNOW (unanswered questions)►What happened with Grace and her family?►What happened with the investigation against Sam regarding Olivia's death and Grace's disappearance?►What happens when Grace is injected with Meningitis?►What happens with Isabel and Cole?►Where does Sam stand with the pack, and will he keep on changing?►Why does the wolf virus look like Malaria?►Why do the wolves of Mercy Falls continue to change, and why does the change eventually blot out their human-ness?
