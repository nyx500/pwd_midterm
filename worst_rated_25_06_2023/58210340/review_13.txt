it probably would have been good if i actually.........caredPast Zoe:Villain romance + a character named Aaron = perfection??Lets hope soHa, I thought, wished and prayed for this to be true but alas it twas not. This concept was so cool. The villain is the main character and the hero as the villian. It had so so much potential but Vanessa Len took the wrong road and I am so fucking mad about it. There was so much that could have been done to make this book amazing but Vanessa missed EVery, Single. Chance to make it so. Its like she tried to make it bad. 1. She missed the chance to use the one bed trope to make the ending so much better. Imagine the tension that there would have been if they had to sleep next to each other. Oh! Imagine it. It would have been a masterpiece. 2. If we saw more of Nick before everything that happened. Because if we did we would have had more of an attachment to him and therefore once again making the story and the ending so much better.3. She somehow made me dislike a fictional man named Aaron *cue shocked gasp* i didn't actually like him at all he was so bland like bro where is the spices?? 4.The fact that I did not actually care for any of the book and that it took me five days to read really speaks on how much I enjoyed this book. 5. That ending could have been SO GOOD if only the author built up relationships. But it felt like Joan didn't really care for anyone tbhAlso i don't know half of the people in this book, I sorta zoned in and out because i was so freaking bored and wanted to get it over and done with so i don't actually know what to say lmao. it brings me a heavy heart to say this but Nick>>>>>Aaron. Bit, BUT only because imagine the ENEMIES TO LOVERS DYNAMIC UGHHH
