This is a very difficult book to rate and i found myself at a crossroad. 𝐈 𝐝𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐁𝐔𝐓 𝐢 𝐝𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐢𝐭 𝐞𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫. Is this a 2 stars read, 3 or is it a 2.5. I really, really don't know. This is a debut novel and I feel horrible but i also can't censor myself when i end up in the lower spectrum of ratings. If I loved this story i wouldn’t have hesitate to use all 20000 characters available to share how much i enjoyed it. So i cannot not share my thoughts now.When you have a blurb that starts with the words 𝐒𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐑𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐫𝐤 𝐅𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐲 𝐄𝐝𝐠𝐞, you have me immediately hooked and excited to find those elements in the book.

Now I get G-rated romance is not very explicite and tame so to speak, but come on it's still romance, so where was the promised emotions of those star crossed lovers, enemies, whatever. Saying they are fated doesn't make it romance, we actually need more than that. Weird thing is i don't actually ship any of them, 𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐈'𝐦 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐛𝐨𝐭𝐡 𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐡𝐨𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐥𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲 𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠. But it's the principle, you say i wrote a Sweeping Romance, well i expect to be swept off my feet, not get stuck in a perpetual state of limbo wondering if my brain is working properly.I'm so downhearted i won't even bother to talk about the characters one on one, I'll just say this, there was no character development or even basic information for us to care or connect with them.

Honestly Aaron was the only character that had an inkling of personality but that doesn't hold anything cause the bar is so low. Joan is the main reason, dont even try to argue.

The making for a great fantasy was there but every aspect and plotline was very underdeveloped because there was no follow-through anywhere in those 400 pages.

This is one of my favorite tropes i am an absolute stan, simp or whatever you want to call it anytime 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐕𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐭𝐢-𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐨 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲, 𝐎𝐫 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐛𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐮𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐦𝐲 𝐛𝐮𝐭 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐂.

It almost felt like they were over-the-top nice as a contrast to being called monster, cause I haven't read one villainous thing in here.

A monster is still a creature, a vilain is still the bad guy just not the one in this story. So i was very disappointed with this juvenile concept of monsters. Being a protagonist doesn't mean you are a one dimensional character with limited emotional range. You know those feelings charts with the faces you show to a toddler or a psychopath to know what they feel? Well here it feels like “The Monsters” were asked to chose what personality they were and they chose the Good or Nice faces and simply stuck to it.

Like hear me out, Vampires can be viewed as monsters or evil but they have a name, they are called vampires. So with that in mind i actually thought we were gonna have creatures from myths and legends dubbed monsters as a whole, and not human looking people with abilities.

As i was saying the pros were the premise, concept and world building, now even if it didn't work for me 𝐢 𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤 𝐢𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐛𝐞 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐚𝐬 𝐚𝐧 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐘𝐀 𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐫𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬. The time traveling and magic aspect of the story was my favorite part despite not being explored more, it still added quite a unique and intriguing vibe to this fantasy world. Also i very much appreciated the fast pacing cause if it wasn't, I would've dnf'ed it.Unfortunately the cons outweighed the pros way too much for me to enjoy this.

Do not make your book into something it's not. There is nothing wrong with YA or MG fantasies, you don't need to sell your book under the Dark, NA banner to be successful.
