I recognized this book was special immediately. Unless Robin Sloan fumbled the writing, I knew I would love it and award five stars. When an oeuvre is distinct from anything that has come before, you can't guess what it will entail. This quest didn't delve into the metaphysical realm I envisioned. Its ultra modernity was unexpected but so too, its stunningly successful balance with elements of antiquity. Where Robin did steer us does not disappoint. I whizzed through his novel with the elation a satisfying excursion brings! After I closed it, I scoured reviews; revved-up to furiously refute low feedback. It is a downer, that some oddballs fail to appreciate a feat of literary uniqueness that has you soaring. My review is for future readers!What really reels us in is better than the cover: cryptic synopsises. Good ones are hard to find. Many are over-dramatically, exaggeratedly cheesy: "Lives changed forever!", as if plain change isn't alerting enough! Many synopsises are spoilers. The summaries of "Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore and "A Wrinkle In Time", 1962, give the least information I have ever seen and they dazzled me. I yearned to know what made this bookstore secretive: a mission dependent on childhood fans of fantasy, an internet geek, a relay of cooperation, and old-fashioned effort. They travel, flee, and inspire loyalty between friends.The ancient history I imagined definitely makes the cut too. There is a coveted mystery to solve, the rare kind of treat I relish! Instead of churning out a crime, this is a genuine mystery: it is all about a puzzle! This novel bestows an unexpected nugget, an overlaying message that moved me most profoundly of all. Computers are great assets but can only handle some forms of intelligence. Books, archives, and creative smarts will not become obsolete!
