Kraken is a complex urban fantasy about a missing squid, an astonishing large cast of characters and the end of the world - in no particular order.China Miéville is an incredibly imaginative author. In this story, he has created a half dozen separate religions with their own gods and customs. (Hundreds more are hinted at.) Not content with that, he also created magic of all kinds, a strike by familiars, protective London-based angels and a supernatural police force.And that's just the tip of the storytelling iceberg.I would put forth the argument that he is one of the most inventive authors I've ever read.That being said, I wanted more story and less world building.Miéville has a cadence to his storytelling. Just when I thought the next important point in the plot would be revealed, he'd unveil a new character. It started to become annoying rather than astonishing.The pace of Kraken is slow, so slow. But, for readers who enjoy a complex setup and completely unexpected reveal, this may be the read for you.Personally, I like my stories to move at a faster clip.There's also a good bit of coarse language in Kraken. I'm not the most sensitive person in the world, but it did grate my ears at times. Consider yourself warned.My absolute favorite character, out of the legions to choose from, is Wati. It's not just for his unique premise either, which is incredibly inventive. (Another tip of the hat to Miéville.)Wati has so much heart. He fearlessly goes where others can't or won't, putting himself in danger for his friends.And Miéville certainly takes the time to build his characters. That is his absolute strength - world and character building.Recommended for readers who enjoy complexity and stunningly fantastical worlds, and who have the patience to thoroughly savor all of it.
