DNF at 25 %I started with high expectations and I really wanted to like this book.The story sounded really good: A giant squid, a museum’s curator protagonist, London, magic, all kinds of cults, theft and murder, the end of the world and lots of weirdness.Unfortunately the execution just did not speak to me.I don’t think it’s a bad book, but it is definitely not my taste.
