Full review now up @ https://bookerification.com/all-the-s... Rating: 3.5 stars Thereâ€™s no denying that 'All the Stars and Teeth' is an entertaining, action-packed read. Even so, it could have been far more thrilling if it were not stuffed with various tropes associated with most young adult (YA) fantasy books. These tropes make the storyline painfully average and predictable. Take, for instance, the main character - princess Amora Montara. The burden she feels from the expectations of others and herself makes her very relatable. However, her character soon becomes repetitive and one-dimensional as her desire to be a great ruler is mentioned repeatedly.  "I am the right choice. The only choice. And I will protect my kingdom." ________________________________Full review to come @ https://bookerification.com/ 3.5 stars. A nice, fun read but somewhat predictable and cliche
