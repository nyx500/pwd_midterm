finally! a new YA fantasy release that i actually found to be entirely enjoyable. 2020 is finally looking up!yes, its full of tropes and predictable material, but THE ADVENTURE! its fun, its fresh, its exciting. the entire journey of the story is what kept me hooked. it made me long for a life where i sail the seven seas, and i hate the ocean, so thats saying something. lol. with mermaids, pirates, legendary sea monsters, and blood magic, there is never a dull moment. yes, the adventure could be a little more intense and emotionally charged, considering an entire kingdom is in danger, but the great pacing and entertaining characters make up for it. overall, im decently impressed with this debut. quite a bit of the story is resolved by the end, so im interested to see where the sequel takes this! â†  4 stars
