why is it always 1am when I finish good books? okay but for real, I loved this even more than the first time I read it! there’s something about Adalyn Grace’s writing style that makes me feel as if I’m in the story. like, I’m not even absorbing the story at this point, the story is absorbing me (d-does that make sense?).can we just appreciate the dark feel this has to it, too? it’s literally a story with dark magic set at sea...can you hear me scream? I don’t know about you but I’m absolute trash for that.plus these characters are so soft yet badass and I need more from them. I stan Ferrick (for some reason), Amora is a queen (and that character development!! we stan!!) Bastian is a big softie (I said what I said) and I love him and sorry for the bisexual energy here but Vataea...yes. so ehm, if you’re looking for me? I’m down the Vataea fanart hole...
