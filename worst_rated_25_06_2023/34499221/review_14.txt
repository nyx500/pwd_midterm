Me being able to read 1000 page books easily but taking centuries to read this 344 page book🤡Logic👏So I gave this 2 stars at first, but then realized that I literally did not enjoy a single part of this book so here we are at 1 star😌 Another book that put me through torture :' )This was the blandest book I've ever read. I think it might even be worse than Crooked Kingdom haha *sobbing* I didn't think I'd be finding another book with a boring cast, plot, and story so soon. I hate this.I'm really questioning whether or not I read the same book as everyone else. And I'm wheezing at the fact that my demonic bestie thought the complete opposite of me. I love that omg.It's been a month since I read this book so bear with me as I try to remember what was the plot and whatnot."The thing about taking something that's not yours is that there will always be someone out there ready to take it back."As the daughter of the Sea Queen, <Siren Princess Lira is supposed to take her eighteenth heart of a prince on her eighteenth birthday. But because Lira doesn't know patience and thirsts for the heart of a prince even though she literally just had to wait two more weeks... she takes the heart of one earlier than expected which goes against all rules and tradition etc, etc. She does something else bad which I don't remember, but as punishment, her mother decides to banish Lira from the Sea Kingdom and turn her into a human, giving her the task of stealing a prince's heart before the Winter Solstice. Failure means she will stay a human forever. *gasp* the horror.“If your only instrument is a sword, then you will always strike at your problems.”On a mission to kill all Sirens, Crown Prince Elian is often found at sea. One day he finds a ✨strange✨ girl out in the middle of the sea just... floating there and alive.Now you see right away all of that just screams "Siren!" but of course, Elian brings her aboard and I can understand that since it's not known that Sirens can transform into humans. But... then you literally watch this strange girl as she speaks with another Siren right in front of you—and yet you still believe that she's human??? And a reminder that you literally found this strange girl floating in the middle of the ocean. Pleasee how dumb can you be??😭🤚He takes in all the ridiculous explanations of her having learned a language that literally no other human has ever been known to speak? To say that Elian is a fool is an understatement :)But I would've forgiven that. Let Elian be a fool—but as long as he's at least an interesting fool BUT THAT WASNT WHAT I GOT. Elian here has a personality of a rock. Actually wait that's an insult to the rock. Anyways, I'm tired of boring love interests :/And Lira is no better. She's just as boring. You'd think because she's a Siren and feasts on the hearts of princes, she would be a super cool character but nope🤡 Honestly, it's like the author was trying too hard for Lira to look cruel and evil that it in the end it all looked like a joke. I could not take Lira seriously at all.Also with my copy of this book, it didn't show the names of either of the two at the top of each chapter so like the way I wasn't able to distinguish who was talking in the beginning-Oh and the romance is a joke. I was promised enemies-to-lovers and yet somehow even that managed to bore me to death. I never thought the day would come when I'd find that trope to be boring like?? The world has gone wrong. The bantering just made me cringe, I'm not even kidding. Just please tell me, HOW DO YOU MAKE AN ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS ROMANCE LAME???At least there was some gorgeous fanart though.The only reason I actually managed to finish this was because I started listening to the audiobook. Me, who never listens to audiobooks listened to the one for this book because I just couldn't get through the story. It was so boring *sobbing*Anyways, my expectations were too high for this and clearly that was a mistake on my part. I will say that the one relationship I did actually like in this book was between Madrid and Kye. Now their bantering was perfect and I enjoyed it. Lira and Elian could learn a lot from those two.(1.5⭐)—for the beautiful fanart this book didn't deserve.•─────⋅☾ ♆ ☽⋅─────•buddy read with demons crisis krizzie and lucid lucy!! <33•─────⋅☾ ♆ ☽⋅─────•Pre-read Review:sirens, princes, and enemies-to-lovers trope??? *very hyped*
