“Everyone is a blank canvas, waiting to be filled with the colour of discovery.”   “Technically, I’m a murderer, but I like to think that’s one of my better qualities.”  - JUST LOOK AT THE BANTER. 4.5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️OKAY I HAVE A NEW BOOK 😏fav that is now on my favorite list. I honestly loved this book and i am so sad its over , one of the best Fantasy standalones that i have read in my reading life. But the thing i always have with a stand alone is that i am sad when its finished and i just want more but oh well i also have that with a 8 book series * throne of glass * * cough * i justt get to attatched. but yes read this its so good. !!!It has lots of great tropes that i am a sucker for. - very slowburn enemies to lovers with lots of banter , i am obsessed with Lira and Elian ok ? - a found family of pirates - lots of found family banter - A morally grey female charracter that reminds me of lila la bard from a darker shade of magicAnd it has a unique worldbuilding with pirates and sirens and mermaids.  To kill a kingdom  follows two main charracters who both have their own pov that switches. The first pov is the pov of Lira who is the daughter of the sea queen aka the most powerfull siren in the ocean world and queen of the ocean. She has been raised needing to kill for her mother and get approval by her evil mother to be worthy of her and the sea kingdom so yes she is very morally grey as she has raised in this way and is a killer. Lira has the hearts of human princes that she killed , one for each life of her year but one day she kills a prince to early and upsets the sea queen who banishes her to the human world and makes her a human instead of a siren. Then she meets up with prince Elian my sassy boy , who wants to be a pirate and is also commander of a ship with a found family of pirates on it [ nikolai is this you ??? ] the prince she is supposed to kill as the last heart in her collection before she will turn queen herself. Elian is a siren hunter and kills sirens for sport but then he rescues a drowing woman in the middle of the sea while he is on a mission too get the key to destory the sea world and ruling of the sea queen who isnt actually a human * winks * their paths cross and they team up. Lira gets into a journey of questioning the way she is raised and the way her kingdom lives under the rule of her mother and what is good and where she wants to stand for aka morally grey. While Elian is struggeling with not wanting to be king but also wanting to make the world a saver place by getting rid for the sirens , but are all sirens evil???????just look at this banter ;  “Elian raises an eyebrow. “You were a lot more charming when you were unconscious.”   ”What would you be losing?” he asks.“If I married you?” I stand to tower above him, pushing away the unraveling thing inside me. “I suppose it would be my mind.”  I also love the writing , its very pretty and has good quotes and everything just flows. Overall this book is such a fun twist on the little mermaid story and i loved it somuch. It has lots of amazing aspects and especially the banter between all the charracters was so funny and entertaining and i came to really care for the charracters and i love the charracter development in this book somuch. I reccomend it to everyone who wants to read a fairy tale retelling standalone with banter , enemies to lovers slowburn , found family and morally greyness.
