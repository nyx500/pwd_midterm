”You are a little heartless today, aren’t you?”“Never,” I say. “There are seventeen under my bed.” I asked for a blood thirsty, dark and twisted siren that lures princes and collects their still warm and dripping hearts. And I wanted a strong human prince that hunts wicked sirens and sea witches for sport. Well, I guess “To Kill a Kingdom” did a great job at delivering all this and even more. ;-P ”Technically, I’m a murderer, but I like to think that’s one of my better qualities.”I went into this book expecting a fast and enjoyable read and if you’re looking for a story like that this book definitely is the right choice for you. I know the reviews for this are about 50:50 when it comes to the ratings but I think that’s mostly due to the expectations you have when you go into a book. If you’re looking for a mind-blowing reading experience you might be disappointed because this story is a lot of things but certainly nothing that will cause you to rethink your life choices. It’s fun, it’s easy, it has plenty of snark, banter and a really great character cast. In short it has everything you need when you want to escape your own world for a little while. ”Lies aren’t answers.”“But they sound so much better than the truth.”This said I really liked our two MCs and I was a huge fan of their interactions. Those two were both confident in their own skin and it was really refreshing to have two characters that know exactly what they want. Lira wants Elian’s heart and Elian wants to destroy all sirens. The best makings of a good partnership, right? XD Well, almost! If their attraction wouldn’t have gotten into their way things certainly might have been a lot easier. ;-) But I AM a sucker for the “enemies to lovers trope” and it was done really nicely in here so I have nothing to complain about. *lol*”They’re eyes of lost innocence, greener than seaweed and constantly searching. Even the empty ocean is prey to him, and he regards it with a mix of suspicion and wonder.”Prince Elian was quite something and to me he was the perfect embodiment of a lost boy. There was no way I wouldn’t love him and his easy nature as well as his love for his crew and ship immediately made him my favourite. Yes, I admit it, I’m a sucker for handsome, sassy and broken pirate boys. They are as much my kryptonite as redheads are so I wasn’t really surprised I ended up liking him so much. Lira on the other hand was pretty awesome too! That girl might have been turned into a human but that did nothing to disguise the feral and deadly siren inside of her. And this brings me to another thing I really enjoyed about this book: Lira and Elian might have been deadly enemies but they still had mutual respect for each other and acknowledged their weaknesses and strengths. ”How wicked this one is, stripped of the innocence I’ve seen in all the others. This is not a prince of inexperience and anxious potential, but one of war and savagery. His heart will be a wonder to behold.””I could have killed her, but I didn’t, because she’s a wonder. A creature that has eluded me for so long and then, finally, appeared. Let me be privy to a face few men live to speak about.”They were fascinated with each other and it showed throughout the entire book. Also can we take a second to appreciate how self-aware they were? Both of them knew exactly what they were capable of and where they would draw the line and even though they questioned themselves and their own decisions they always knew who they were. And the banter!!! Did I already mention the delicious sarcasm and banter? *lol*”Lira,” I say. “I don’t suppose you’d be kind enough to translate?”“I’ve never been accused of kindness before.””What would you be losing?” he asks.“If I married you?” I stand to tower above him, pushing away the unraveling thing inside me. “I suppose it would be my mind.”I loved that they didn’t give each other an inch. They were equals and it wasn’t only easy to see but also palpable. I don’t know how to describe this but there are a lot of books out there that make it seem like the couples in them are equipollent when in fact they are not. Even with kick-ass heroines the male MCs are always stronger somehow. It’s something I noticed in many books and I hate that those amazing women can’t stand on their own feet once they fall in love with their “true love”. It’s something that didn’t happen in here and I was very grateful for it! Lira might have fallen in love with Elian but that didn’t make her go all mushy and lovey-dovey. In fact it only made her even more adamant and relentless, which was AWESOME to behold! XDAll told “To Kill a Kingdom” was exactly the kind of quick and entertaining reading experience I needed and I’m glad I finally decided to give it a shot. It took me long enough to get here but it definitely was worth the wait. And just in case you wondered: Yes, I rediscovered my love for “Ariel – The Little Mermaid” once again. *hums under the sea and leaves the room* ;-P______________________________Okay, that ending was kinda wild! *lol*But the story was really great and I loved the new spin on it! Elian and Lira were exactly how I expected them to be and after reading this I think I’ll be able to enjoy “The Little Mermaid” once again. XDFull RTC soon! Stay tuned! This was a fun ride! ;-P_______________________________After listening to “Ariel – The Little Mermaid” for weeks because my little kid loves her, and after singing “Under the Sea” for about the thousandth time I’m finally ready to tackle “To Kill a Kingdom”! *lol*I need a dark and twisted siren that lures princes and eats collects their bloody hearts! And I need a strong human prince that can’t be fooled by her and hunts wicked sea witches for sport. Yep, that’s exactly what I need right now! A super dark retelling... and then I’ll sing “Under the Sea” with my kid again. With more enthusiasm than ever. ;-P__________________________Can I afford to add another book to my ever growing to-be read pile?No!Am I going to add this awesome book that seems to feature not only a siren but also a handsome pirate prince?ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY!!!! <333
