oh man. this is soooo dark. apparently everything disney taught me about the little mermaid is so very wrong! and honestly, i really dont mind. this retelling is quite gripping. i sped through it because i was dying to know how everything was going to play out. the only drawback i experienced was i didnt like lira. i mean, who knew it could be so difficult to relate to cold, heartless sea witch?? lol. but all the top notch banter and sarcasm definitely made up for it! â†  3.5 stars
