I've gone through some reviews and it seems to me "The Darkness That Comes Before" isn't everybody's cup of tea. There are a lot of one-star reviews and heaps of dnf's. Well, now that I've read it, I guess i know why. I reckon this book is not a walk in the park, Bakker's prose gets a bit cryptical here and there. It's really not the easiest text to get into... and it might get a tad frustrating, alright. I mean, sometimes the reader finds himself wondering what is going on... I, for one, had to stop and go back at least a couple of times in order to string everything together. Also, there are quite a few slow bits and plenty of political tangle BUT, when you finally get the hang of it, TDTCB is highly rewarding in a Malazan-ish sort of way.Aye, imho The Malazan Book of The Fallen is the closest thing to "The Prince of Nothing". Bakker, just like Erickson, throws everything at you without bothering to explain, so the learning curve is extremely steep. It's kind of a messy patchwork with several story-lines but, again, I think it's a tremendous mess.Favourite character: Esmenet. Poor girl, I really felt for her.At the end of the day...
