A simple Persian fairytale based on Sleeping Beauty. My favorite part about this was the sapphic romance; this was the main thing driving me to keep reading because I was like "wait... is it...?!" I wish the protagonist wasn't so wishy-washy though; this dragged the story a lot and made it hard to believe her struggle with being "monstrous" (nothing about her really was evil or monstrous; she's just very indecisive lol).
