4.5 Stars This book wasn’t on my radar but it came today in my MAY FairyLoot (yes, still covid late)Here’s a pic of the stuff with the exception of the bath salts. I tossed them off to the side and forgot to add them. Anyhoo...1. Bookish Tin inspired by We Hunt The Flame2. Bookish Wooden Spoon with a quote from Hero Of The Fall3. Tea Towel inspired by The City Of Brass4. Desert Bath Salts 5. Tribal Desert Candle inspired by An Ember In The Ashes6. Sunglasses Pouch with quote from The Forbidden Wish7. Tarot Cards inspired by Throne of GlassI’m so glad I got this book in my FairyLoot box now! It was soooo freaking good! I loved the poisonous girl with all the fairytale goodness! I loved the characters even though I wanted to smack them around a few times, but I digress! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾BLOG: https://melissa413readsalot.blogspot....
