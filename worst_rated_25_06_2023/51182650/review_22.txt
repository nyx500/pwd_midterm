✅ Original concept✅ Characters✅🆗 Pace✅🆗 Plot🆗 World-building🆗 Romance“Stories always begin the same way: There was and there was not. There is possibility in those words, the chance for hope or despair.”Soraya was cursed by a demon when she was only a baby: anyone who touches her dies instantly. She has spent her life hidden away so she wouldn't tarnish the royal family's reputation (she is the Shah's twin sister after all) or accidentally kill someone and now more than ever, she yearns for warmth and touch. She wants more than this sad isolated life where even her family does not really know her or talk to her. It all seems hopeless until a div (demon) is taken prisoner and brought to the palace. Soraya learns that the only way for her to get rid of her curse would mean betraying her family. Now she needs to decide if a chance at freedom is really worth it.“She had read enough stories to know that the princess and the monster were never the same. She had been alone long enough to know which one she was.”The characters in this book are well developed. Soraya is a complex girl with loads of emotions (good and bad). She spent her life in isolation so she is a bit naive and she wants to be able to touch other people so much that it might lead her to bad decisions, but on the other side, she is not stupid enough to throw everything away simply for a pretty smile. The other two more important characters are also well developed and they bring different aspects of Soraya to light. We can see her grow from a girl who is afraid and tormented by the poison in her veins to a determined and brave woman.The world-building remains basic, but the story focuses more on the characters so it does not affect the quality of the plot. There is action, deception, betrayal, and also a hint of romance, and all in all, it is well balanced. The beginning of the story is a little slow, maybe because Soraya spent so much time hiding inside, wondering what to do, but once she made up her mind the pace picked up and the rest of the book was very enjoyable. Still, I couldn't get that involved in the plot, maybe because of the slow pace at the beginning. I still enjoyed reading this book, but I was expecting more.Fanart by LayaRoseFollow me on Instagram 🙂
