light spoilers, maybeFor fans of classic monster stories, this series opener is crammed full of goodies.Strange Case... is a pastiche goulash, combining characters, events and styles from some stellar authors. The story centers on Mary Jekyll - daughter of the presumably late Dr. Henry Jekyll â€“ as she becomes aware of what kind of scientist her father really was. The introduction of a mysterious Scientific Society allows Goss to include elements from the works of Wells, Hawthorne, Shelley, Stoker and, as this is ultimately a mystery, from Arthur Conan Doyle as well.It is an entertaining mix. I love the homage and the predominantly female cast. As a series starter, the author has established a good basic premise for tons of mysterious adventure.I can't pinpoint specific flaws, but this stayed in the charming and fun realm without ever rising to engrossing and great...which is perfectly fine. I am not at all disappointed, and might seek out the next book as a standby palette cleanser between more immersive reads.
