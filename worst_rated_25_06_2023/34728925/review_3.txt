“The Unfortunate Case of the Gimmicks That Took Over the Story” This was disappointing. Hard to see how anyone could write a mash-up of so many Victorian “monster” stories and make it boring, but that's what Goss has succeeded in doing here. The business of having the characters interjecting comments into the narrative wasn't exactly a problem, but it didn't really add anything, and it was a bit of a distraction from the narrative. The real problem is that the author, in her eagerness to include references to so many Victorian characters, both literary and historical, completely neglected to write an interesting story. We have Jekyll and Hyde, Van Helsing and Renfield, Rappaccini and Moreau, Mary Shelley and her mad scientist, Darwin and Lamarck, Jack the Ripper, Holmes and Watson, and more, but the story holding them all together was, apparently, barely an afterthought. Characterization, also, was neglected, and most of the characters are completely flat.The “conclusion,” after the brief flare of activity that serves as a climax, is utterly interminable. Absolutely nothing happens in the last hundred pages, which are mind-bogglingly dull and repetitious. Reading the Kindle version, I kept supposing that something had to happen, or that maybe the final 10% would be a sample of the next in in the series, but, nope. Two stars, and one of those is for the pretty cover.
