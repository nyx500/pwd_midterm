I don't even know whether I liked this one or not.The story is weird and the MC's a mess. The prose is not difficult to read but dense. The writing is beautiful at times but tedious at others. From a detailed desription of a building or a landscape the author takes you smack right into an equally exquisitely detailed description of say the technique of a proper "socking" (method of torture not article of clothing) or the correct way to suture a stump. Perhaps it is because of the author's particular way of writing that the torture scenes described in this book will make one want to empty his stomach's contents. Granted, there aren't so many of them, but for me those were enough to creep me out.Severian himself is a complete mess as a character. And I think I already mentioned that before. He falls in love instantly (as soon as he lays eyes on the woman) and despite his ardent desire, he wouldn't hesitate to cleave off the head of his so called love (or put a knife in her hand so she can do the job herself). And that is only one of the things that bothered me about him. I honestly resent him.There are so many loose ends and so many bits and parts of the story that don't seem to connect. I suppose it is normal as this is only the first book of the series but still, by the end of it, I ended up having more questions than answers.All in all, I am not sure I will continue with the series. The concept of the future Earth with the dying Sun is great and there are lots of little hints of greatness to come dropped along the way.If you don't balk at dark stuff, don't mind dense flowery prose and are not quesy you could give this a try. It's supposed to be one of those either love or hate books. For me it was neither. It was just sort of "meh".
