I have no idea what to say about this book. I don't even know what I thought of it.I've heard that it's supposed to be difficult to read. I disagree.I've heard that the writing is outstandingly beautiful. I disagree.And so neither my positive nor my negative expectation was met. Moreover, the story was a mess, the main character was a mess and the setting was a mess. Somehow it was still good. The end.
