The first volume of The Book of the New Sun, The Shadow of the Torturer, is a traditional picaresque fantasy, in which a young man, going forth to seek his fortune, gains mentors, weapons, magic jewels, and companions along the way. But this is a picaresque fantasy with a difference, for our hero Severian is no wide-eyed country boy from the shire, but an apprentice torturer, thoroughly schooled in his trade. He speaks of his young life as a thing long passed, and relates his adventures carefully, guardedly, like someone not completely trustworthy, someone re-writing his own history. The world he shows us, which at first seems charmingly (although morbidly) medieval, gradually reveals itself to be the poor remnant of a great modern civilization in decline (perhaps it is ours?), lit by the fading light of a dying sun.Although we sense Severian is untrustworthy, we still believe in his world, for he describes it vividly, evocatively—in the superb prose of Gene Wolfe. His scenic descriptions are brief, but vivid, immersing the reader in a world of ancient buildings and haunted landscapes, of torturer’s cells filled with strange device, with fantastic gardens where the dueller’s weapons--the sharp-leaved flowers—grow.One of the novel’s eccentricities is that each of its pages is peppered with obscure latinate nouns—substantives even an old word-hound like myself does not know—but they help to create a context that is once alien and inviting. (My advice: don’t bother to look these words up. Although they are always actual words, their definitions never quite fit the context. They are primarily here to summon an atmosphere, and they do that very well.)The Shadow of the Torturer ends inconclusively. But that’s OK, because I’m coming back for more.
