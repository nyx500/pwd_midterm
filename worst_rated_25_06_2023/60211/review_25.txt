Okay...what do I say about this book?I read it first back in the '70s and found that I have very little memory of it. Possibly it was at a time when things were a bit stressful...the '70s were like that. Anyway, I decided to reread it.The Shadow of the Torturer is a novel where we are dropped into the middle of a world and get to know it as we go, sort of like "on the job training". I won't give away details as..."what would be the point of learning things as you go" if I spill the beans? What I will say is that we have another one of those books that straddles the line between science fiction and fantasy.Severian, when we meet him is an apprentice torturer...that is member of the Guild, "Seekers for Truth and Penitence". The Seekers are an interesting group. They are the Torturers Guild. They make sure never to to "take in" those who are sadists, those who simply enjoy giving pain. They never, never do more nor less than the "clients" are sentenced to by the courts.If you've read the synopsis then you know that once Severian becomes a Journeyman he is...exiled for showing mercy. He could have and even in his own eyes should have received worse, much worse. There are reasons why that isn't possible however. So, he is exiled to the far away city or Thrax to be Lictor.This in many ways is a somewhat existential book with much internal dialogue on our protagonist's part. The action takes place (after the events above) along the way. So in the tradition of some of the best stories throughout human history here we have a road story, a trip turning into a quest.I really enjoy this book and it comes very close to getting a 5 star rating and would like to, "reserve the right" to up my rating later. I'd say that I can recommend this one very highly and plan to buy the next after I thin out the library book pile a bit.Enjoy.
