More detailed review to come. Suffice to say for now - the setting is magnificent (and almost a character in itself,) our protagonist Severian is fascinating, and Wolfe's prose are among the best I've ever read. Did about 50 pages each day, and this book was an absolute pleasure. Can't wait to continue the series.
