I struggled through this book and spent most of it waiting for the end to redeem it. But then it had no end! It just stopped. If you've read any of my other reviews you may know that books that don't have proper endings are a major pet peeve of mine. I was extra annoyed this time because I'd been told that the beauty of this series lies in the twists and turns brilliantly laid out by Wolfe. I was sorely disappointed.I found this book very difficult to read. I formed no attachment to the protagonist Severian and I didn't care for his narration as an older version of himself telling the story of his young life. His habit of falling in love at first sight many times over became less believable the more times it happened.That said, I didn't give this one star because I think it's a book one has to read the entire series to understand, and then re-read a number of times to truly see the genius in it. My lack of enjoyment reading the first book will likely mean that I never get into a position to understand this series, but I do understand that I'm disliking something partly because I don't fully understand it.
