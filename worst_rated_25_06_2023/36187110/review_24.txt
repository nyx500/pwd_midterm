1. The main character is always doing things that make no sense for the world or internal dialogue, but they forward the plot drama. It gave me a headache, so much whiplash between “no! I must be a cautious mouse!” and somehow him never making a single cautious decision. Or even a logical one. The characterization is a mess and this book is weak on its consistency. It’s kinda all over the place. Every once in a while it seems to realize it isn’t fleshing anything out and that there’s a bunch of problematic implications (see point 2), but then after a sentence touching on the issues, it trips blithely on and the pieces don’t hang together. 2. If that wasn’t enough, I almost set fire to my kindle when I realized one of the main storylines revolves around a “good slaver” trope. She is not good, or sympathetic. She is a magic-world slaver. There were 1000 ways within this text around this to get the same plot, and they probably would have actually helped the story make more sense, but instead we have a slaver who wants to own someone else, use their powers at will, and force them into a marriage they have no interest in to be part of a literal breeding pair because it will help her political interests. Just because she wants to be less evil than the others on some horrifying scale of human suffering does not make her good or sympathetic or anything else. She is a slaver. She is not good. She is literally willing to die instead of setting her magic slave free.I remember now why I stopped preordering debuts.
