A short fantasy with a setting inspired by Edwardian England and with a compelling protagonist.Dr Miles Singer is a returned veteran working at a hospital as a psychiatrist. Only that's not the whole story: he's also Sir Christopher Miles Hensley, a powerful Secondary Mage, who would be bound as a living battery by his family of Mages had he not run off to war and disappeared. But the war is won, and the returning soldiers are putting an immense strain on the country's mental health facilities and Miles himself. And that's all on top of his family discovering his hiding place and planning to use him in their political maneuvering as well as a very strange visitor from somewhere else entirely.There's a lot going on here and the author makes excellent use of scaffolding of Edwardian Era of England to shortcut a lot of the world-building. This isn't England, or our Earth, but it's similar enough in terms of technology and societal mores to not have to convey much of the setting to the reader. There's still plenty of fantastic elements though, including aether instead of electricity, and that souls are real and that magic is also known and separated on strict class lines.It's also action-packed, with Miles getting entangled with his family again and the politics of the Mages and the aftermath of the recent war front and center along with the investigation being conducted by Miles' mysterious visitor and possible love interest. It puts the focus on familial obligation and feeling as well as how individuals serve society and their agency to do so.I really enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to the next one.
