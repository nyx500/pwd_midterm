reading is not enough i need to eat the book[and my real review]unfortunately for me, i could not eat this book, though i certainly did read it. the book eaters goes beyond science fiction and dives into an entirely new realm, exploring a world in which monsters are not the green people from outer space or the giant creatures, but the people who operate in the systems around us. what shapes a monster? what identifies a monster? and in the end, who holds the power to decide who is a monster and who is not? it would be so easy to write devon off as a vicious, villainous, violent (alliteration!) woman, and perhaps she is. or perhaps she is just a woman, and perhaps the villains are the systems in place, archaic but adapting, that force devon to make certain choices. perhaps she is a morally reprehensible person. perhaps her entire worldview is wrong. but love is not "inherently good", as she notes, and that is her framework, for better or for worse.i think if i were a book eater, this book would taste of smoke, perhaps with a little bit of sweetness. i happen to like things that taste of smoke, but a lot of people won't. along that vein this book certainly won't be palatable to everyone. i found it more a reflection on womanhood and motherhood and queerness, in all its forms, and less a science fiction romp through the world of eating books or a story with very intricately developed plot lines and relationships. it leaves you with a distinct feeling, though, whether good or bad or none of the above. i think it did what it set out to accomplish, though. it's an undeniably powerful book. i kind of want to eat it.
