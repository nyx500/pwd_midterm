Way out of my comfort zone, but I still enjoyed its many topics and feelings.Welcome to the Moors, a place that always seemed to engender an idea of fog, mist, and frightening things. In this story living in the Moors is a group who survive by eating the pages of book, while assimilating their contents. Girls are a prized commodity and are fed books of fairy tales and princes riding in on white chargers. Devon is the young girl being fed these make believe stories, so that she could be prepared for her future life, which she learns much to her chagrin, is to mate every two years with a man selected for her (by money) to become pregnant with a girl child.Girls were used as bargaining chips, boys were often discarded. Devon is a fighter with a bunch of brothers who were raised on books about knights and dragons. They are ferociously dedicated to the tenets of the group. There is a downside other than the obvious, some book eaters can be born desiring to consume the brains of humans. This is revolting, but there is a drug, Revolution, that can be fed to these unfortunates, although the drug is used for the pleasure of the group. Horror occurs when Devon gives birth to one of these creatures. Having had to give up her daughter years ago, whom she never saw, Devon was determined to keep her son, Cai, and escapes the compound and starts a journey of danger, escaping from the group members assigned to find her and Cai, and of course finding suitable food for Cai.Although it might be off setting to many, the author did bring into the story many aspects of being a woman, often unprepared for real life, homosexuality, and being conditioned about how to think. Interesting and disturbing, I was totally involved in listening to this tale.
