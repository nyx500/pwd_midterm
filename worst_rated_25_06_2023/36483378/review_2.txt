you know that moment when youre reading and you lose focus, but your eyes still keep ‘reading,’ so you end up having to backtrack and reread everything you just missed when you zoned out? yeah, that happened to me soooo many times whilst reading this that i lost count. at the halfway point, i started skimming because i just did not have the attention span to fully commit to this. i mean, i really wanted to love this, but other than a slightly unique magic system, theres not much going for this book that would have otherwise kept me engaged. and i think its the dense writing and repetitive nature of the narrative that is so off-putting. also, i think anyone who isnt a native english speaker will have a difficult time with this, just because the writing is just so forced and crowded. sure, its a nice effort for a debut, but this really isnt anything i havent read before. definitely an unpopular opinion, i know. but hey, what can you do? guess i could round up my rating, at least. ↠ 2.5 stars
