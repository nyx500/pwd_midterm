4.5 stars, rounding up. This is a YA dark fantasy, and dark it is, from the first line (a great line, btw). A world of castes and brutality (including a certain white-robed vigilante group that reigns down terror on our protagonist, the first time I've seen the KKK allegorized in fantasy is such an effective way) that is thoughtfully written and frankly, wonderfully vivid, particularly in the minutiae. I loved the details that went into the worldbuilding, including names, language, cultural practices and, above all, voice. The magic system was creative and unique, the character growth pleasing, and, like I said, voice for days. There are a few flaws, as there are in all books, but frankly I don't think they're worth elaborating. It didn't take away from the enjoyment of the book. Even if you don't usually read YA, this one is worth a look. It straddles the older YA/adult line in content (violence, off-screen sex) and deserves a wide audience.
