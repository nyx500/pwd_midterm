Re-read 26.09.20Honestly enjoyed it just as much the second time around ALSOOO very glad I re-read because I forgot something that is MAJOUR and is of kicked myself! Can’t wait to pick up the Faithless Hawk now :)————I’ve been going backwards and forwards with what rating to give this and I’ve decided it’s a 5 Stars for me!Just to put this out there it took me a while to get into it because the magic system was very unique and there were lots of different Castes with different abilities but I honestly loved it! I genuinely struggled to read the first 50ish pages and you have to pay attention to it otherwise it may end up going over your head.I genuinely loved the characters, especially Fie, Tavin and Jasimir! Hopefully I can write a fuller review but these are just my quick thoughts! I’m genuinely so excited for the next book and I have no idea what to expect!The Merciful Crow - 5 StarsThe Faithless Hawk - 4 Stars
