Can someone actually kill me? The more I think about this book the more I want to curl up in a bawl and die. I also highkey just want to punch Cassie for doing this to us. How dare she ðŸ˜­HELLO I AM BACK TO ROUND UP TO 5 STARS EVEN THOUGH ITS 4.5 BECAUSE AMBER REMINDED ME HOW CRAZY THIS PLOT WAS BUT LIKE IT WAS STILL MISSING A LITTLE SOMETHING BUT NOT ENOUGH TO KNOCK OFF A WHOLE STARTHAT IS ALL GOODBYEI feel nothing. I am dead inside. Fuck you Cassie Clare. Fuck this book. Fuck my feelings. What the hell. I just. Can't. Only 4.5 stars because it dragged a bit and I felt nothing was happening for a while but I don't know how to feel oh my god. WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME CASSIE?! Why did you do this to our characters?! Why the fuck is everything going wrong?! Why can't we just all be happy Everyone I hated before I no longer hate! Mainly Mark and Kit. I couldn't stand them in Lady Midnight but now they're great. I am shook. Guys I don't know how to write a review?? I will definitely be coming back in the next few days with my updated feels but right now I'm just upset. I don't know how to feel anything other than broken and I can't believe we have to wait two years for the next book. BUDDY READ WITH AMBER WHO HATES ME RIGHT NOW FOR GETTING THIS BOOK EARLY BUT ITS OKAY BECAUSE I LOVE HER ENOUGH FOR THE BOTH OF USI CANT BELIEVE DYMOCKS HAD EARLY COPIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
