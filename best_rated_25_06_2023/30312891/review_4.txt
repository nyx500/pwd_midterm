I've finished screaming. I'm ready to talk Continue on for 25% memes, 50% why I love this book, 25% more screaming(there may be mild spoilers untagged like new character names but everything major will be tagged)“Everyone is afraid of something. We fear things because we value them. We fear losing people because we love them. We fear dying because we value being alive. Don't wish you didn't fear anything. All that would mean is that you didn't feel anything.”by Oblivion's Dream on tumblr I ADORE this Emma art!I ..... I am shocked to be saying this but, THIS is my favourite Cassandra Clare series. I'm sorry Infernal Devices, IM SORRY. (but also not really this series is so good) Like, if you tear out the final pages of this book it's nearly perfect and Lady Midnight IS perfect. LORD OF SHADOWS IN GENERALI don't think I loved lord of shadows as much as I loved Lady Midnight but I still really really enjoyed it. I absolutely adore the characters in this series, especially Emma, Julian, Cristina, Livvy, Kit and Ty so having them all back in Lord of Shadows was of course a highlight. I just love how COMPLEX these characters are. Every single one has so many dichotomies and intricacies that make them fascinating. I think in Julian, especially, that is showcased, but also in Mark, Cristina and Emma too. The way the plot moved from location to location, featuring the Faerie Realms, London, Alicante and LA was fun for me, I liked how the story moved around more then it did in Lady Midnight. There was also so many moments that left me genuinely shocked and I read this entire book at maximum speed because so much of it left me having to know what happens IMMEDIATELY. I know heaps of people find Cassandra Clare boring, but I personally find her books really addictive, and I want to know what happens straight away. You know the old 'take a peek at the end of the chapter because what the fuck is happening' trick? me in every chapter of her books. “Kit thought about Emma with her sword, Emma saving his life, Emma hugging Cristina and looking at Julian like he hung the moon” Lord of Shadows feels much more mature then Lady Midnight and I think that is a real strength of this book. Lord of Shadows definitely critically examined the world we live in today through the lens of the shadow world, and much of the discussion and plot point was very on-point for current events. That did show a maturity in Cassandra Clare's writing, and I do definitely think this is her most political and developed book (and series). Representation was also fairly good for a Cassandra Clare book. Mark and Kieran are bisexual, Diana is a black transwoman, Cristina, Jaimie and Diego are all Mexican. Ty is autistic and heavily implied to be gay, and Kit is heavily implied to be bisexual. Dru is fat. Aline (gay, chinese), Helen (bisexual) and Jem (chinese), Alec (gay) and Magnus (biracial and bisexual) also appear but are only in it for a very short time. I DID HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH BISEXUAL REPRESENTATION WHICH YOU CAN READ ON MY TWITTER THREADI didn't like Lord of Shadows as much as Lady Midnight because of some of the characters and the plot points and I'll get into that below. But it's still such a fucking solid book I really loved reading it. CHARACTERSEMMA: Honestly, y'all who hate Emma can get off my fucking lawn I love her SO MUCH. She's brave, smart, loyal, loving, protective, caring. She cares so much about the Blackthorns and her parents and she wants to be loved back so much in return, and I just really need her to be happy and okay. I love her strength and resilience so much. She's definitely my favourite character I love her. ALSO SHE DESTROYED THE MORTAL SWORD !!?? SHE KILLED A FAERIE RIDER !! DOES SHE GIVE 1 MOTHER FUCK ??? SHE DOES NOT !!!!! WE LOVE A LEGEND !!!  JULIAN: HE SCARES ME BUT I LOVE HIM. He's so soft with the kids even though he's NOT SOFT IN GENERAL and his character is really interesting because there is this dichotomy between the soft, loving parent he is for the kids, and then the hard, callous shadowhunter he has the potential to be and often exhibits. I'm really, really excited to see where his character arc is taken in Queen of Air and Darkness because the ending of LOS has left him in a position to swing in an extreme direction. JULIAN JUST LOVES THOSE KIDS SO MUCH AND HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR THEM AND LOVES THEM SO MUCH AND IT MAKES ME EMO. !!!! MARK: I have to admit... I don't love Mark as much as everyone else but he's okay. I was really wanting to see some good character growth from him but ... I'm a little iffy on him. This I'm gonna get into. CRISTINA: Cristina is such a GREAT CHARACTER. I love her relationship with Emma and her growth as a character and how she's become part of the family. I liked the exploration of her past with Jaimie and Diego. BUT, I found her plotline with Mark/Kieran really annoying. KIT, TY AND LIVVY: I absolutely loved this trio. They definitely added a new dynamic that wasn't there in Lady Midnight. Each is such a fun character, though Kit was my favourite because I loved his humour, and how his mundane culture clashed with the shadowhunter culture in both positive and negative ways.  The scene with Kit talking about autism with Julian re: Ty was one of my favourite scenes. I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT LIVVY BECAUSE IM UPSET AND NOT OKAY WITH ITDRU: Dru is a character I really want to like, and can really see myself liking in the future, but I found her arc a little awkward and boring. I did like her arc concerning her self-image and her role amongst the blackthorns, and I'm excited to see more from her in The Wicked PowersZARA DEARBOTH: god ....  I HATE HER SOOO MUCH. HERE IS A SUMMARY OF ME EVERYTIME SHE SPOKEWHEN SHE CALLED EMMA A SLUTEVERYTIME SHE SAID SOMETHING RACISTROMANCERight, the main issue I had with Lord of Shadows was the oversaturation of romance and make out scenes. WE GET IT, EVERYONE IS SUPER HOT.Lets start with Kieran ....... His relationship with Mark is Unhealthy And Needs To Be Discontinued Immediately - forgetting what you did doesn't excuse what you did- sending ...... someone ...... dreams ................... it wasn't .... cute- remember when he manipulated Mark many many times- like not... spill the tea. but.... people need to shot shipping them just because they're two hot guys because Kierat really isn't a NICE GUY- im saltyThe drama with Kieran/Mark/Cristina was ANNOYING, it was annoying.  And literally all the "I looked at him and immediately had to make out with him" IM EXHAUSTED. No one has this much sexual chemistry and tension in real life nO ONEEmma and Jules are NOT free of this because they were also bad, though I don't think they are AS BAD but fgfj still STOP KISSING AND START SOLVING YOUR MANY ABUNDANT ISSUES. There was so many make out steamy scenes I actually got bored of steamy make out scenes. Kitty and Kitliv is excused from this mess they are all Pure. by Oblivion's Dream on tumblrPLOTI found the first 100 pages kind of underwhelming not gonna lie. But after that it got way way better. Enjoyed the Mark/Emma dynamic, and their genuine friendship that came from it. Really liked the trip into Faerie, and what we saw from Julian and Emma there. LOVED the scenes in London, and all the references to the TID characters, as well as the appearance of tmi/tid characters. Was super cool to see Magnus and Alec as dads. MY TOP 5 SCENES1: The fight scene with the Faeries outside the London institute and then at the cabin. The action sequence was amazing and there was so much genuine tension I really thought everyone was gonna die2: The entire fight scene at the Unseelie court. Loved the vulnerable side of Emma we saw unmasking her "dad" and also the vicious side we saw from Julian. 3: Jules and Emma's talk after the fight. I thought it was a scene of such good character development and really needed. Their relationship is great I really love it and I think they're good together. 4: Kit in general. Loved him talking to Ty, especially when they talked about Livvy. Loved his discussion with Jules about Ty, and also loved his list of shadowhunter problems jgfhjf5: Ty's letter to Annabel was amazing, and not just the letter itself but how much it meant to Julian to read that and know how much those kids fucking love him. “Sometimes the most ruthless heart speaks the most truth” Lord of Shadows is an absolute monster of a book, and there is so much to talk about. This small review barely even covers the surface of my feelings about this book. I truly adore all the characters so much, I have so much genuine concern over their happiness. The plot really picked up and I am DYING for Queen of Air and Darkness. I can't believe we have to wait until 2019. I AM READY FOR ANTI-HERO JULIAN TO RISEThere is so much going on in these books, and so many little arcs that accompany the larger one, but the books are so fun and definitely Cassandra's strongest works character, plot and writing wise. I have always been willing to criticise her work, but I do think she worked on some of those criticisms in this series. Its much, much stronger then tmi AND tid in my opinion. I AM NOT OKAY WITH THE ENDING. I don't think it's possible to be okay with that ending.
