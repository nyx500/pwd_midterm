Currently rereading this with the fun chicks over at the Ilona Andrews Addicts group.Rereading such epicness was a blast. I think this was the book that finally got me to fall for Curran. He was too much of an alpha-asshole for me until now. But, the way he turns it around and finally shows some respect for Kate made me love him at last. Good kitty.Original review from Feb, 2015:Crazy Aunts - we've all got one. My crazy aunt took me to a gay bar when I was 16 years old (I didn't realize that some of those women weren't men...). Hey, I was just happy to be in a bar at 16, I had no idea... But, Kate's aunt is literally a psychopath:"You're a psychopath.""What does that mean?"I got up and brought her a dictionary. She read the definition. "That sums it up well, yes...." Not exactly Auntie Em.But, one of the best parts of this book, to me, was the addition of Kate's new dog - the attack poodle. I am a dog person. I have three dogs, two of them are very large labs, and the things Kate says about her attack poodle cracked me up so much because I could, unfortunately, relate.Apparently "stay" in faithful canine companion language meant "follow with enthusiastic glee."...I opened the door and saw a huge slimy pile of dog puke cooling in the middle of my hallway carpet. The attack poodle sat nearby, an expression of perfect innocence on his narrow mug. I pointed at the puke. "That was a dick move." The attack poodle wagged his tail....The attack poodle trotted around me and proceeded to vomit an inch from my left boot."Delightful," Saiman reflected as the dog, having puked his guts out, urinated on the nearest wall."He's a dog of simple pleasures," I told him. Okay, this ^ stuff really got me laughing out loud, in the middle of the night, while all of my family was trying to sleep. If I'm not careful, they will be calling me a psychopath pretty soon!
