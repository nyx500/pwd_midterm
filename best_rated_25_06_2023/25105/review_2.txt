"Destiny is blind"None of us know our path in life. We never know where we may end up despite how much we try to forge a direction for ourselves. We try to give ourselves purpose and meaning but, in all honesty, we truly could end up anywhere and doing anything. Life is an endless possibility. And destiny, destiny is blind. Dreams are made real if only we believe in them. Reading this makes me want to stop, to stop under the starry night sky and imagine the possibilities of life and the universe. The concepts this series grapples with are hugely conceptual and imaginative. I am in awe as I read because I’ve never seen anything on such a large scale dealt with in a comic book. The idea that such beings, beings that are themselves concepts formed into caricatures called the Endless, reside behind everything that has ever been is simply phenomenal.As I read this volume, I started to see early echoes of Gaiman’s  American Gods. There are hints to where his thoughts are going and what he would one day eventually write. I’m not a massive fan of that book because I don’t think the delivery of it matched the scope of the storytelling, though here it works perfectly. And for me this has been the strongest volume in a while. I feel like the series has finally found some momentum and is finally heading somewhere big and beautiful. Facebook| Twitter| Insta| Academia
