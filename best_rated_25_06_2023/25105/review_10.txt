4. 1/2If you also weren't a fan of volume 6, please don't take a break like I did. Try reading 4 chapters of this volume and unless you aren't liking this serial as a whole, then you definitely won't regret it. The Sandman, Vol. 7: Brief Lives has a very high rating for a reason.I randomly decided to pick up this volume last week. I have stopped reading this comic series a couple of years ago. You see, volume 6 was a real struggle to read. Luckily, a few years later, I was running behind on my yearly challenge. So I thought why not continue the Sandman?I read 2 chapters last Monday and I simply couldn't continue reading. They were so boring and made 0 sense, one of the reasons why I didn't like the previous volume was that the stories weren't related. BUT I decided to be strong and just finish this damn volume regardless at 1 am yesterday. Without noticing, I found myself so engrossed in this volume and I couldn't stop reading. Then, my friend sends me a link to the Netflix teaser, which was ironically released yesterday, and after fangirling and LOOK THIS IS TYWIN LANNISTER. Dance playing the bad guy again! It got really late so I finished Brief Lives today and it was freakin awesome. I highly enjoyed this volume mainly because of one character: Destruction. And well, Dream but that goes without saying. We learn more about this mysterious brother and discover more about the Endless's relationships. Their interactions continue to be one of the things I like the most about the Sandman.Now, I'm looking forward to reading the next installment and I really hope it's going to be good. I still don't like the art whatsoever, and reading this comic isn't very fun because I have to zoom it all the time but the story became good again, fortunately. I’ve had lots of ups and downs with this serial. I’m curious how it’ll end especially after watching that teaser.
