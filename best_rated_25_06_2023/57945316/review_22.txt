A full dark academia themed video and review is featured on my booktube channel here!I promise you all - this book is astounding. Words cannot do it justice (the irony, ha). This is everything I long for in dark academia. It presents the obsessive, fanatical cycle of studying, the weird thrill that comes from achieving the overworked student aesthetic. It presents a feeling of camaraderie amongst likeminded souls, and the conviction that all else is immaterial. But it also presents many brutal truths - the violence behind academia. The cost of knowledge as a resource. The web of accepted deceptions society is built upon. Every contradiction of obsession, hatred, comfort, violence, and so much more is captured in this book. It hurt. Iâ€™m wounded. And I loved it ðŸ¥¹Thank you to the publisher for sending me a copy of this book for review! This in no way affects my opinion of the book itself.
