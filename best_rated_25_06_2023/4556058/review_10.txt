Hello, my name is PJO Trash™ nice to meet you. I’ve been blessed to join this fandom due to the INCREDIBLE and significant amounts of fan art. It helps me survive.  The Last Olympian  continues off from the previous book. Kronos’s army is gaining rapid strength and the Half-Bloods are having a hard enough time holding the crazy beast, Typhon. Kronos takes his chance and begins advancing on New York City, home to an unguarded Mouth Olympus. Also, let’s not forget, Percy’s terrible prophecy is days away and the future ain’t looking so bright. But these heroes aren’t going to stop until they give it their all and believe me, it’s SO INCREIDLBY EXCITING!I listened to the audiobook and Jesse Bernstein’s voice is EXACTLY how I imagined Percy. 10/10Also, the sass levels on every single character is notable. I am thoroughly impressed, Uncle Rick.  Minor Spoilers Ahead  not like anyone cares I mean basically EVERYONE has read this Me being #percabeth trash is no news to anyone, but I’ve stumbled upon a goldmine of fanart and I’m very happy here plz don’t take me away from my happiness. Wanna know what caused my death? THIS SCENE:AND THISAnd that ending, good Lord, that was the best, most cutest, fitting ending ever. My heart is so content.This was me every #Percabeth scene (I know, it’s getting ridiculous):Okay, enough from me, I’m just rambling now.  “It's hard to enjoy practical jokes when your whole life feels like one.” 4.5 stars!!
