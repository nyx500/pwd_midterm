I finished this with a smile. After finishing The Battle of the Labyrinth I had no doubt that I would love the last one. Why specifically I knew this, I have no idea. But I was right and I'm happy when I'm right. I was surprised that most of the book is set in New York City but it actually makes sense since Mount Olympus is above the Empire State Building. I liked this book so much for the same reasons that I liked the other books. It was so funny. The part with the peanut butter had me laughing out loud. The characters are adorable. Percy, Annabeth, Grover and Tyson are so sweet. However, don't expect a whole lot of mushy stuff it's mostly action and action. This one has the most of the series. Compared to the other Percy Jackson books this one was a bit less chipper because of all the problems but Percy takes it in stride for the most part. It is in no way a downer book. It's so good to finally know everything, and Percy is a lot smarter. After finishing the book I thought of how great Percy is, hands down the best demigod. Hercules who?Riordan is such a sly author too. He put in another prophecy in the end for another series. So now we just have to see how that might turn out. Okay so maybe you don't have to know but I want to.
