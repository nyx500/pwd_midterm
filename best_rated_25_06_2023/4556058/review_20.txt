#1 The Lightning Thief ★★★★☆#2 The Sea of Monsters ★★★★☆#3 The Titan’s Curse ★★★★☆#4 The Battle of the Labyrinth ★★★★★#5 The Last Olympian ★★★★★Wow, I can't believe this series is over! I thought it was an amazing close to this part of Percy's adventure but I'm also SO HAPPY that I have another series to look forward to with these characters (and some new ones, I'm sure). Buddy read with Sylwia!
