Check out my YouTube channel where I show my instant reactions upon finishing reading fantasy books.This is a fantastic fantasy novel that I happily can say is in my "top 10".I loved everything about this book. The characters are wonderfully written, the world is thoroughly enjoyable (even though it's on a very small scale), the plot is extremely engaging, the twists are exciting and shocking, and the ending is fantastic.This is also one of the rare books where the audiobook version is just as good, if not better than the physical book. The narrator does an absolutely perfect job at voicing these characters.This is a must-read for any fantasy fan.
