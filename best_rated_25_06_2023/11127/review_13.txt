"Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight. At the sound of his roar, sorrow will be no more. When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death. And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again."   The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Prince Caspian:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨ The Voyage of the Dawn Treader:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️✨ The Silver Chair:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✨ The Horse and His Boy:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The Magician's Nephew:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️✨ The Last Battle:  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The Chronicles of Narnia  will forever have an especial place in my heart. Narnia is a magical place that feels me with warmth and dreams, hope and wishes. Just thinking about it brings a smile to my face.  "Once a King in Narnia, always a King in Narnia."   I haven't read these books in many years and, in a way, it felt like rediscovering and meeting the world for the first time. It was like coming back home after a long while traveling, comforting and comfortable. But it also brought a new sight to my eyes respecting them.I love how the story-telling employed by Lewis how it was very simple, yet you could always picture everything perfectly. Though sometimes it became a little too specific in areas that would have done well with just a quick mention. This I especially found in  Prince Caspian  and  The Voyage of the Dawn Treader  where descriptions could go on for forever. Still, most of the time, the narrative is engrossing and simple and fast.Of course, we can't forget the beautiful characters! I love them so much, especially Edmund!!! I would get so excited whenever a mention of any of the Pevensies came out. I love them so much (except Susan) I can't even.  “It is very true,” said Edmund. “But even a traitor may mend. I have known one that did.”  What else can I say? Let me see... Oh, yeah! I can talk about my favorite book.Surprisingly enough -at least for me- it turns out that that place is occupied by  The Horse and His Boy,  something I was NOT expecting at all. I think it has something to do with the fact that it fills, a little, that big, empty space where I wish there was a novel about the golden age of Narnia. Of course, that's just a part of it. The book really captured me in its own right and can safely say I love it.  The Horse and His Boy  is closely followed by  The Last Battle  and  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,  obviously.  "All get what they want; they do not always like it."  I may add that this collection also has a bit of extra information, right at the end, that added that perfect touch. And helped filled any voids or questions I had respecting the history, timeline, or creatures of Narnia. Really appreciated._________________________________And I'm finally,  finally,  done with my first read of the year!!! Let the music blast people, life is getting back on track. RTC. __________________________________So a funny story with this one:It appeared on my currently-reading shelf, though I was most certainly NOT reading it. Here is what happened.My brother and I share the kindle account, which apparently is connected to my Goodreads account - who knew? - so when he opened it to check it out, it immediately updated. Ugh, so frustrating, especially since it's not the first time it happens.I am planning to read it soon though!
