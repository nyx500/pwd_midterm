The fun continues!!!I give a high rating due to its page turning storytelling, dark humour, fight/battle scenes, and characters. Especially characters! There are new interesting characters made first appearance on this book. For example Nicomo Cosca and Caul Shivers. They will have more important roles on Best Served Cold. You'll love Cosca although he is an unreliable drunkard. But as book two of a trilogy serial, the plots are still far from finish. At least some questions/mysteries from book one are answered on this book.
