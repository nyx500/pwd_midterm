Well, let's be realistic about it, this book is awesome! Disgusting, bloody, violent, hard, gritty, showing no mercy to anyone, murderous and hope shredding... And yet, it is addictive and leaves you craving your next dose!!! I am filled with adrenaline from reading it, but there are no rainbows and comfort foods on my mind. I want some relief from the darkness and despair, but the only way to get it is by getting the next book and annihilating it - no other way!!!
