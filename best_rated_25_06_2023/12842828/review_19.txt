3.5 stars, personally. This was a really interesting concept! I've been hearing about these books for a while and thought I would try at least the first book out once the last book releases as I was expecting cliffhangers galore, but you see how well that worked out. ðŸ˜‰ I really liked Sophie and how the Choice One trop played into this plot. I'm honestly shocked to say that because I had low hopes, but I really did like her. (I also wanted to give her a hug many times, the poor thing. A couple parts even bought tears to my emotionally-drained eyes.) She handled everything that was thrown at her very well and I honestly think the Council was too much of a stick-in-the-mud because I understood her reasoning every time. I really wanted answers about Sophie's past/beginnings, but the book ended with much more information than I was expecting. Not a lot, but more than I was hoping. I do think this series is going to drag out answers, which makes me less than excited to continue on, but I do plan to continue it, regardless. I know there's a big debate in this fandom about Fitz and Keefe. I don't have an opinion yet, personally. I'll keep y'all updated when I do. ðŸ˜‰ I would consider this to be upper Middle-Grade as there is a lot about crushes and boys and such. Overall? You know, it wasn't bad. I see why so many love it, though I'm concerned about this series being ten books as I'm not sure how much can happen (I feel like those who have read all the books out are laughing at me saying that) but I'll try out a couple more to see.

I believe that doctor was a member of [a group]--posing as a human--and that he implanted your mother with your embryo to keep us from knowing about [you]".Magic wise, it's said that what elves can do is not magic, Fits explains that "magic is a stupid idea humans came up with to try to explain things they couldn't understand"; There are special abilities like Telepath, Telekinesis, Inflicting (make someone feel certain things), & Mesmer (who can put someone in a trance) to name a few; By a certain age, the children elves are expected to "manifest" their special ability; There are Goblins, orges, imps, banshees, dinosaurs/tyrannosaurus, saber-tooth tigers, mammoths, and other hybrid odd animals (but no mentions of evolution) (all of the animals are trained to be vegetarian); A mention of someone being like a Titan god.
