3.5 Silver Starswith Golden SparksI actually was very afraid to start this book, thinking of it same as the Mortal Engines (I guess same cover vibes, it looks like a locomotive from distance), but NOTHING, absolutely Nothing similar. this one was so much more intriguing, since the first page!I wonder maybe this kind of story was the thing I expected from Artemis Fowl. same fairy vibes I guess.It was one of my most anticipated series & I'm glad, even in near 30, this middle grade didn't disappoint me. such a good feeling!Sophie meets Fitz (strange name, right!? you'll see) & her world changes completely.she even had the chance to see real dinosaurs, or some other strange & cute creatures in this new world, where she actually felt she belonged, new rules, new stuff, she should forget what she learned with humans so she could learn the actual rules of the nature.Light leaping!glittering away!Telepathy & other cool talents!Alchemy!New creatures!a whole new world.with Elves & goblins & gnomes!Quick, Cute & Fun read.not so childish.exciting! Intriguing! all the plots in history!all her unintentional troublemakings! (oh, my favourite, the Splotch!)it dragged me in & I kept reading & didn't notice the pass of time (or like I read 7 chapters at one setting!) every chapter had something to say.the ending was exciting (though I was kind of disappointed at one tiny point) but I wondered, second POV character would've been nice too in all describing the darkness! someone like my sweet boy Fitz!I liked Keefe & his teasing mode! also when he understood it was not the time for teasing, I liked him even more.I liked Sophie. though she was a bit too nervous, but a good girl & realistic character. & in the end, she had such a character development, I cheered for her.Dex was cute.I liked Alden, Tiergan, Grady, Della & many more. & Iggy!& of course there were some annoying characters too. (*cough* Stina! *cough*) I hated her!writing style was fun & cute.& the world building was beautiful & magnificent.I want to go to Foxfire & Everglen & Eternalia!-Plot: ★★★(★)/5(Excitements: ★★★★/5, Pace: ★★★★/5)Characters: ★★★★/5Written style: ★★★★/5World building: ★★★★/5Idea: ★★★(★)/5
