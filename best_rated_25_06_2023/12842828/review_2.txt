🌟Ridiculously good! I love it. And I imagine I would have been even more head-over-the-heels, had I gotten this one to read as a kid. Still, even for an adult, this is an immensely entertaining read. Complete with a new world, tidy loose endings wrapped up, likable protagonists, Harry-Potteresque schools... And Telepaths, Mesmers, Inflicters, Washers, Descryers, Atlantis, Exilium, Eternalia, Foxfire, prodigies, talent-based nobility, Dames and Sirs, society that had no death (almost!), Slurps and Burps (!), Moonlarks or suldreen), meganeuras, dwarves and knomes, and, of course, elves... Gosh!There are some influences and analogues https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_P... and I love it. Duh! I loved HP books and a lot of the other analogues that could be traced and I'm positively enamoured with the KLC series.

(c)Q:Garwin was still bitter Yale had offered her a full scholarship. His rejection letter had arrived a few weeks before. Not that Sophie was allowed to go.

(c)Q:It was so quiet there, just the gentle breeze brushing her face and the soft murmur of the river. No traffic, no chatter, no hammering, unspoken thoughts. She could get very used to the silence. But it felt strange, too. Like something was missing. (c)Q:“Laws are rarely broken.”Well, that was different. Humans broke the law all the time. (c)Q:… Haven’t you heard of the theory of relativity?” … “That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. Who came up with that?” (c)Q:“Humans do the best they can—but their minds can’t begin to comprehend the complexities of reality.” (c)Q:Other babies learned to walk. You learned to pace. (c)Q:“How long do elves live?” ...“We don’t know,”… “No one’s died of old age yet.” (c)Q:“You seriously expect me to jump?” “I can push you if you’d prefer.” (c)Q:Humans are always doing crazy, dangerous things. If they’re not lighting something on fire, they’re spilling oil in the ocean or blowing something up. (c)Q:“You can see my cells?”“Of course. Did you think I was wearing these glasses because they make me look dashing?” (c)Q:Grady and Edaline train the animals to be vegetarians by feeding them gnomish produce; that way they won’t hunt one another once they’re moved to the Sanctuary.”Another roar interrupted their conversation.

(c)Q:“A gnome ran in during breakfast and yelled something about a manticore stinging a stegosaurus, and they both ran off.” “And people say my parents are weird.” (c)Q:If she was good for them, maybe they’d want to keep her. (c)Q:“If you weren’t so obviously alive, I would assume I was probing a dead mind.” (c)Q:“Don’t mind Bullhorn,” Elwin said as Sophie backed against the door. “He’s harmless.”Bullhorn looked like a demented ferret with beady purple eyes. “What is he?”“A banshee. Adorable, isn’t he?” (c)Q:Lady Anwen told her in multispeciesial studies that she hadn’t laughed so hard in 324 years. (c)Q:“Your concentration controls how you use the energy—where you send it, how much you send. But the actual energy and strength comes from your core. Don’t you feel the pull in your gut when you draw on it?” (с)Q:Potential is nothing if it’s never lived up to, now is it? (c)Q:Dex had been nagging her for months to try an elixir he invented called Nogginease, which contained limbium, a rare mineral that could supposedly clear her mind. She’d resisted, since she couldn’t use it during the exams, but maybe it was like learning to ride a bike. She needed training wheels to start.
