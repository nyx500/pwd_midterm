It was absolutely delightful to dive into the world of Sophie Foster, a twelve-year-old girl, who discovers that she is an elf with extraordinary skills such as reading minds! Portrayed as a strong character, Sophie was immediately close to my heart. Growing up in the world of humans and transported to the "lost cities" to live with fellow elves, Sophie proves that she has a distinctive ability to show love and empathy as opposed to her new surrounding. Attending the Firefox elvin academy to hone her skills, she will come across well-developed, funny characters - some of them with rough edges, some of them with divine commitment towards her. Sophie is also exposed to the dangers set by the main antagonist Black Swan, who planted her in the human world in the first place. However, she masters the challenges to the reader´s utmost satisfaction, whilst she confronts the existing rules and ethics turning the elves´ business-as-usual world upside down. „Keeper of the Lost Cities“ is Shannon Messenger´s debut novel. The series comprises ten books altogether. If you feel like waking up to an incredible sunrise painted in pink, violet and orange merging the glowing stripes with the ocean into a fantastic reflection and go on a fantasy-adventure ride with Sophie Foster, this book is for you!#Netgalley 🙏#HonestReview 📚
