ALL KINDS OF AWESOME. Seriously am in love with this book/series and its characters. KEEPER OF THE LOST CITIES is a fantasy mystery of epic proportions--and it's captivating from page one.While it's perfectly fitted for middle grade readers (even reluctant readers will burn through this and beg for more!) I have to be honest and say that I don't read very much middle grade. But I'm 31, and this book is still one of my all-time favorites. The reach of KEEPER OF THE LOST CITIES extends from those middle grade readers all the way to adults of any age. Try it, you'll see what I mean.The characters are each fully developed and completely lovable--even (especially) the troublemakers. The pages are full of intrigue and twists and mystery--all while Sophie Foster (the main character) struggles to find her place in her new world. The setting is lush, the creatures are awesome--and just as lovable as the characters, and the bad guys are pretty freaking scary.If you only read one book for the rest of the year, MAKE IT THIS ONE!!! You'll be thanking me after.
