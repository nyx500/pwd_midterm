“This is…magic?”Fitz laughed – a full body laugh, like it was the funniest thing he’d ever heard [...] “No,” he said when he’d regained control. “Magic is a stupid idea humans came up with to try to explain things they couldn’t understand.” This. Was. So. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!From the first sentence, I knew this book was going to be captivating, fast-paced, marvelous, a whimsical magical adventure!!! We immediately get catapulted into action, and we barely have taken our first breath that we get thrown so many different kinds of magic, creatures, fantastical landscapes - practically all fantasy tropes, themes and characters in one - and oh my goodness gracious A MAGIC SCHOOL!Like this book was almost too much. Like think about all the things in literally all the fantasy books ever and you get this book. There is telepathy, vanishing, mythical creatures, underwater cities, freaking dinosaurs, goblins and, of course, elves. What more can you ask for? Oh yeah, I forgot A FREAKING MAGIC SCHOOL!So yeah, if you want to read a middle grade book that makes you ask yourself: isn't this a little bit too much goodness? Look no further, because man this was INTENSE! Can't wait to read number too.
