Alright, I will start this off by saying that this book was written by my little sister....and for you to fully understand what this means I must explain a few things to you. Shannon has always been the over achiever in the family, she's younger than me, yet managed to graduate a couple days before me, 4.0 and valedictorian no less! She graduated college, which I never even went to, and she always manages to do things like change the lightbulbs, wear accessories and eyeliner, and bring a jacket (whereas I am hopeless in all these departments!=)) So when Shannon FINALLY let me read her book, I knew it would be good.....There was a tiny part of me though that didn't want to like it.....because...COME ON, she can't really be good at everything can she?? Well any hope I had of not liking it was gone by around page 50.....I was hooked, so hooked in fact that my noisy animals distracting me from my reading proved to be too much! So I got in my car and drove to the beach and spent all day sitting on the sand until I finished all 400 plus pages of it. It was good, really good. I won't go into the story, because it's hard to explain it, but it is really genuinely beautiful. It's witty and sharp and obviously extremely engrossing. The world that my sister has created here is pretty much, for lack of a better word (see I told you she is the smart one!) awesome. I can see why there is so much buzz building up for the release of this one! So all I have to say to everyone else is that you should pick up a copy just as soon as you can.....and to Shannon I can only tip my imaginary hat (I'm not nearly good enough with accessories to have a real hat!) and say good job little sister, you are clearly going to be a big success! PS....remember the little people when you do become a success.....Like when you are doing casting for the male actors in the movie that will undoubtably be made from this.....remember me....and my excellent spectating skills!=)
