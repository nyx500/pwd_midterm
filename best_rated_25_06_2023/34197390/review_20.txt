5 star read easily (also, ALL THE STARS for being exactly what I needed when I was home sick).This was such a brilliant read from start to finish, and I really loved how different the "fighting" was from all the previous Tortall books that I'd read. The guerrilla were such a brilliant and unique take on things after having two main characters that were knights (...or trainee knights), and one that was a magic user that was still very upfront about everything. Having a main character in this duology that prefers to stay in the shadows and work as more of a spy and saboteur than as a warrior was such a refreshing change of pace that I had no idea I needed until I read this and Trickster's Choice. The relationships between all the different characters in this novel were so incredibly well done, from Aly becoming "boss-lady" and essentially a mother to all her spies, to Nuritin essentially being McGonagall, to Dove being what seemed like a trainee spymaster, to Nawat and Aly being PERFECTIONProbably my only gripe with this book is that both Dunevon and Elsren died - and they never found Elsren's body ;u; but that's more of a personal issue than any issue with the writing - I mean the death of two innocent little boys so that the regents could assume power of the country? It makes sense but it makes me SO FREAKING MAD.I am so unbelievably happy though that Aly was able to achieve her dream and become a spymaster, even if it isn't for Tortall. I can imagine that would make for a LOT of friendly "competition" between the spies of Tortall and the Copper isles. And I would 100% read a novella of Aly vs. George as spymasters trying to one-up the other ;DHonestly, that was just such a satisfying book from beginning to end with the exception of the deaths of Dunevon and Elsren at least and it was exactly what I needed when sick. ALL THE STARS for this book <3
