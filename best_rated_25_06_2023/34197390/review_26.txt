Rating: 5 / 5What I found lacking in action in Trickster's Choice is more than ample in Trickster's Queen, thereby earning this book a well-deserved five stars!Continuing Aly's story a couple of months after the end of the events in the last book, Pierce makes the smart choice of bringing our crew in the capitol, Rajmuat, right from the get go. Set against this sprawling seaside city, Aly's got new challenges ahead to get the revolution well underway. Still faithful to her role as spymaster, every one of Aly's actions are further her developments from the last novel, in which she's making preparations, gathering info, the works.Only this time, there's a lot of action-based things happening as well, and far higher stakes as intrigues are set against the two ruthless regents who have taken over the throne.Basically, what I loved about this novel is everything that I loved about the first novel, and what made it perfect is the complimentary schemes and steps forward alongside Aly's general spying. It's not just preparation for danger this time, but it's meeting that danger head-on and sidestepping it to get to an ultimate goal. I truly felt that both Aly (and Pierce) deserved a round of applause for this one, culminating in a highly satisfying and sweet ending.Loved it!
