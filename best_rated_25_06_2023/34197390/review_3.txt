Tamora Pierce was part of my literary diet when I was growing up. The combination of Western fantasy with Western science fiction means that even now I picture the fantasy city with wide boulevards, low-gabled houses, and amber sunlight dappling the warm streets.Malheureusement, growing up one comes to perceive the limitations of such a treatment of the genre.Trickster’s Queen, then, is a painful reread because I approach it this time with a new clarity of vision. It is a story, essentially, about colonialism.I mentioned to a friend how the Daughter of the Lioness stories distinctly map onto the USAmerican presence in the Philippines.Pierce’s Tortall is a place where dogs are trained in Malay, after all – if Pierce can come up with faux-foreign vocabulary for all the other regions of her world, I find it shameless to simply grab Malay wholesale.But, to return to this book: in Trickster’s Queen, the white woman convinces the indigenous peoples to support a mestizo regime because she and only she knows what will save them. She is kingmaker, power-broker, saviour all in one. In the Trickster’s Queen universe, this is unquestionably a righteous happening; Aly is vindicated by the appearance of demigods who hail her for her political and military intervention in the Copper Isles.I find it remarkable how the parallel of the novel’s plot with historical and contemporary USAmerican influences in Southeast Asia could fail to escape readers. The book’s and author’s politics – Pierce has written, for example, short stories whose plot boils down to ‘save the niqabis from themselves’ – are distasteful enough that, if I ever have a nostalgic craving for the Summersea quartets, it’ll be heigh ho, heigh ho to the library instead.
