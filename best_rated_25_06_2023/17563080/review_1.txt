Murder of Crows picks up right after Written in Red ends. The drugs "Go Over Wolf" and "feel good" are being distributed again. This time the targets are the Crowgard.Don't mess with my Crows! They can't help if they can't resist the shiny!Once things start taking a bad turn between the humans and "the Others" Simon and his crew finally figure out what the drugs are being manufactured from. These books do move slowly..there is a whole lot of buildup to the action sequences, but there is so many different characters that I realized the story wouldn't make as much sense if Bishop didn't do it this way. Don't be thinking that just because it has a crap load of characters that it gets confusing. It doesn't. It makes you so attached to these characters that you see them as real.I did want more of my favorite character Tess: Can she please have a book all to her own? She wasn't in this one as much and I'm disappointed.One thing that amazes me about these books is that the romance still isn't sizzling. I LOVE that. It's slowly building but that makes it believable. I wish all the rest of these authors would take note on this. Meg is slowly coming into her own and she is a human that might just get involved with a hottie wolf. So you can't just jump into that stuff. You might get bit.
