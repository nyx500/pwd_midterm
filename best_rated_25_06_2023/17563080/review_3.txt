This is just a mini review =) I didn't love this one as much as the first one but I still loved it. The world that Anne Bishop created is awesome! I love all of the creatures that live together and rule so many things in the world. Meg is back to seeing prophecies, uh, through the way she does. There is someone poisoning the crows and of course this doesn't sit well with the Others so they are going to start taking things away from the humans. We get to find out more from one of the other cassandra sange like Meg. She is one that is still kept asa prisoner for her prophecies. A good thing did come out of that though. There is some weirdo out there cutting up people and vampires so that's a load of fun. Not! I wonder what Anne Bishop has in store for us in the other books. Btw, I wish Meg and Simon would just get it on before they drive me crazy!!
