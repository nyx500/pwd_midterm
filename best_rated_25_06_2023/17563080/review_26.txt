I liked the first one way more than this one, which was low on action, repetitive on character development and repetitive on writing (seriously there were a lot of lines that were copied and pasted throughout, essentially). There's still a pretty interesting overall world concept and sometimes she does say things that intrigue me, but they tend to not get explored. I also think that her treatment of sex and romance is infantile in a way that only sort of makes sense sometimes- this is not the twelve year old protagonist of Daughter of the Blood, but she is sometimes treated that way. (Yeah, I know she was shut away, and it still doesn't 100% make sense, especially given what's happened since she's been out.) In addition, Bishop wants to protect her characters so much and so anxiously that I started to be able to skip sections because I knew nothing was going to happen. It's sort of sweet and something I would like to write about in a write up of the whole series, but can also get tiresome.I'm still going to read the next one in the hope that it gets better again. I still want to know what happens, and I'm still pretty invested in a couple of the main characters and in the world itself.
