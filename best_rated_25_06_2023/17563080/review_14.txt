The Sanguinati referred to females like Meg as sweet blood because, even when they were adults, these women retained the sweetness of a childâ€™s heart. Another 5 star rating. I can't put these books down for any reason. Eating and sleeping has become secondary. But who cares? Less sleep----> more reading!These books are so goood, exactly what I expected for a dark UF to be, it has all the elements to rock this genre. A lot happens. There are new characters introduced, old characters development, Meg helping and other things that I don't want to spoil. In the meantime,I would like some cassandra sangue euphoria.....And Simon to be there, of course. >.<
