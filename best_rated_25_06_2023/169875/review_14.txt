After loving 'Dealing with Dragons' for so long, I was really disappointed with myself for not finishing the series. I decided to remedy the situation. Unfortunately, I was not NEARLY as pleased with the 2nd book in the series as I was the 1st. Searching for Dragons is a follow-up of Cimorene, and the Dragon King Kazul. However, Kazul has been missing for days and no one has any leads. Suspecting the ever sneaky wizards, Cimorene decides to take matters into her own hands and find Kazul. However, she is met with more than she expects when Mendenbar, the King of the Enchanted Forest shows up on her doorstep to help. The story follows their adventure as they search for Kazul and encounter helpful, and un-helpful, characters along the way.Here's the problem. It's boring. There's none of the humor or silliness of the first book. The 1st book was so unique and intriguing, while this is just, well, there. And also, Mendenbar is badly written. He is introduced at the very beginning of the book, but I thought he was a jerk the whole time. It wasn't until 5 or 6 chapters in did I realize he's the hero of the story, and we're supposed to be a fan of his. D'oh.I'll keep reading the series, just to see how it all ends, and if it gets better. And I'll even read these stories to my kids. But this no where touches the original.
