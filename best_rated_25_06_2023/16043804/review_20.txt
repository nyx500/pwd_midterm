The Crown Tower is the first book in the The Riyria Chronicles which is the prequel series to Michael J. Sullivan's highly entertaining Riyria Revelations series. The Crown Tower was just as good as any of the books in the Riyria Revelations. It was packed with all the action, adventure, intrigue, and the humor readers of the Riyria Revelations have come to expect from a book featuring Hadrain and Royce. This was set 12 years before the start of the events told in The Crown Conspiracy. It was the story of how Hadrian and Royce first met and became the team known as Riyria. Arcadius manages to manipulate both Royce and Hadrian into stealing a forbidden book from the Crown Tower, a church stronghold, for him. I loved the fact that Royce and Hadrian did not become instant friends. They grew to trust and like each other over the course of the story. Their banter was as hilarious as ever even when it was not so friendly. This book also added Gwen as a POV character. We learn a bit more about her gift and her life. All to good effect. I like her a lot better now that I know more about her. The story of her time in Medford was dark, but interesting.While this book was still a fun and exciting read, it was a little darker than the original series. Royce was just as wild in his early days as all those stories promised he would be and Gwen's own story was a bit bleak at times! Rating: 4.5 stars.Audio Note: Michael J. Sullivan made a sacrifice to retain the services of Tim Gerard Reynolds as narrator and it was worth it. Reynolds is the voice of Hadrian and Royce, for me. He was fantastic again in this one.
