''The Riyria Revelations'' is my favorite series and reading it I always wondered how did Royce and Hadrian met so I was very excited to read this book.In my experience prequels aren't usually done right and they somewhat diminish that awesome feeling you got from the original so I was hoping this would be a good origin story and I'm glad it delivered. This book made me love Royce and Hadrian even more, I loved how they hated each other when they met because as a result their conversations, or more accurately, their bickering was hilarious. Another reason why their initial animosity was so fun for me is because my best friend and me were the same when we first met.The story mostly follows Hadrian through his POV and it was a bit slow paced until he reached Sheridan and had a meeting with Arcadius. I won't give away any spoilers but I'l just say that from that moment everything was just pure fun.Another character from Revelations that got more ''screen time'' was Gwen. Through her chapters we follow her rise from the bottom and we find out how she became The Lady of the House Medford. Those chapters were a bit dark and gruesome but I enjoyed them nevertheless. Gwen is an excellent example of a strong female character.I would have loved to read more about Royce and his adventures with the Black Diamond and his time in the Manzant prison but I was very much satisfied with his part in this story.I loved the ending of this book and the way everything fit together and I can't wait to read the next one.
