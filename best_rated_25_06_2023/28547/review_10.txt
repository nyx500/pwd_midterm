Following this very nice story, our dear Menolly is in the best place to fulfill her dream of becoming a musician. In this music school she meets all the people who can help her to show off her talent but also others who are putting obstacles and competing her. In this world full of opportunities and challenges, she is having difficulties to adapt, but with the help of her little wingers friends have all the resources to succeed while discovering that what she can offer is not just music.All this in a book that may not have the emotional intensity of the previous one - although the touching moments are not missing - but it is interesting, as it deepens even more the character of Menolly and in the Pern society. This and the optimistic tone makes this book particularly pleasant, a very good continuation before the end of this story.
