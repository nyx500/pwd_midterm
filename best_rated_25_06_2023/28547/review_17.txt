This sequel was hot and cold for me.I ADORED everything about the fire lizards, but they could not redeem this story for me. The persecution our girl Mennoly faced in Book 1 was unnecessarily recycled here. I guess the author just wasn't done grinding that axe... And then the ending was ludicrous in how abruptly she gains recognition, admiration, competency and a hero's mission. Sloppy.The fire lizards deserved better. 🐉🦎🐊***GR Personal Rating System:★★★★★ 5 Stars ~ LOVED ★★★★☆ 4 Stars ~ ENJOYED★★★☆☆ 3 Stars ~ LIKED ★★☆☆☆ 2 Stars ~ MEH★☆☆☆☆ 1 Star ~ NOPE
