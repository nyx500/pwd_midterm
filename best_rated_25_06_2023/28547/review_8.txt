This is a continuation of the previous book Drangonsong, and on this re-read I read them sequentially, though when I first discovered these books I did not have that luxury. Though it helps to have read Drangonsong first, McCaffrey comes from the generation of authors where you did NOT publish a book that could not stand on its own (a talent that as a society, we seem to have, MOST regrettably, lost), so it is quite possible to read this book as a standalone.Menolly has been brought to the Harper Hold, her ability with her nine fire-lizards brought her to the attention of The Master Harper and then he discovered she was the 'lost' apprentice from her hold, who had written those amazing songs that everyone wants more of.The child prodigy is an eternal prototype in fiction, here McCaffrey shows everyone how to do it best: Menolly has to overcome her background to allow herself to mature, fit in, learn and take her proper place in the Harper Hold. I found it delightful reading, even better re-reading and in many ways a better storyline than the book which immediately precedes it.
