Omg I loved this sm!! 😍😍😍 I was expecting great things after loving Legendborn and Tracy Deonn did not disappoint- such an amazing, well-written story that I thoroughly enjoyed!! 💗💗“But grief isn’t a competition. It’s not an identical pain that we all meet one day when death finds us. It’s a monster, personalized by our love and memories to devour us just so. Grief is suffering, tailored.”Bloodmarked is the sequel to Legendborn, which was one of my faves of last year- so so good!! I'm not gonna say much about the plot of this one to avoid spoilers but we basically continue to follow our mc Bree as she learns more about her ancestors and heritage and we also get loads of new info about some of our side characters! With war on the horizon, Bree and her friends will have to do everything to fight back the forces surrounding them and survive.“But that’s the thing. The Legendborn legacy isn’t power; it’s violence.”I'm always a little nervous going into a sequel of a book i loved bc of the dreaded second book syndrome- but this didn't have that at all!! 🥳 We get to learn sm more about the world & characters and imo it continues the momentum of the first book- which is amazing!! 🤩🤩Starting with the characters! ✨ I absolutely loved the characters in Legendborn and continued to love them in this!! 💗💗 Bree, our mc, is literally amazing- she's so fierce and refuses to back down, and her character development throughout the series has been done SO well. She feels like such a real person and i honestly would love to be her best friend ❤ The things she went through in this book tho-- 😭😭 I just wanted to give her a huge hug!! 🥺🥺🥺Sel is one of the biggest secondary characters in here and OMG I LOVE HIM SM 🤭🤭🤭 He's the dark, brooding bad boy kinda character, but that honestly never gets old 😏 Every time he protected Bree (which was a lot) I was swooning and his characterisation was *chefs kiss* He is literally so hot i can't get over it 🤭😍✨Other characters✨♤Nick didn't feature in this one as much so I don't have a lot to say about him. But some of the decisions he made were a little bit *questionable* 🤨🤨♤Alice- i love her sm 💗 Her and Bree's friendship is so precious and we got to see a lot more of her in this book which was great!! She's so snarky and I love it 🤌🤌♤Valec- he was a new character and I honestly don't know if we're meant to like him or not but I'm obsessed with him 🤭🤭 He's got that morally grey flair that I love sm and he's just sooo entertaining. Every scene with him in it had me giggling and smiling. We better see more of him!! 😍😍😍Next, the writing- which was absolutely IMMACULATE 😍😍🤌🤌 I love Tracy Deonn's writing SO MUCH and I honestly can't believe this is only her second book 😳 it is just so polished and beautiful. Something about the way she writes is so perfect to me and I NEED MORE 😫😫Also, there were quite a few tough topics talking about here, such as rape and racism, and I think the author handled them AMAZINGLY. She didn't shy away from showing us the ugly truth and how those horrible, horrible things had effected the characters so deeply and i think that she really understood the struggles she was talking about. So I really appreciated that 💗 But would definitely recommend checking trigger warnings for this series before picking it up. The plot was also really good!! 🤩🤩 This book was packed full of action and plot twists that had me GASPING and i was eating it up 🤭 We get to learn sm about the world in here which was super interesting and the characters also travel around a lot which was nice for a change of pace from the first book. That end part was literally so intense i was S T R E S S E D. I NEED THE NEXT BOOK. Like, rn 😤😤Lastly, the romance. OMG THE ROMANCE IN HERE. IT WAS TOO GOOD GUYS 🤭🤭😩😩 I am officially Team Sel, he and Bree are P E R F E C T for each other 🤌🤌 Every little interaction, every time Sel protected Bree, THE SCENE IN THE FOREST- I can't get over it I love them sm 💗💗💗 I was eating up that romance up, it was just *chefs kiss*“What truly ties us together is not blood but pain. When we love someone and lose them, that loss imprints itself on everyone else we love too.”Overall, I loved this sm!! 😍😍 Would absolutely recommend if you want:✔ Amazing writing✔ Such great characters✔ STUNNING ROMANCE✔ Lots of plot twists and actionTracy Deonn, you're gonna have to write the third book quickly bc I need it NOW 💗~ 4.5 stars!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This was so so good 😍😍😍 The romance was 🤌🤌 and I had such a good time reading it!! 💗💗 Also the ending was wild 😳😳RTC!
