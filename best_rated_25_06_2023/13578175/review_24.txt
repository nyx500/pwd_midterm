“There are . . . times when one must accept the aid of darkness in order to contain a greater darkness.”Brandon Sanderson's The Emperor's Soul is a short but wonderfully crafted and satisfying novella. Yet again, Sanderson provided a new system of magic that played out in interesting ways. What happens when you change the history of an object? It turns out that such a transformation can have huge consequences. Sanderson says the idea for this system came from ancient rulers putting their stamp on objects, what in Korean is called tojang. That seemed really fascinating to me. In addition to the magic system, I very much liked the main character, Shai. “There was rarely an obvious branching point in a person's life. People changed slowly, over time. You didn't take on step, then find yourself in a completely new location. You first took a little step off a path to avoid some rocks. For a while, you walked alongside the path, but then you wandered out a little way to step on softer soil. Then you stopped paying attention as you drifted farther and farther away. Finally, you found yourself in the wrong city, wondering why the signs on the roadway hadn't led you better.”
