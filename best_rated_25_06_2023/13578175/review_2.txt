What if you could create anything? Or more specifically, what if you could change the history of an object and essentially recreate what it believes it is?All you need is a little Titanium White...Ok. Maybe not. Shai is a Forger who got pinched by the Imperial po-po while trying to steal some of their shit, and now, in exchange for her freedom, she's been tasked with recreating the Emperor's Soul!Which, in case you were wondering is why the book is titled, The Emperor's Soul.Now, she's got to do this in secret because the dude's been left a vegetable due to a failed assassination attempt.Of course, creating (or recreating, in this case) a soul is next to impossible even if you had years to work on it, and Shai most certainly does not have years. She's got a few months before the Emperor's council needs to present him as hale and hearty to the other factions within the government who want to take over.So what's a girl to do? Well, that's one option.But Shai has other plans... This was a really good short story, and if Sanderson's other fantasy stuff is anything like this, then I can't wait to read more!
