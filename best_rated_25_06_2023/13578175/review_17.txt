Little wonder why this masterpiece novella won the Hugo Award, so beautifully written and delivered, this story speaks to your soul - pun entirely intended. Sanderson created yet again another imaginative magic system, Forgery, which is in short, imitation of the highest degree that requires a rewriting of history or memory of its target. And what could be more complicated and masterful than that of the forgery of a soul.He also gave us characters that are incredibly compelling (the relationship between Shai and Gaotana was simply wonderful) and injected emotion, tension and contemplation into a story which I can only describe as beautiful, all in under 200 pages. The magic system of Forgery was displayed to its fullest potential given the limited number of pages, but the essence of the story was not in the least compromised. One of my favourites from my favourite author. P/S: Do read the Postscript by the author :)
