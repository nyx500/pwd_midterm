Having quite enjoyed the first three volumes of this series, but got fatigued with the relentless in a tough reality even the good guys are kind of bad, I hadn't sought out the 4th and 5th volumes and had this on my TBR for years; so finally looking to get it off my list, I read it. No real difference than the other books in the series, sought of journey across lawless and savage lands in search of kidnapped children, and for most, gold. It brings back a number of characters from the earlier volumes; but proved a mostly boring read for me, despite being action packed and twist ridden, nothing felt new or innovative.Whilst reading I tried to think about what gets my goat about Abercrombie's pseudo-westerns and that's when it hit me, despite being written in the 21s century there's nothing new here, the 'savages' are discounted as footnotes; the 'cowboys' are underhand, selfish, sweary and mostly lack moral compass; and the 'good guys' are only a little bit better than the rest. Worse of all, the woman are only painted as heroic and/or interesting if the mimic male behaviours. The whole 'Grimdark' thing doesn't work for me at all to be honest, just feel s like repainting idealised interpretations of Western behaviour from the last few centuries, especially from the 'Wild West'. Just squeezes in a Two Star 4 out of 12 from me, for some of the well plotted combat scenes, an area where Abercrombie does excel.2023 read
