Bestest of the best of the best. I can't get over how much I loved this book. How does it work that what Joe likes to write is exactly what I like to read??This even beat out Best Served Cold, my standing favourite. And while I thought the sex scene there was one of the best ever written, and most stomach-turning, it turns out I was wrong. The one here was even more sickening and even more shockingly hilarious. Perfectly awful.Shy was an amazing lead woman, having Lamb around was heart-breakingly glorious, even a cameo by Caul Shivers, one of my favorites. But for me, Temple absolutely stole the show. Loved every second, every profession, every reversal in his conversations with God.I can't get enough of these books and basically spent the whole journey thinking how badly I need to reread the whole series. But now there's The Age of Madness... can't decide if I should reread before or after...just so good.
