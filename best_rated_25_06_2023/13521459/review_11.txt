4.5 stars. Not as good as Heroes or original trilogy but still one hell of a read.The trouble with running is wherever you run to, there you are.Wisely said by the man who tends to be realistic about those things and indeed it's one of the main sentiments of both this book and original trilogy.

As with all First law standalones we have new set of PoVs with some old faces like Nicomo Cosca and Bloody nine himself getting decent amount of screen time.
