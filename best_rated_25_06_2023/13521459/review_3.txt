4.5 stars. The best of the First Law singlesCheck out my new youtube channel where I show my instant reactions to reading fantasy books seconds after I finish the book.This book was pure enjoyment for me, in part due to how good it is written, and in part due to my lower expectations. I have not liked the First Law singles as much as the original trilogy, but this book hits very close to the quality of that trilogy.Cosca is an amazing character in this book and legitimately had me laughing out loud at how funny he is. I didn't enjoy him half as much in his previous times in this series as I did here. I also loved that "lamb" was in this book, even though it's obvious within the first few pages what his true identify is. I actually think his character would have been weakened if Abercrombie kept it a true surprise. His need for a new identity makes sense, while still being able to appreciate who he is. I also didn't realize how much I needed a fantasy western in my life. It seems obvious now that I think about it. I love westerns, and I love fantasy books. So mesh them together and you get quite the wonderful product.I couldn't quite justify giving this book 5 stars because it didn't have that "grand" scale that hit the highest of high marks that some of the first books in the series hit. But it's awfully close, and a must read for anyone who is either an Abercrombie fan, or a western fan.
