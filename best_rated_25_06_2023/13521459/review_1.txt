A somewhat Westernized setting for this fantasy set in Abercrombie's world. Very enjoyable to catch up with some character friends as well. And of whom or what they did, I shall say nothing! Read for yourself.One of the many things that Joe Abercrombie excels at is the character cameo. A turn of the page and the reader enters the point of view of what might seem a minor character. But in a space of the few paragraphs, the character takes on dimension, flesh, ambitions, a past, and a life. One can perceive that while we are eager to follow the tale of Lamb and Pit and Ro, this intersection shows us that every character inhabits a thread of story that is equally complex and possibly as compelling.An excellent read, even if it did intrude into my sleep time as a nightmare. The best stories are the ones that don't let go of your mind.
