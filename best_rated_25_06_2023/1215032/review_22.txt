I'm not angry at the hours spent reading a book that I'd rate 1 star. It was like an exercise in self-restraint and meditation. Having said that, it's sometimes useful to write negatively about 1 star books. I won't hide the fact that I was indeed exposed to substandard fare.Kvothe lost all the creed he had with me in book 1. Here he is nothing, either as Kvothe or as Kote. His adventures are insipid and he comes across as a huge boar. That's right. Don Quixote has more lucidity in his little finger than the entire bag of wind that is Kvothe.Take the reasons of why he isn't granted immediate honors by the Maer. The mind boggles. Then the Maer says, later, that third time pays for all. Is he a ruler or a fishmonger haggling for prices?The author had nothing up his sleeve. Unlike a good illusionist, Rothfuss really had nothing to show. Parts of the book are disjointed from others. Denna is a nitwit. The fact that her eyes twinkle doesn't mean she's mysterious. All characters are 2 dimensional and most are unlikable.I also couldn't care less for the world building. If you think the Adems's way of communication is original, you need to read more fantasy. The author keeps harping on the fact that the Adems, who view everyone else as barbaric are themselves set in their harsh ways. Can we move on from this banging of the empty barrel? like Asimov so nicely phrased.The book felt like an initially flashy car with cheap plastic lined inside. Patrick Rothfuss is out of ideas. Huge parts of the plot are glossed over, while entirely new arcs occur disruptively. I am now indifferent as to what happens next.
