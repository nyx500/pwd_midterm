Well, it's done. And it's been a long time coming... Back in late 2009 I finally got the book to the point where I was satisfied with it. It was an okay book. It was a book that if I had to publish it, I knew it wouldn't embarrass me. By May 2010 I'd re-written the book to the point where I was happy with it. It was a good book. It was a book I was pleased with. By my final deadline in November 2010, I'd revised things to the point where I was excited about it. It was a great book. It was finally a book I was proud of....I'm glad my editor gave me enough time for this. I'm glad I have a book I'm excited to have on the shelves. I hope when it comes out on March first, you enjoy it. It was a long time coming....
