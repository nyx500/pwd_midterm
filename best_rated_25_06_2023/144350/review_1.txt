I'm sorry. Did you hear that noise? No? Well it was the sound of my heart exploding in sadness. A sound that will never be heard again in all time. At the end I decided who I shipped, and then my heart exploded in two. Will + Evelyn belong together. And now I'm extremely disappointed and scared to see if they will belong together. With both of them stuck on either side of the fence. Will being he is no longer her status. Evelyn being Rangers always keep to themselves. And me sitting here just waiting for my heart to explode. Then it did.Now I cannot give a good review, and probably will never be able to. Just know that I have been silenced in the beautifully sad closure of this book. I fear their lives will never be the same again.
