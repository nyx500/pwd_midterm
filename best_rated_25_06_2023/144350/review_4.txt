Four solid stars. Told in 3rd person omniscient, there are only about 300 pages creating a swiftly flowing pace. (Long books wear me out). The plot is solid but not confusingly complex. The characters we met in earlier books return again, guarding each other's back, including Will, Horace, Evanlyn, Halt, Erak, etc. Their bond of friendship further develops, a spirit of camaraderie, loyalty, trust.This series is classified as fantasy, but there are no fantastical elements in this particular entry (except one scene with a berserker killing rage). It's really more like an alternative history, where English-typecast characters (from Araluen) help the battle-axe toting Skandians (Vikings) repel an invasion of mongol-type invaders from the Eastern Steppes (the Temujai), light-calvary-archers led by a Khan-type chieftain.It was written for teens, but I enjoyed it. There is maybe too much time spent on battle scenes, but the tactics were interesting and the fight did not feel overwhelming. Kudos to the author for creating credible (not Mary Sue) action scenes with the young princess, Evanlyn / Cassandra.There is a good map and a fun app at the author's website: http://www.worldofjohnflanagan.com/ra...
