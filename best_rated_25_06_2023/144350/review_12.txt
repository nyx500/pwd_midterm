I LOVE this series... but I still want to know what on earth went on between Halt and Lady Pauline! Agh, this has been frustrating me since I read the pre-series books. What went on between them?Also, I'm really sad that Cassandra and Will  even through all that they went through together they couldn't continue to be friends. I feel bad for poor Will. At least Cassandra has Horace, but Will... he's a Ranger. I'm guessing this is also something to do with why Halt and Lady Pauline had a... disagreement? I don't know, but somethingContent: Similar to the first books, this is totally fine for middle-grade and other than the fatalities of war there's not really any content.
