There are few books that manage such a level of consistency - and that's a compliment, though it doesn't sound really like one. Normally in a series there are some good books, some not so good ones, great characters, characters that piss you off... the Ranger's Apprentice series has had nothing but a consistently engaging plotline, an incredible cast of loveable and a fascinating setting. It hasn't gotten boring once.In this installment we get to know Erak more which I loved. Erak and Halt's dialogue was hilarious. It was also fascinating to learn more about the Skandians. While the battle was a little long-winded, I think it was key. It gave Evanlyn the chance to grow in her character. After seeing everyone else doubt her abilities - at times, she even doubted herself - it was nice to see her grow in confidence and wow everyone with her hidden awesomeness. I'm intrigued about her and Horace's relationship and how it is going to progress over the rest of the series! I have to admit that I missed Will a little bit though. He still isn't back to his usual self (for most of the book) and he got a little weird towards the end. Overall, this was fantastic - just as I've learnt to expect from John Flanagan. I'm excited for the next book.
