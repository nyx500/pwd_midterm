My feelings are so hard to quantify on this one! There are parts of this book that are SO lovely, SO emotional, and SO insightful into the human condition. But there are also parts that I really did not like, particularly the ending for Fitz. If this was the last I was going to see of these characters, I think I would be disappointed. But still, considering how often I cried in this, I clearly connected with this one pretty deeply, so 4 stars feels right
