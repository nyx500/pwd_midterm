Seven hells...what did I just read?üò±üê∫A Storm of Swords or as I call it the wedding book is by far the best book in the series ASOIAF!Long yes, but for those of you who have watched or heard about the series this book describes the events we have watched both in season 3 and 4 ! Though, I have to say I have read about things they never showed us in the series(YET?) and I'm not talking about about small details, I'm talking about major stuff...Well I can't say anymore without spoiling something..But the epilogue left me speechless!I couldn't find the full edition of the 3rd book so I bought part 1 and part 2. Due to their length it felt like reading 2 books so it was pretty obvious to me that the first part (abt 600 pages) was not so action-packed as I expected, so I gave it 4 stars. But boy, the second part was like 10 stars!Like I said there are a lot of weddings described in this book and I personally hate weddings but these were really something! Master Martin makes sure you will cry, laugh, even bite your nails while reading this book. I think I have said that before, but I really love the fact that each chapter is told through a different character each time so we get a deeper insight into our beloved heroes while viewing the events from their perspective! Jaime appears to be a major character now, there's a lot being narrated from his point of view, but if I am not mistaken this is Arya's book! Her journey becomes even more treacherous and difficult and strangely enough it seems that most of the events revolve around her. I best liked Tyrion, Bran and Jaime-Brienne chapters!I really don't know what else to say!!! I can't wait to get my hands on the next book! Fantasy lovers enjoy!!!
