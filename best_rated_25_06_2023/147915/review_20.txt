Without the distraction of the TV show I’ve promised myself to finally catch up with the rest of A Song of Ice and Fire.I really don’t know why I’ve been procrastinating so long as these books are amazing!Even though I’m aware of the game changing elements in this volume, GrrM’s layered writing with plenty of for shadowing is just incredible.I’m not the biggest fantasy reader but I love the characters and world he has created.For this volume I decided to limit myself to just a couple of POV’s a night and it certainly helped.Some character chapters that I’m usually not fussed about became far more interesting.I’ve gotten into a nice routine every evening that I now want to instantly grab the next one off the shelf.At this rate I might even be caught up before George releases the next book!
