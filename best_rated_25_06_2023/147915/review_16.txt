Possibly the most devastating, awesome, exciting and surprising instalment yet, and I'm starting to get a sneaking suspicion that the real story is only just starting...If you'd told me during the first book that by this point I would be pinning all of my hopes on The Hound and Jaime freaking Lannister, of all people, I'd have thought you were certifiable. But that would appear to be where we are at the moment, with Jaime in particular evolving into being one of the more interesting characters.Containing a ton of gruesome deaths it's now quite clear that absolutely no character is safe in this story, and I'm really enjoying being taken along on the remaining characters stories. I can only begin to imagine what may happen now with Arya possibly on her way to a reunion with Jaqen, Jon commanding the Wall and Tyrion having, awesomely, killed Tywin Lannister. Can't wait to find out...
