Oh my bloody hell and fuck...Dear George,I have read A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords one after another and in any spare moment over the last couple of months. As a result, I think that this reality is starting to take over. My emotional involvement in the lives of your characters is reaching an unhealthy depth, and your brutality with them is breaking my motherfucking heart. I just finished ASOS a moment ago, and said motherfucking heart is beating some serious drum and bass. I often do and recently have read books to love, admire, and learn from. But dang dawg, I don't remember the last time reading was so damn EXCITING. I have NO IDEA what you're going to do or where you're going to take me next - all bets are off, because your world is a real one, where heroes get savaged and baddies prevail and shit happens that leaves you staring at the heavens and thinking WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?You're MAD. A mad marvellous genius and I love you. But I kind of hate you. Because you are KILLING me and I am becoming an obsessed crazy person.Shattered but scintillated,Alex
