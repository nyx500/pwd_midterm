"Always keep your foes confused. If they are never certain who you are or what you want, they cannot know what you are like to do next."This book is pure genius. It made me wince in pain when a few of my favourite characters were murdered. It made me dizzy with joy when my most despised and hated character was murdered. And it made me feel all the little things in between during the whole span of A Storm of Swords."Weddings have become more perilous than battles, it would seem."I loved the way A Storm of Swords: Blood and Gold surprised me. I never expected people to die in the manner they did. I love the fact that even though so many people die it still hurts. George R.R. Martin makes me feel too many feels while reading. One moment I think the characters are safe and the tone is light and happy, and the next moment: everybody is dead.All men must die.One thing that I absolutely loved about this book was the character development! I learned a lot about the characters' backstories, intentions and true feelings. I started liking Jaime more and more as I continued reading. And Sandor Clegane as well."which is more dangerous, the dagger brandished by an enemy, or the hidden one pressed to your back by someone you never even see?"I love the way treachery is portrayed in the book. The reader is shown the intricate and delicate ways people can play the Game of Thrones. In A Storm of Swords I got a better insight on the way people try to manipulate and control each other to win the Game of Thrones. "Smoke, sweat, and shit. King's Landing, in short. If you have a good nose you can smell the treachery too."A Song of Ice and Fire (Book Reviews)1. A Game of Thrones: 5 Great First Stars2.
