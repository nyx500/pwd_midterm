Well the field is thinning out a bit. Martin has killed off a few of the main characters, even POV characters. He is also adding new POV characters on different sides and giving the “baddies” a platform too. All sides have a perspective and there is nuance in many of the characters that was less obvious at the beginning. The advantage of using thousands of pages to tell the story. There is plenty of treachery and deception and plenty of very good reasons for avoiding weddings. The morality is cruel and brutal, particularly in relation to sex and sexual relations. There is religion, more than one, although they are not quite as well developed as some other aspects of the culture. There’s been a bit of grumpiness about well-loved characters being killed off, particularly in relation to the Starks, but Martin seems to have no favourites. Winter is still coming!
