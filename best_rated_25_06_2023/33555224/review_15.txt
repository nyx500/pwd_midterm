Without context, the word Thunderhead could mean a variety of things; for instance, it sounds like it it might be:-the newest Scandinavian metal band-a kind of migraine-something you may overhear a group of college boys bragging about on the subway-a pagan shrine to Thor But stupid jokes aside, in Neal Shusterman's world Thunderhead is the ultimate cloud collection of human knowledge, given consciousness and the task of governing Earth. It is a benevolent ruler, having eradicated death, disease, crime, unhappiness and other generally unpleasant affairs. I am protector and pacifier, authority and helpmate. I am the sum of human knowledge, wisdom, experimentation, triumph, defeat, hope, and history. I know all that it is possible to know, and it is increasingly unbearable.Because I know next to nothing.The only thing beyond the Thunderhead's control is the scythedom, a body of around 12,000 individuals worldwide who murder by profession. This is the immortal world's solution to overpopulation. Thunderhead is a lot like Scythe, with a little more variety thrown in. Instead of following Citra and Rowan exclusively, there are now several new characters and viewpoints from which to experience the story. Most notably we're introduced to Greyson Tolliver, a regular young man who risks his future out of loyalty to the Thunderhead, the only parent he's ever known. Greyson gives a little fresh air to the story and stepped in when Citra and Rowan's plotlines became stale.Overall, the Arc of a Scythe series is no longer just a story about scythes, and the evolution is a definite improvement. I'm 100% psyched for the release of book 3 (whenever that may be).
