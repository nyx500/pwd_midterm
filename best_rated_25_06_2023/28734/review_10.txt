Thank goodness Lackey allows Vanyel a couple of moments of happiness in this last book in The Last Herald-mage trilogy. A couple of moments before whacking everything apart, that is, then going into some pretty dark places, making Vanyel's youthful horrible visions of a dark mage a reality.Again, the character writing is sensitive, and sad as the ending is, there is a tiny bit of hope there, too. And Yfandes is the best.
