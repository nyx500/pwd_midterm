I've loved this book for years. Yet it's been awhile since I've read this series and there are so many things I'd forgotten. And yet this still managed to rip my heart out and pull out the tears. I knew what was coming and my heart still broke for Vanyel. Vanyel has sacrificed so much of his life and energy for Valdemar and it's people. He's been so isolated and let's so few people in. I do love how Stef just worms his way into Vanyel's circle and refuses to leave. He's been determined to meet Vanyel for years and when the opportunity presents itself for his magic to help the king, he still takes his opportunity. He's the youngest bard to gain Master status ever, and his music is the medium to help, but no matter that he's now in contact with Vanyel only their friendship is progressing. Off course the danger to Vanyel and those he cares about is still as high as ever. Normally this type of rip your heart out story would destroy me and I'd never want to read it again. Yet I love Vanyel and Stefan so much. This story tugs at my heartstrings and will always have me coming back for more. The sacrifices both men have made for their country are epic. They spend more time apart then they ever have had together, but yet eternity is theirs.
