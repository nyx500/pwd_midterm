4.5 starsThis third book of The Last Herald-Mage trilogy was my favourite of the three, although I have to say I enjoyed all of them.Unlike many of my friends who read this series when they were much younger, and whose revisitations are now permanently elevated by nostalgia, this was a first reading for me. There is something eminently comfortable about these books, which provides even new readers like myself a sense of ease and satisfaction with the story.Among many things I liked about it was the casual inclusion of everyday affection and expressions of love between characters. The importance of close relationships, whether friendship or romantic, is integral to the story in a way that didnâ€™t feel forced, but is rather presented as a kind of ideal anyone would want in their lives. As much time is spent on feelings as on action, making it just the thing for a comfort read. The action is fraught with intensity, the targets emotional as well as physical, and the hurts equally of the spirit as well as the body. If you like your fantasy more technical, it won't be for you. But if you like exploration of the heart to be included in the journey, this is probably closer to your style.
