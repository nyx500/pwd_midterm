Okay, this was cool and all, but not as good as I expected it to be. Maybe I was too excited to read it and it had the opposite effect? I also think I should have reread HoEaB before I went into this because I sometimes couldn't remember who was who and to put myself in the right mood. I'll give it another try next month and review it properly then.ACTUAL RATINGS 3,5/5 __Not that I kept count or anything but I've been waiting for this for 348 days, 22 hours, 49 minutes and 54 seconds.I'm bookgasming.
