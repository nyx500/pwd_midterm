I FINISHED. IT’S DONE……MY MIND IS REELING AND I’M ABSOLUTELY SPEECHLESS. I definitely don’t have words right now, my brain is fried at how amazing this was. This book’s bar was set at sky high levels, and hands down my most anticipated book of 2022, or maybe ever. I was not disappointed in the slightest. I love this world & characters more than I thought possible. I’m even more obsessed than I was before.I saw part of the ending spoilers before the book was released, but it honestly didn’t even matter or take away from the ending as a whole. There were a million other things happening that were just as insane. I will be rereading this immediately. I need CC3 more than air. ———————HUNT ON THE COVER LIKE THE KING HE IS!!!WE FINALLY HAVE A TITLE & CONFIRMED RELEASE DATE!!!!!EDIT- March 2021: A few takeaways from the SJM IG livestream with Steph from Ideallyinspiredreviews:-CC2 should be out around March 2022 but there’s no official date. The tentative date on Goodreads for November 2021 is wrong-Sarah knows the title but can’t say it yet. The same cover artist who designed HoEaB will be doing CC2’s cover -Bryce & Hunt will be “very satisfied” sexually. (She said in a previous livestream it will rival the smut amount/steam level in ACOSF!)——-Me realizing there is absolutely no info about this whatsoever.......PLEASE let it be sooner than later that we get a cover, title, description, release date, literally anything...I NEED MY BABIES BACK
