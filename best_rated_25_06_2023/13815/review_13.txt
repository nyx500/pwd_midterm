Often in trilogies, there occurs what is known as the "second book" syndrome, where the universe is no longer shiny and new as it was in the first book, but not as exciting as the climatic third book, and mostly exists as a bridge between those two, providing important set-up, but not feeling as exciting. Servant of the Empire, I am glad to say, does not have this problem. Despite having crossed the first hurdles to her rule, Mara still has many threats to deal with, for while her position may have been made more secure, the situation has also become a great more complicated due to the enemies she made in securing that rule as well as sudden unexpected changes in the Great Game. Feist and Wurts do an excellent job both of drawing out the implications of Mara's actions in Daughter of the Empire, and of tying in the events of the book with that of the Riftwar Saga. As a result, the political intrigue and sense of urgency that characterised the first book is just as thick and exciting here, if not even more so. The romance is also well handled, and feels tumultuous, tangled, passionate, and real.My one gripe about this book is that ethics-wise, it felt a little too much like "Westerner comes to barbaric world and shows them the error of their ways, having a civilising effect on them". Mara's world-view and personal moral code changes drastically because of Kevin and his behaviour, yet there seems to be no reciprocal effect on Kevin by Mara. He loves her despite her flaws, and there is nothing redeeming portrayed about Tsurani culture that Kevin can take away. As a citizen of a country that was previously colonised, this felt personal and reminiscent enough of real life that I felt a little uncomfortable about it.All in all though, this is still an excellent book, and I enjoyed it immensely.
