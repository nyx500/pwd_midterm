I wanted to squeeze this one into 2022 as my last book of the year but had such a busy end to 2022, I didn’t get a chance to finish it until now. Raymond E Feist I’ve always considered a solid fantasy writer, and I’m pleased to say he and Janny Wurts delivered another exciting addition to the Riftwar Cycle.Set directly after the events of Daughter of the Empire, Mara has managed to outmanoeuvre both her cruel husband Buntokapi and sworn enemy Jingu of the Minwanabi. Her battles are far from over though as her enemies seek revenge on the Acoma for her victories.There were so many elements I enjoyed when reading Servant of the Empire. In particular the intrigue of The Imperial Court and Game of the Council, numerous bloody confrontations between the Acoma and their enemies, and Mara’s relationship with the barbarian Kevin of Midkemia.I think the characters from the first novel grew rapidly during book 2. Most notable among these were Keyoke and Nacoya, who both went through the mill this time. Mara herself is such a fantastic character and I was so pleased to see her in a better place throughout book 2, given she had such a rough ride in the first novel.A wonderful start to my 2023 reading challenge and I’m pleased to give Servant of the Empire a solid 4 stars. I’m not awarding it higher since I felt some of the sequences felt a little drawn out and think the novel could have been condensed by at least 100 pages or so. I’m very much looking forward to the conclusion of Mara’s journey in Mistress of the Empire, but for now it’s time for me to return to Scadrial with Brandon Sanderson.
