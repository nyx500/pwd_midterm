3.5 StarsServant of the Empire continued the Riftwar spinoff series started in Daughter of the Empire, and offered another fun and layered adventure set in the unique Tsurani world. Mara, now Ruling Lady of her house once more, has survived the first attack from rival houses. But there are always more threats on the horizon. This time, the threat may destroy not only her, but her entire house. Picking up where the first book left off, Servant of the Empire offered up more of the things that made the first book enjoyable. A unique culture, tense political intrigue, interesting and unique characters, all kinds of good stuff. We get to see more of the Tsurani world, which I enjoyed, as it broadened an already fascinating setting. There were also a number of events that tied in to the original Riftwar series, which as a huge fan of those books was a lot of fun to see. Despite all the good, I enjoyed this one a little less than the first one. This book was significantly longer, and at times the political machinations started to feel a little repetitive. There was also a strong romance element that I didn’t particularly enjoy. Though the Tsurani culture is wonderfully unique, there are times the attitudes toward slavery and the devaluation of human life. This last frustration is actually addressed through some of the developments in the book, but it still was a minor detraction. That said, it was still an entertaining and well written book, and I’m curious to see how the final volume in the trilogy concludes the story.
