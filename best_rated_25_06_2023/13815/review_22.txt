This fell into the second book slump as I like to call it. Good, but Mara is basically untouchable (I get the feeling that she is venturing ever further into Mary-sue territory). However is it executed quite nicely. There aren't as many crafty political maneuvers in comparison to the first book but it is still an entertaining read. I wasn't too fond of the introduction of Kevin and the role that he had in the book. The further along I got, the more I kept seeing aspects of "this is a savage and uneducated culture when compared to ours". The inklings of the "western culture/ideals vs everyone else = west is best" ruined a huge portion of the book for me. I can't recall the name of the trope but it is one that I am not particularly fond of. With Kevin  being sent back to his homeland  I hope that the last book does not continue in this direction.
