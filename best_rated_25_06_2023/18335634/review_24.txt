Honestly, I can't decide how should I rate this. It's definitely the best book in this series. There was pretty good action, however, I didn't like the way they finished the storyline with Mortmain. I liked Woolsey and wished there would be more of him. It was also pretty interesting to see how certain things linked to the things in TMI (e.g. Church, Jace's birthmark...)So, I think it's I would probably rate this somewhere around 3,5*.
