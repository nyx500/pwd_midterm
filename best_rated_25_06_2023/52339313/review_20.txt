I loved this so freaking much!!This story was so beautiful and had such a great cast of characters. I loved Yadriel, the main character, so much. He was such a strong character, that was struggling with so many things, such as being accepted by his family for being transgender. His best friend and cousin, Maritza, was another one of my favourites, as she was so sarcastic and witty. Finally, of course, I loved Julian Diaz so, so much! He was such a great character and I empathised with him a lot. The romance in here was also very cute and it felt very well developed and not rushed. The ending also shook me as I didnâ€™t see that coming! Overall, I just loved it so much and would highly recommend. I also did a vlog on my YouTube channel where I discussed my thoughts on this book, you can check that out here: https://youtu.be/KkjqEK5fdco
