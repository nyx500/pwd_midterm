Once in a while a book comes out of nowhere and blows me away; last year it was the indie sf Dancing with Eternity, this year it's Blood Song, a traditional fantasy in many ways but with a narrative pull that is just unbelievable - last time I read a fantasy debut with this pull, it was in 2007 when Name of the Wind appeared and while there are notable differences in content, with this one much more traditional than Rothfuss' series, there are a few similarities there too - while getting a lot of other things right from tone, to structure, to general world building that has both space and extendability so you do not feel the usual "sandbox, everything local is known" common to many secondary world fantasies today.I plan a full review for next week and I am rereading the book also as I want to stay in its universe more, while quite a few early details are better appreciated on a second or later reading.I will only note that while starting as an indie novel/series, Raven's Shadow has been bought by Penguin Books (Ace/Roc) and will be published in print too starting next year most likely with Blood Song, and the author is working hard at the sequel (Tower Lord) which may or may not see an indie publication or just be first published by Penguin.Blood Song ends at a good point and at the equivalent of ~600 pages offers a complete reading experience, so even if Tower Lord does not come out until say 2014 assuming the usual traditional publishing time frames, get it now and read it, whether you are a series completist or someone like myself who loves open series...
