"Maybe that was the trick to it: to survive, to dare to stay alive, to forge your own hope when all hope had run out."This all started in  Shadow and Bone, and seeing how far we have come, all that these characters have gone through to get here is just I honestly don't understand how people skip that series and think they can fully grasp the impact of what goes down in the SoC and N duologies ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Some non-spoilery thoughts for you:-How I went from hating Zoya to her being my favorite character in the series is just... Hats off Ms. Bardugo.-I thought I couldn't despise the Darkling more than I already did?? But then Zoya's POV, and Genya's reflections on their time at the Little Palace and the stuff that went down during TGT just doubled that. So there's that. Fuck the genocidal gaslighting asshat.-I will never hear the word 'Privateer' and not giggle.-The way this is relevant and relatable. The diversity. The impact. Wowww.
