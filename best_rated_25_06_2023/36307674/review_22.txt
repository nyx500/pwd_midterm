Ok this was much better than book 1, but I still stand by the fact that this really wasn’t a duology about Nikolai and that this duology really didn’t need to happen - there were a lot of choices that I disliked in this series overall. There were a lot of plot points thrown into this one story that I think could have used more time. But, the ending of this book wrapped things up rather nicely, and this book had a lot of scenes that reminded me why I love this world and Bardugo’s storytelling. I do hope we leave Ravka and these characters here, as I don’t think we need to revisit them anymore. Let them REST. I will have a full review and discussion on my channel this month.
