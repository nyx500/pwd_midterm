*shocked silence**clears throat awkwardly*So.This was great.It took me almost two months to read because school exists, but man it was a great time.This was my most anticipated release of the year, and my queen Leigh Bardugo thankfully did not disappoint me.I really have no idea how to write a coherent review of this because I just love everything.I feel like Leigh Bardugo's books are more centered around characters, rather than the plot. So like Six of Crows, Crooked Kingdom, and Kind of Scars, this book did revolve more around character development and relationships between characters than around the whole "war" thing.Despite that, the plot was also developed well, because of course we just got everything going on here. There was sort of a slow buildup to everything, and then shit really went down at the end.I don't even know what I'm saying, I'm just completely shocked and it doesn't help that the song I'm listening to right now is making me unable to think properly.AS FOR CHARACTERS.I love them.Zoya is a goddess.Nikolai is...well...Nikolai. Sarcastic, overconfident, absolutely perfect. Obviously.I have zero complaints about Nikolai and Zoya. I think their characters were developed well, as was the relationship between them. Nina and Mayu also had chapters in this.Nina's storyline was pretty interesting, but I found it kind of boring at times. I also feel the relationship between her and Hanne could have been developed better. But I love Nina anyways.And not gonna lie, I would reach Mayu's chapters and go count how many pages her chapter was because I didn't like those ones as much.So that was less than enjoyable.But I'm not going to take a star off for that because no.I'd just like to take a moment to appreciate how well Leigh Bardugo works diversity into her books.I just like how it doesn't feel like it's being shoved down my throat. It's just there and not seen as a big deal by anyone, which I think is great.Anyways.Overall, I loved this. I think I cried three times. I got my super plot twisty ending, which is just always what happens with these books. I love the characters.AAAAAAAAAAAAND I got the Kaz Brekker cameo that I wished for.The crows weren't around for very long (understandable, given that this is Nikolai's series), but in the couple chapters that they were present, I was literally screaming the whole time.So many quotable moments.Hilarious.Peak entertainment.Beautiful.--spoilers for the ending-- AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A SIX OF CROWS THREE. IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE END WAS A SET UP FOR A THIRD BOOK. ANOTHER HEIST. I NEED THIS SO MUCH I'M SO HAPPY. BUT I KEEP SEEING STUFF ABOUT HOW ONE OF THE CROWS WILL DIE AND THAT BETTER NOT HAPPEN.I LOVE THE CROWS SO MUCH THIS IS SERIOUSLY THE BEST NEWS OF THE MONTH, IT IS HAPPENING Is that all?Maybe.I really don't feel like proof reading this, so if there's a typo, I don't want to hear about it. Maybe I'll find it later.5/5 this Grishaverse is everything
