I originally read the Hobbit when I was 11 in my English lessons which was great as I had already been a fan of Lord of the Rings for a couple of years, so I was very excited to spot this in a charity shop!As I have been exposed to Peter Jackson's film creations for the formative years of my child/teenhood and spoilt by John Howe and Alan Lee's artwork, I did find the depictions of the characters a little difficult to get behind initially as I have a strong image in my mind already - but it was good to go back to the text and see how the artist had drawn their view of Middle Earth from Tolkien's story.As someone who on occasion dibble dabbles with paints and pencils (I'm not very good), I could really appreciate just how beautiful the artwork is and spent some time closely examining pages to see how elements were drawn.My only criticism of this graphic novel is that the whole book is extremely detailed and then it skims over the battle really quickly... I confess I will need to go back and read the battle of five armies part in the Hobbit to see if it is really that short - but my memories of the book have it as longer so near the end it felt a little as if it had run out of puff. But other than that, a great read.
