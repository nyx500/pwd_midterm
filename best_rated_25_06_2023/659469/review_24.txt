I really liked this book, I thought it was one of the better fictional books that I have read. I actually went and saw the movie not to long ago, it ran right alongside the story line. I would definitely recommend this book to the people that may have not of read it yet. This is a great book with some really interesting parts, I think it is a must read book.
