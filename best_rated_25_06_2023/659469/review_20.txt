The HobbitThere and back again...How could I resist returning to Middle Earth for an adventure? Especially since I've co-authored a fantasy/adventure set in New Zealand myself. Truth be told. I remember reading (well, sort of skimming) The Hobbit in my childhood and sadly I didn't appreciate J.R.R. Tolkien's flawless storytelling back then. But this time as I followed little Bilbo Baggins on his dangerous journey I was in awe of the author's rich and imaginative use of words. But I also couldn't help wondering how this sweet fairytale would've been received were it to have been written in 2013. Would today's reviewers criticize the character of Bard for popping up out of nowhere to play such an important part? No spoilers here, but it truly gave me pause as I read the "Fire and Water" chapter. It seemed kind of anticlimactic. Then again, maybe Tolkien's ability to use a humble hero like Bilbo in a way you might not expect is what makes The Hobbit so brilliant! So even if you've read it before, it's definitely worth going "there and back again!"
