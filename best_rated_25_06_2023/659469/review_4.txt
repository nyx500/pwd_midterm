Excellent adaptation, with beautiful art that captures Tolkien's fantasy world exceptionally. And how weird that Chuck Dixon wrote this?  This version of the Hobbit is quite dense for a graphic novel, with a lot of narration. There are some interesting choices in what to include, as goes for any adaptations of prose novels to other mediums, and I probably would have cut some more of the endless descriptions of travels and stretched out some more adventures. But it still overall works. The Hobbit is highly recommended for fans of all ages. Also, I am left wondering why there has never been a proper Lord of the Rings comic...
