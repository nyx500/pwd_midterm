This graphic novel sticks very close to Tolkien's text, even including much of the narration, which is nice, but means it's not really an adaptation, like I was sort of hoping. As it says on the cover, it's "an illustrated edition of the fantasy classic". It took me a little while to get used to the artwork, but I thought lots of it was very well done -- it fits the comic tone of The Hobbit a lot better than Alan Lee's epic artwork, even if I prefer Alan Lee as an artist.
