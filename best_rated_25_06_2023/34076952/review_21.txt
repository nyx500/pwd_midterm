Although I think some of the stories could have ended stronger, this is my favorite collection of novellas for any series ever. I read the original 3 stories when they were published online and LOVED them at that time and asked Leigh once if she'd ever published a collection of Grisha tales. I'm so happy this happened! They were even better the second time around, and the new stories were magical as well. You can see which classic fairy tales inspired some of these stories, but they all have their own twists and style. Although a few specific locations are mentioned, I don't think you need to have read any of the Grisha books to understand these stories. And the illustrations were gorgeous!
