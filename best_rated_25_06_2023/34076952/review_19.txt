“This is the problem with making a thing forbidden. It does nothing but build an ache in the heart.”4,5 out of 5 stars. This book wasn't high on my tbr pile, to be honest, most of all because I didn't want to spend the money on it and because I didn't expect my local libraries to hold a copy of it. So you can imagine the delight and the surprise when I discovered it just there, in the library.Normally, I'm not a huge fan of short story (or essay) collections. I know that my favourite author's story will be fantastic but I tend to forget most other novellas as soon as I've finished them; they're either unimpressive or not exactly my taste. This; however, was something else. The Language of Thorns was a unique collection of fairytales. Leigh Bardugo created wondrous stories and fierce characters. She is the queen of plottwists, that's for sure.I can't exactly pick a favourite. I loved all the tales but one: The Soldier Prince. It seemed to me that the author did not initially know where she was heading with the plot. The change of POV was irritating and overall the story seemed a bit messy, plot-wise as well as character-wise. It simply wasn't to my liking.Apart from that there's only one thing left to say: the illustrations are to die for. This book is so beautifully crafted. It's amazing (and on the other hand a little sad) to see how much effort will be put in a book when the publisher knows that the author is a goldmine. I wish smaller authors would experience this kind of support and effort once in a while.Find more of my books on Instagram
