“So shut the window tight and make sure the latch is fastened. Dark things have a way of slipping in through narrow spaces.”  Review per story: Ayama and the Thorn Wood - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️A unique spin on Cinderella and also on the monster in the labyrinth. The Too Clever Fox - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Really liked this one. Woodland creatures being attacked by a hunter. Koja the clever Fox decides to find out who it is and how they are targeting them. A good twist. The Witch of Duva - ⭐️⭐️⭐️This one was a bit grim even for me. Interesting take on the Gingerbread house in the woods, and on witches. The twist at the end made me feel a bit ill though. Little Knife - ⭐️⭐️⭐️A beautiful girl’s father is trying to marry her off to the best candidate. He sets 3 tasks to show their worth. A Grisha man is determined he will win her heart with the help of his friend the river. But the river has its own secrets. The Soldier Prince - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️A really good take on The Nutcracker. A clockmaker designs a nutcracker for a girl he wishes to woo, but unfortunately his greed comes back to bite him. The nutcracker discovers his own personality and wants. When Water Sang Fire - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Maybe my favourite. Ulla lives beneath the sea but she has always been treated differently. When she and her best friend Signy are invited to spend Summer on shore with the Prince they cannot wait. But what awaits them in the human world and what is the prince’s real aim? These were a vivid collection of stories that I enjoyed. I loved the illustrations and some of them were truly breathtaking. *************************So my original library copy went uncollected. I genuinely can’t remember why. But it’s available again now and I will not be missing out this time!!***********This one is finally available for me to pick up from the library! Can't wait to read these stories :)
