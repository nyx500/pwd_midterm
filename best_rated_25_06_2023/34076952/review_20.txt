WOW! Like seriously, I'm in awe of this!! I love ittt! These short stories were incredible and fascinating and enthralled me from beginning to end. Leigh Bardugo should truly think about writing books full of these short folklore and fairytale stories. I could read them all day especially the dark ones♥. I LOVE the more darker and creepy ones the most. I also find I love all the names Bardugo chooses to name her characters. They are always unique and fresh :) I recommend everyone read this regardless if they haven't read any of her other works. (❛‿❛) ꧁Individual ratings and reviews of each story below꧂ Ayama and the Thorn Wood ⭐⭐⭐⭐“This goes to show you that sometimes the unseen is not to be feared and that those meant to love us most are not always the ones who do.”This story was really heartbreaking and so beautiful at the same time. It was about a King and Queen who had two sons one is handsome and the other a beastly creature. The Beast Prince was cast aside and imprisoned. In this kingdom lived two sisters a beautiful one that loved to sing and everyone held in high esteem, the other was ugly and her name was Ayama. Her parents paid her no mind for she was nothing special. Everyone thought this Beast and Ayama was nothing but exposable, something to be used. Their paths kept crossing because Ayama was sent on these missions to the Thorn Woods to negotiate with this Beast. She tells him three different stories which I really loved! They were so so good. In the prosses bounding them together. They both go back to the castle and show everyone that appearances are not all that matters and should not be solely judged based on one's appearances. Some good advice for everyone to remember ;) The Too-Clever Fox ⭐⭐⭐⭐“I can bear ugliness,” he said. “I find the one thing I cannot live with is death.”This was a very enjoyable short story. It was dark and beautiful and it made me really sad 😭. This was all about having different perspectives :) It was about an ugly skinny fox name Koja who could talk his way out of every bad situation he found himself in. Whether it be being eaten as a kit to hounds to being eaten by a bear to a hunters trap, whatever the case he always had a trick up his sleeve (or rather paw lol), whatever it may be he could get them to do as he asks. He even became the bear, Ivan Gostov good friend. Koja had many friends in the forest despite his looks. I love his sarcasm! He was known to be the cleverest fox in all of Ravka. But for all his witty-ness and fast-talking, it doesn't mean he'll escape every trap set before him! Sometimes you need a trusted friend to save you. The Witch of Duva ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐“Dark things have a way of slipping in through narrow spaces.”Wow! The Witch of Duva was a pleasant surprise. I really loved this novella. It was so dark and really freaking creepy. CREEPY I tell you! That twist at the end seriously blindsided me like for reals I did not see that coming! It was shocking and I just really enjoyed this read. I wish it was much longer. This story was even a bit sick and twisted which I love. It was haunting and it gripped me right away. This one here is a must read! I absolutely love a good dark folklore tale. Little Knife ⭐⭐⭐⭐“She was terrifying in her beauty, bright like a devouring star.”This novella was wonderfully good :) It was very captivating and I was hooked! This was about an absolutely breathtakingly stunning girl named Yeva. She is the duke's daughter. He is desperately trying to find the perfect suitor and therefore he sets out all these different challenges. Yeva's beauty makes men lose their minds at the sight of her and all want to clam her as their own. The ending message was powerful and lovely♥. And that twist at the end I did not see coming! It was PERFECT. Honestly, this was so worth the read and I recommend Y'all taking the time to read it :)“Remember that to use a thing is not to own it.”The Soldier Prince ⭐⭐⭐“This is the problem with even lesser demons. They come to your doorstep in velvet coats and polished shoes. They tip their hats and smile and demonstrate good table manners. They never show you their tails.”This was not one of my favorite stories :( It wasn't bad though either! It just didn't resonate with me like the others have thus far. Idk, it was just lacking... something! This short story wasn't really dark in my opinion and after reading four stories that were 'The Soldier Prince' didn't hit the creepy factor. Still, I am happy I read it just the same :)  When Water Sang Fire ⭐⭐⭐⭐“This is the problem with making a thing forbidden. It does nothing but build an ache in the heart.”I found 'When Water Sang Fire' to be pretty damn enjoyable. Some parts dragged on at times and I wish this one would have been a bit shorter. But I loved Ulla!!! She was a fantastic character! I also really liked the plot. Another beautiful tale completed :)
