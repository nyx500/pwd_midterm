For our gunslinger, the journey is long. For his reader, even after eight books, the time feels short. Sorrow is tremendous, but the path is fulfilling. A beginning in the desert, three doorways from another world, five makes a ka-tet, and Browning poem. Ka is a wheel, but all things must have an ending. As the door closes gently behind, another opens before him. And so I would and will walk this road again with Roland again.Five stars for this final book. Five stars for the series.
