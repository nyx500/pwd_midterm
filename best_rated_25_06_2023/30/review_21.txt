5* Given to this as a dramatisation onlyI throughly enjoyed listening to it, ignoring the book. However, I would feel unfair if I didn't point out the differences from the book as given at Tolkein GatewayThe script by Brian Sibley and Michael Bakewell attempts to be as faithful as possible to the original novels, but there are some errors and alterations. They include: • At one point, Minas Anor and Minas Tirith are referred to as though they were separate cities; these are merely alternate names for the same city. • Part of the Battle of Pelennor Fields sequence is described in song by an opera-style vocalist rather than acted, which may distance some listeners from the action. Others may find the kinship between the sequence and Eddic style of storytelling interesting. • The journey through Drúadan Forest and the subsequent alliance with Ghân-buri-Ghân's wild men, or "woses" is removed from the radio drama. • Quickbeam the Ent does not appear in the story. • Gildor Inglorion does not appear in the story. • The radio serial omits the sequence in the book in which the hobbits visit with Tom Bombadil. However, in doing so, the Hobbits are never shown to receive their swords from the Barrow-downs and so it remained a mystery how the Witch-king was able to be so wounded
