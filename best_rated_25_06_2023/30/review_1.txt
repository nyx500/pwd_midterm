As this is my fourth or fifth read through of this book, I feel like I don't need to repeat myself and construct a long-winded review on how this is quite easily, my favourite set of books. Instead, I'm going to write a few words on how I feel right at this moment. Coming to the end of LOTR feels like coming home to a comfortable chair, a warm mug of fine coffee, and a large slab of carrot cake with extra cream cheese frosting. It's rather like an old friend, and I'm positive it is one I will revisit, again and again throughout my life. This particular time, I felt a deeper connection to the story and the characters, and I was totally immersed in every single chapter. It was difficult to tear myself away, even for a moment. Gandalf and Ã‰owyn will always have that special space in my heart. Her character often reminds me of myself, in many ways. (I also would have totally delivered that killing blow to The witch king). Probably one of my favourite excerpts, that has stood the test of time;"Arise, arise, riders of Rohan!Fell deeds awake, fire and slaughter!Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered!A sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!Ride now, ride now, ride to Gondor!"In the final chapter or so, I'm not ashamed to admit that I found it difficult to hold back those bittersweet tears. What a wonderful world Mr John Ronald Reuel Tolkien created for us all to love and enjoy! I am so grateful that my wonderful Dad introduced me to Middle Earth at such a young age. Thank you Dad, you did well.
