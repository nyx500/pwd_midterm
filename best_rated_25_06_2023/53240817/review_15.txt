2023 re-read: It's still greatThis was just as good as people said it would be. Amari and the Night Brothers is a fantastic start to a new middle grade fantasy series that centers a young Black girl and weaves together mythology and folktales ranging from vampires to Bigfoot in one very real supernatural world. It's a book about friendship, family, standing up for what's right, dealing with prejucide and bullying, privilege, and finding your inner strength. Amari has been dealing with bullying in school, comes from a poor neighborhood that people stereotype as "bad", and doesn't know what has happened to her beloved older brother since his disappearance. But when she discovers a secret briefcase he left for her, she's introduced to a magical world she never knew existed. So begins a rich, fun, magical story that still feels very grounded in real issues young people face, especially children and teens of color. And I feel like maybe I should have, but I didn't see the twist at the end coming! Though looking back I can see the signs. Really loved this and look forward to reading more in the series.
