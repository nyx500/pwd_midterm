“Don't you long for something different to happen, something so exciting and new it carries you along with it like a great tide, something that lets your life blaze and burn so the whole world can see it?”Where do I start?How can I put into words the magnitude of Juliet Marillier's writing?How can I explain to someone who hasn't lived through her books that Son of the Shadows left me a sobbing mess,that there were scenes so emotionally brutal and devastating that it felt like my heart was ripped from my chest and squeezed until there was no blood left?And that despite the pain and the agony,I felt pure in the end?“Come, dear heart.Lean on me and let us walk this path together.”Together.The Sevenwaters family,Red and Sorcha's family believed that there would be no evil in the world they could not face together.And that is precisely the reason the evil forces tried to divide them,to wreak havoc and mistrust on a family that valued their bond more than anything else.Secrets and betrayals came to light,one by one,threading a web of isolation and anger.Liadan,Sorcha's dutiful daughter,the healer with the Sight,was caught in the middle of it.For it was her the Fair Folk had been waiting for generations to help fulfill an ancient prophecy.But Liadan was no mere tool.Nor was Bran,despite everyone's efforts to convince her otherwise.Warriors,druids,mercenaries,misguided girls,they were all woven in a pattern and Liadan held the key to either destruction or salvation.“Your actions are your own.Your choices are your own.Each of us carries a burden of guilt for decisions made or not made.You can let that rule your whole life or you can put it behind you and move on.”This was not a happy story.Sorcha's courage and sacrifice held her family together,but they were not enough.Liadan on the other hand wasn't as willing as her mother to follow the path the Fair Folk chose for her.She was a strong and independent woman,she made her choices against everyone's warnings.But she loved fiercely,like her parents did.And while Bran wasn't Prince Charming,just a scary and equally scared man consumed by hatred and bloodlust,he was perfect for her,and she for him.“He and I…we share a bond. Not love, exactly. It goes beyond that. He is mine as surely as sun follows moon across the sky. Mine before ever I knew he existed. Mine until death and beyond.” I try to swallow my grief for everything that happened,but my feelings are overwhelming and difficult to control.My heart breaks for the trials my heroes had to face,but I keep admiring them for their strength.Conor made some huge mistakes,and so did Red,and Liam,and Sean,and Niahm but I cannot blame them,not when they thought they did the right thing for the people they loved.“The world is simple in its essence. Life,death,love,hate.Desire,fulfillment.Magic.” All of these elements combined make this story a unique one,like the tales your grandfather used to tell you by the hearth.Irish mythology entangled with high fantasy,the ancient battle between Good and Evil and the mortals in between made an extraordinary book,one of those that stay with you forever.
