This is my favorite book of all time. My copy is dog-eared, and I'm looking around for another one. This was the book that set me off on my love for Juliet Marillier's books. The simple elegance of the prose was the perfect voice for Liadan, the main character. The love between Bran and Liadan spoke to me the first time I read it and has echoed deeper and deeper with every reading (of which there are many). In my opinion, this is better than the other two because the characters all have a way of worming themselves into your heart.
