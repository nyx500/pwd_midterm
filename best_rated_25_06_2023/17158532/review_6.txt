It's official....Laurent and Damen are up there as one of my favourite M/M couples.This series was everything I hoped it would be and this book is definitely the best in the series.....First thing,a MASSIVE thank you to Em for lending me this series.The price definitely put me off.I really can't explain how much I loved this story.So,with 3 books in the series it's the ultimate slow burn.Enemies to lovers that's so compelling and captivating.The scene setting was beautiful,the characters(while not always likable) were so well developed and fascinating.I'm not even going to attempt to explain the story here...let's face it,if you've read the first two books you'll be desperate to read this one.Damen and Laurent completely stole my heart.This will be a series I read over and over....Just amazing!!BR with Andrea.Thanks,darling for going through the finale of this beautiful story with me.
