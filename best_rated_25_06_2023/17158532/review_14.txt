Oh. My. God.  ✅ Hate-to-love✅ Characters✅ Sexual tension and smut (MM)✅ Romance✅ Political scheming✅ Pace✅ Plot✅ Action and war ❗️❗️ This series is highly addictive❗️❗️ Trigger warnings : slavery, murders, and mentions of incest and pedophilia. I decided to give this series a try and to read the first book because it was intriguing, and here I am, 36 hours later, having just finished the third book of this series and wondering why I didn't read it sooner. Kings Rising is a book full of deceptions, fights, and unexpected turns. The plot is so compelling and so full of twists, some of them I saw coming, but some of them took me completely by surprise. I read it all in one sitting, and there was no way I would have been able to stop reading before I knew how Damen and Laurent's adventure would end. The political intrigue in this book is intense, and Laurent's scheming still took me by surprise even after reading about his cleverness in the two previous books.The pace of this series is intense, yet among all the fights and betrayal, there are sweet and quiet moments that had me smiling like an idiot, and that gave more depth to the story and the characters."I hated you," said Laurent. "I hated you so badly I thought I’d choke on it. If my uncle hadn’t stopped me, I would have killed you. And then you saved my life, and every time I needed you, you were there, and I hated you for that, too."This series is also my first time reading an M/M romance, and I am speechless. The author managed to build a slow-burn romance (one of the best I've ever read), that really reflected how both characters were torn between their feelings and the fact that they should hate the other. I loved how we got to see the complexity of their feelings, even though Damen is a strong fighter and Laurent is used to hide his feelings to protect himself.   "I think if I gave you my heart, you would treat it tenderly."I LOVE THIS SERIES. Truly. Deeply. The first book might be more controversial because of the pleasure slave business, but the rest of the series is really more focused on politics, fighting, and a complex enemies-to-lovers relationship. It is an amazing series that I strongly recommend to anyone looking for a great slow-burn enemies-to-lovers relationship and an incredible and unpredictable political plot-line.Captive Prince ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5Prince's Gambit ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Artwork by Merwild (it's so gorgeous I want to cry!) 😍😍Follow me on Instagram 🙂
