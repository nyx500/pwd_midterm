I didn't want this Trilogy to end :((You really need to read the entire trilogy and I did read them in order, all at one time.I feel as though I have lost friends and as though I have learned some true lessons, just by reading and becoming lost in these books. If you are a true fantasy lover, I sincerely believe that you will enjoy these immensely.The characters, the worlds, the plot...all are terrific! However, the feelings that are evoked during the story and the consequences of actions taken will stay with me long after I've moved on to other stories. One of the best things about this book was that the characters really stuck to what they believed. The thing I'll remember about BEYOND THE SHADOWS a year from now is the theme of consequences for one's actions. Every major character of the story has to deal with their personal consequences on one level or another. Weeks does a great job of wrapping up the story that he's presented here in the Night Angel Trilogy, and it's easy to see why this series has received the acclaim that it has. Weeks has been signed to another three book deal from Orbit, and it's going to be exciting to see what he does next.
