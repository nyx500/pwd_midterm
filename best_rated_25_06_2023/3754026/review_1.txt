Oh my god this book was terrible.The first book in the trilogy, I liked. Started off a bit dark, cracked along at a pace, lots of twists and turns and all in all a good read if slightly melodramatic with some truly terrible prose. Also I liked the idea of this "Night Angel" superhero and I loved Durzo's character.Second book: began a bit like a teenage boys wet dream. Quite annoying really and quite strange to read as an adult. I found all the descriptions about how Elene wouldn't sleep with him really uncomfortable. However, Vi intrigued me and then Durzo reappeared. So I thought I'd give the third book a go.The third book was awful, moralising, live as a good christian crap. "Good" people wait until they're married for sex while "evil" people sleep around and then get some kind of punishment for it. What happened to Uly? Durzo truned into a hand-clasping, worst kind of american sitcom "gee-i'm-proud-of-you" dad nightmare from being a hard nut with no feelings. Vi developed the character of a wet dishcloth (but that's OK cos she got Kylar in the end) Kylar maintained the emotional depth of a 12 year old. And then at the very end Elene saved the world with "love" and dying to redeem humanity.Bleeeeuuuuuuggghgh.Cannot remember being so angry at the end of books for a long time. Complete waste of my time and money...shame on you Mr Weeks.
