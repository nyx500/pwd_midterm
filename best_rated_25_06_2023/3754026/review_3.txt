So, I started the 3rd volume in the Night Angel trilogy to read something easy between the Booker longlisters. I read for a bit, I listened for a bit, when I realized that I do not give a s*** anymore about the characters or the plot. Sorry Weeks but you lost me at the 2nd volume. Oh well, there are plenty other epic series to read, some which are hopefully better.
