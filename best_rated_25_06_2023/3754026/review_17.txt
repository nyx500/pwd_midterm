2.5 stars. (Edited this after a year because the more I thought about it, that ending was utter #@$%. It deserves 2.5 since the book was half bad. I haven't been able to read anything by Brent Weeks since, and I don't think I'll ever touch his works again. This book is decent in many parts, but offers an ending that is not as satisfactory as I had expected from the Night Angel trilogy. Beyond the Shadows had many great scenes, Kylar's battle with Lantano Garuwashi, and his and Logan's later friendship with the saceurai, Kylar's attempts to finish off Terah Graesin once and for all, and the final scene where everyone combined their magic to stop the horde of kruls from overwhelming the world.It offers a conclusion to everyone's story, with some having quite a happy ending, whereas others are sad. In the end, Midcyru would continued to be protected and saved by the Night Angel again and again, forevermore into the days of the future. This entire trilogy had been an epic roller coaster ride of splendid action scenes, intricate & realistic characterization, and masterful storytelling for me, and I would surely sorely missed it, and the story of Kylar Stern, long after this.
