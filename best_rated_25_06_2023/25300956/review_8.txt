I’ve done it. I read 100 books this year. And what a book it happened to be the one that helped my finish the challenge. Royal Assassin is the 2nd volume in the Farseer Trilogy and one of the few middle books in a series that does not suffer from the filler syndrome. As per the previous installment, I have to mention that not everyone will enjoy reading Hobb. Royal Assassin is a beautifully written, very slow, characters driven story. There aren’t many battle scenes, not much humor, on the contrary, there are so many bad things happening to the main characters that some might even found reading it depressing. It is all worth it though. As I said, Hobb can write so beautifully and the characters are complex and different. You get to befriend some and really dislike others. We spend a lot of time inside Fitz’s mind with his love for Molly and his hurts for many, many reasons. Yes, it can get repetitive at times but I realized I did not mind. The bonding between Nighteyes and Fitz is amazing; I could not wait to read more scenes between those two. The last 150 pages a way more alert and the ending has a cliffhanger of sorts. The novel is narrated by Paul Boehmer and I thought he did a wonderful job to bring life to the characters. I cannot wait to listen to him narrating the last part.
