Proposed alternate title: FitzChivalry Farseer and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good Very Bad Day (Year, Life, etc.)On one hand, this feels like a three-star read: for an epic fantasy book (and series), not much happens, (certainly not much that feels very epic), there’s a paucity of truly intriguing villains (and no monsters), and the magic system is not particularly well defined. Plus, as suggested by the proposed alternate title above…man, poor Fitz just gets constantly pummeled in the giggleberries by life. And then it gives him a wedgie. And points and laughs. And then shoves a brontosaurus up his backside without even doing him the courtesy of lubing it up. (Side note: how much KY would be required to fully coat a brontosaurus? I bet no one has ever bothered to figure that out. Inexplicably, I might add.)On the other hand…There’s something extremely compelling, almost addictive, about the prose. Hobbs is a master stylist with a voice that’s perfect for the genre, and her affinity for detail not only makes the world feel realistic (in the sense of not doing anything unfair to the reader), but every time she describes food, my mouth starts watering (thank goodness Kindles are easier to clean than paperbacks). She’s also created a set of characters who, for the most part, are complex and interesting and don’t hew to typical fantasy stereotypes. So, we’ll give it an extra star for that. In all, an engaging series, and one I’m looking forward to continuing. I just hope the epicness ramps up a bit in the concluding volume…
