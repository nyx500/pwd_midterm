Royal Assassin(Farseer Trilogy,#2 Realm of the Elderlings,#2)This book makes it incredibly easy to emotionally drain oneself. As the second book of this series, this book has surpassed my expectations. Engaging characters. Interesting setting. Robin Hobb has a wondrous way to express complex emotions and internal struggles. As a fan of the slow-paced fantasy novel, I am certainly not disappointed.The man who must brag for himself knows that no one else will.Excellent Book
