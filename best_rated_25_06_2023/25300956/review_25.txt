“The fight isn't over until you win it, Fitz. That's all you have to remember. No matter what the other man says.”I continued to immerse myself in the world of the Six Duchies in Robin Hobb's Royal Assassin (Farseer Trilogy, #2). Fitz begins as a shell of his former self. As he is nursed back to (humanity), we see lots of his interaction with his wolf, Nighteyes (a big favorite), Chade, Prince Verity, Lady Patience and Kettricken. And then there is Prince Regal, who somehow remains unchecked. While I very much enjoyed this book, I was a little frustrated by bad choices that were made by a number of characters, and then not really questioned. Or it was somehow suggested that these bad choices were part of a plan within a plan that couldn't be revealed to Fitz. Despite any reservations I might have, I very much want to see where this goes. Also, I love the writing and the immersive storytelling, and so raced to the third book.
