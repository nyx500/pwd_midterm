Check out my YouTube channel where I show my instant reactions to reading fantasy books as soon as I finish the book.Absolutely perfect character development that would be impossible to surpass, and an amazing book on it's own right.Robb Hobb is quickly turning into one of my favorite authors, and it's strange for me because the things she does well are things that I typically don't appreciate much in fantasy books. More than anything, I'm someone who really wants a huge engaging plot - and I don't care as much if character development isn't top notch. But this book figures out a way somehow to make literally every single character feel completely developed, with clear and compelling motivations, and makes you completely understand and sympathize with their motivations and behaviors - and that's true even for the characters that you hate. It ends up making the reader feel deeply attached to certain characters in a way that few (if any) books have done before.Don't get me wrong, the plot is also extremely well done, but if the character writing were sub-par, this book wouldn't be a 5 star rating from me. But the way this book is written makes it intense and compelling, and I absolutely flew through reading it.
