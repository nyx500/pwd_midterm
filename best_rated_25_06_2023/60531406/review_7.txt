Tress of the Emerald Sea is a whimsical, earnest, and surprisingly crustacean-free surprise novel from Sanderson’s record-breaking Kickstarter. It is also one of the best YA fantasy books I’ve read. Every aspect of the book feels balanced and rewarding. Tress is perfectly paced and compulsively readable, full of plot twists that make sense but are still thrilling. I wasn’t sure if Hoid’s narration would be effective, but it definitely is. His commentary strikes the perfect balance between silliness and genuine insight. The familiar adventure structure of the story runs the risk of becoming predictable, but Sanderson doesn’t fall in that trap here. His skill as a storyteller shines in this novel; it is further proof that he doesn’t need thousands of pages to tell a compelling, meaningful story that is also fun and wholesome and heartfelt. I can already tell that this will be a book I look back on with fondness and warm, nostalgic feelings. Tress of the Emerald Sea is one of those gently affecting books that make the world seem a bit less scary.5 stars“It’s really not a problem that someone needs to be saved. Everyone needs help. It’s hard to be the person who makes trouble, but the thing is, everyone makes trouble. How would we help anyone if nobody ever needed help?”
