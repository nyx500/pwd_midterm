3.5 stars! I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand I really liked the premise of the book, but on the other hand the pacing was inconsistent and the plot dragged at times. The pacing was slow for most of the book until the end. The world building was great, the idea of an ocean of spores was very interesting, although it was confusing at first. I really liked Tress, she is brave, kind, loyal, persistent, and strong. At first I had a hard time connecting with Tress, but once I got to know her, I really liked her and felt a connection to her. I also really liked Huck, (talking rat) he is sweet, funny, brave, and intelligent. I liked the side characters as well, but I wished that their back stories were explored a bit more. The narration was unique and interesting, but it was hard to get used to at first. It has first person narration but the narrator is not the main character. The ending was so good and exciting! I’m glad that it ended on a happy note. Overall, it was a decent book, but it didn’t wow me and I struggled with the slow pacing.
