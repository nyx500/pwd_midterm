So what do you know, experimental Sanderson is absolutely awesome!His typical mastery of storytelling, worldbuilding and character work were present, of course. The whimsical tone of the story that still manages to pack some serious and not-so-serious philosophical messages was the icing on the cake. Fun, delightful and chock-full of Cosmere in an incredibly imaginative world that borders more on sci-fi than fantasy, Tress of the Emerald Sea is a very promising start to The Year of Sanderson.P/S: The production value of this book was spectacular and I don't even have the physical copy yet, which I'm certain will be stunning to behold.
