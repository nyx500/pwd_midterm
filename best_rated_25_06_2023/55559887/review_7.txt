For 95% of this book I was so done with this series, because I couldn't take any more of the inner monologues or the extensive description of every little thing around the heroine, but then the last 5% came and you know what? It was such a serve and that cliffhanger? THAT FREAKING CLIFFHANGER? The only reason why I'm going to pick up the last book next year. I hate it here. Well played, Noami Novik, well played 👏🏽┍━━━━━━━━━━━━━┑ THE SCHOLOMANCE SERIES #1 A Deadly Education – 3 stars#2 The Last Graduate – 2.25 stars (the extra 0.25 is for that cliffhanger)#3 The Golden Enclaves – tbr┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━┙
