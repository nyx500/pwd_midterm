I don't know how to feel? Believe me, no one is more disappointed than I am about this rating. Considering I gave the first one five stars this makes me so sad. I absolutely love this concept, this world, and these characters but this second book was a slog. Part of the reason the first one worked is because we were all discovering The Scholomance together and learning our about characters AND they were working toward a mutual goal together. What made this second installment not work is that it was the exact same thing. It was hundreds more pages of them working towards getting through their graduation and fighting the Mals in the basement (which spoiler alert was basically what they did in the first book). I just felt like we were constantly just doing different tasks that were going to help in the last scene of the book and I was just bored. What works for a first book, doesn't work for a second. We needed expansion, a different conflict, and more plot movement and that's not what we got. The last 50 pages of this book saved it. We finally saw some progress in El and Orian's relationship and the cliffhanger at the end does make me somewhat interested in the last book but I definitely feel like the plot wavered in this one. Nothing makes me more sad than writing a bad review for an anticipated sequel.
