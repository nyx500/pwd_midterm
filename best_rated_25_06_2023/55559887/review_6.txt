Something feels so intensely nostalgic about this series. It’s a significantly darker interpretation of the magic school trope, which might be a contributor. But I think it’s the series’ ability to deliver the satisfaction and exhilaration that I’ve been craving, a feeling that I associate with novels I read when I was younger and got addicted to every book I read.The Last Graduate finds a perfect balance between dark cynicism and a new feeling of hope and warmth that is surprising but not out of place. El is a wonderfully sardonic main character with an internal monologue that never gets old. Her anger and fiery wit, along with the nonstop action and satisfyingly effortless writing, made me speed through this book. The magic system is so contained; it’s gratifying to read something that’s creative without making me stretch my imagination to visualize. This is becoming one of my favorite fantasy series. 5 stars
