Well, I can pretty confidently say that if you loved Deadly Education, you're probably going to enjoy The Last Graduate just as much!We once again join El as she battles against the monsters of the Scholomance while trying to construct a plan to Graduate the school alive, with the help of Orion and the rest of her allies.Once again, I related to El deeply throughout this book and I truly adore her as a character. I love that the heroine of this series is a defensive, angry teenage girl battling against an affinity to dark magic and the things in her past that have caused her to close herself off. I once again, also adored Orion - especially as he is the antithesis of El with his big sunshine himbo energy.Sadly though, this book once again hit at a middle of the road 3 stars for me, because while I love the characters, setting and plot of this series, even tearing up slightly towards the end, I can't get past how much I dislike the writing style of these books.While a conversational writing style is not my favourite, it's something I can generally get on board with. However the combination of that and the endless cutaway exposition really ruins this series for me.So essentially, 5 stars for character, setting and plot - 1 star for writingBut I am pretty confident that no matter your opinions on book 1 in this series, you'll pretty much feel the same about book 2 so if you loved Deadly Education, you're in for a treat!
