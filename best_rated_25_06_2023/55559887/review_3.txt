Hogwarts meets Deadly Class with Anakin Skywalker’s transition to Darth Vader vibes : this action packed, dark, extremely sarcastic, entertaining second book of the series absolutely hooks you from the first chapter and you wish not to finish in one sit: you hit your head so hard against the wall and keep cursing why you didn’t you go slower, savoring each chapter and enjoy every reading moment! Especially that ending! That freaking ending! I literally howled like a crying wolf!  The impressive world building, action packed, heart pounding adventures, sarcastic , balanced pace, extremely witty tone of El and her evolving characterization by learning how to control her power and her complicated love story with Orion ( yes, her mother wrote a letter to her to warm El about Orion: but could she stay away from him by listening her mother advise: hell no! ) make your fingers glued to this reading. I can say this new adventure is more about with will happen to our characters when they eventually graduate after their survival at the final year of Scholomance! What kind of future awaiting for them? Could El and Orion share a dreamy path at the outside world even though it seems more threatening they’ve been through recent years.  I’m not gonna give away more! You gotta read this book and after reaching to jaw dropping, truly heart wrenching, WTH ending, I advise you to scream at the top of your lungs. And start raising your hands to the air, praying for early release of third book! I’m giving five magical, clever, mind blowing, wizard world, mana-full, happy graduation stars! Special thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group/ Ballantine/ Del Rey for sharing the most anticipated book’s arc copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts.
