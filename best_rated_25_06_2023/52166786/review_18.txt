Well, I am glad that it ended. Though not as majestic I was expecting this finale to be after how the second book ended. While I loved Ali, Nahiri, and Dara's story arc but it was Jamshid who stole the show here for me. There were times where I thought he would take a step back when it was time to pick sides but he surprised me at every turn. My biggest disappoint here was the villain. Her character deteriorated with each passing chapter and lost all its shine by the time we reached the final scene. She forgot what she was fighting for and wend mad for power. Had she stuck to her initial aim and not went on to become a lunatic, I think I would have liked this book much better.
