✰ 5 stars ✰“Happy endings can be caught, but they are difficult to hold on to. They are dreams that want to escape the night. They are treasure with wings. They are wild, feral, reckless things that need to be constantly chased, or they will certainly run away.”I take back every negative thought I had about Stephanie Garber's writing style, because The Ballad of Never After was SO GOOD! The character dynamics - the plot twist - the repressed sexual tension - the pacing - the dialogue - the yearning - everything was *chef's kiss*! I cannot believe how much better it was than the first part! Kicking off, literally right where we left off, Eva and Jacks are on their way, to find four magical stones that when brought together will aid in unlocking the Vallory Arch and reveal the Fate mysteries that lie behind the hidden door.This was an incredibly enjoyable read, I am in awe at how fluid the pacing was, how much I was engaged with the intrigues and ploys, how much the limited cast of characters entertained me, how much the writing read like a fairy tale. It was a magical read - so caught up in the danger, the allures, the mystery, the banter! 😅 Everything panned out so beautifully and so well - never was there a second where I was bored. “Do you kiss the prince because you actually enjoy it?” Jacks asked. “Or is it because you honestly think it will magically revive him?”“Maybe I do it because I know it will annoy you,” Evangeline answered archly.Jacks flashed a smile that was far more wicked than welcoming. “Glad to know you’re thinking about me when you kiss your husband.”Heat flushed her cheeks. “I’m not thinking nice things.”“Even better.”Eva is such a fun and pure heroine - she really grew on me this time around. Her kind-hearted nature is so admirable and her continuous denial of her attraction and affection for Jacks is so genuine and hot! Uff, the continuous dance they played around each other, the levels of suppressed intimacy had me wanting to shake them! They care about each other so much, but too stubborn and afraid to admit it! That one particular scene had me just!! 😳😳😳 It was heightened so beautifully with the desperation of wanting from both sides - ah, the pining!!“He held her like a secret, pulling her close to his pounding heart.”♥️♥️♥️“Do you still think of me as just a tool?”Jacks frowned. “I try not to think of you at all.”JACKS! Jacks, prince of hearts, you have stolen my heart! 💕💕💕 Eva and Jacks, Jacks and Eva! Their chemistry, the sexual tension, the latent visceral desire, their witty charming banter! He's a 'monster', a flirtatious tease, but still has that caring, protective side that he lets out , which has me swooning. I am in awe at how much I've fallen for him! 😍😍 Ah, I've just found out that he actually appears first in her other trilogy, which I must make a point to check out asap! I love that we got more background into his history - how much pain, he's been feeling all this long and unable to express it. And not only Jacks, but the other colorful cast of characters; limited as they are, each of them became more fleshed out, with more personalities and feelings to relate to. And with that web of fate that somehow connects them all sharing the one goal and Eva being the key to it all. ✨✨“It didn’t do anything to me,” chimed Jacks.“Only because the luck stone makes people reckless, and you’re always reckless,” Chaos replied.Jacks shrugged. “What’s the point of being an immortal if you live like a human?”🥰🥰🥰And that cliffhanger! The plot twist! It's not so much so the actual cliffhanger, per se, but the way it was presented, the steady build up of tension and suspense, how Ms.Garber orchestrated the writing to play on our emotions and then just leave us hanging there! 🥺🥺 It was heart-breaking and brilliant - I felt as if I was going through the five stages of grief! 😅 And maybe, it's a bit of an obvious twist, but it was how she executed it that had me reeling! 💜From thisto 😭 😭Suffice to say, I am most eagerly awaiting it's sequel this fall. 😄 It has bewitched me completely, and I want to see this once upon these broken hearts get their happily ever after that they so readily deserve.“I wish our story could have had another ending.”🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
