"I'm here, and I'm never going to let you go."THIS ISNT FUNNY, THIS ISNT THE END THIS LITERALLY CANNOT BE THE END. theres another book i refuse to believe there isnt another one otherwise stephanie garber is officially the #1 most cruelest author of all the authors ive read fromi was this ü§è close to crying, im going to pretend the last 40ish pages do not exist. that was pure agony im not okay.but other than that devastation (!!) another favourite this was perfection. i love this even more than ouabh. tbona had everything i was so excited for before.ALL THE YEARNING BTWN JACKS AND EVANGELINE SDKHGKS IT WAS TORTURE READING i love themü•π and just the so many reveals its amazing especially that last one at the end ??? CHAOS BEING CASTOR VALOR THE PRINCE AKA THE HANDSOME STRANGER IN THOSE DREAMS ??? I NEVER WOULDVE EXPECTED THAT. i suspected jacks would be the archer but then midway i was doubting myself BUT I WAS RIGHT IN THE END poor jacks killed his first loveüò≠ the world was explored so much more (the hollows is officially my favourite place!!) and the finding about the pasts of the valors and jacks omg. and even just getting more screen time of some side characters in the last book !! (major spoilers ‚Üí i adored apollo's character and felt bad for him UP UNTIL A POINT MY GOD I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT ENDING HE STOLE ALL OF EVANGELINE'S MEMORIES AND THEN HAD THAT FAKE SMILE ON üòÉ like i know the price for jacks turning back time to save evangeline was her losing her memories of him (which i still cannot get over i was about to cry) but the fact that he was smiling and acting like everything was alright??? confusion 101. ALSO NOT CHAOS KILLING EVANGELINEü§°ü§° it was an accident but stillüò≠) thank god marisol was barely in here.i literally cannot get enough of jacks and evangeline. their moments <33 the bantering, the soft moments, AND SO MANY TROPES I NEVER KNEW I NEEDED BTWN THEM THAT I GOT SKHGSK LITERALLY WAS SCREAMING. and for a situation where jacks cant kiss anyone bc theyll die, the romance wasüìàüìài just need to share my favourite moments btwn them so dont click on this if you dont want to get spoiled:"Do you kiss the prince because you actually enjoy it?" Jacks asked. "Or is it because you honestly think it will magically revive him?""Maybe I do it because I know it will annoy you," Evangeline answered archly.Jacks flashed a smile that was far more wicked than welcoming. "Glad to know you're thinking about me when you kiss your husband."I DIED HERE THE COMEBACK WAS SO SMOOTH HELPand the moment where the "gentle hands instead of harsh ones wrapped protectively around her" and jacks getting angry for evangelineü•∫ literally the LOVE there. i love how evangeline felt safe and content in jacks arms always my god i cant with these two. "Everything was fuzzy and distant, but she knew, somehow, that these arms held her closer than the hot arms ever had."THERE WERE EVEN TWO SCENES WHERE EVANGELINE IS HURT AND JACKS IS THERE RIGHT AWAY TO SAVE HER. and one of those scene was golden, jacks himself nursed her back to healthü•π the softness in jack was so sweet and everything help. literally this was so adorable, seeing this side of jacks:‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so good at this‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúDo you often travel with girls who‚Äôve been flayed?‚Äù This earned her a soft laugh. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Then quietly, as he ran a cloth along her lower back, just below the dip in her waist, ‚Äúwould you be jealous if I did?‚ÄùI‚Äôm not a jealous person was what Evangeline intended to say, but instead the words ‚ÄúOf course‚Äù came out. Jacks laughed, louder this time.Embarrassement surged through her. "That's not what I meant to say." "It's all right. I'd probably kill another man if I found him with you like this"SDKJFGKSHS I LOVE THEM STOPoh oh and then also jacks jumping off a cliff with evangeline and dragging her out of the ocean stubbornly saying "I will not let you die", this boy is so obviously in love. he's so protective of her, the way he panics seeing evangeline hurt"I know, love. I'm going to take you somewhere safe."HE CALLED HER "LOVE" JACKS CALLED EVANGELINE LOVE I WAS SCREAMING AND STILL AM SDJGHKSHG[Evangeline] "Do you still think of me as just a tool?" Jacks frowned. "I try not to think of you at all."i-ü•πü•πü•π but of all of these THIS WAS OFC MY FAVOURITE"It's just one night. In the morning you can forget it. You can go back to pretending you don't like me, and I can pretend I don't care. But for tonight, let me pretend you're mine"THE WAY I SCREAMED. TAKE ME BACK TO THIS MOMENT. TAKE ME BACK. im going to cry jacks admitting all this."He held her so tightly it hurt, but this pain she didn‚Äôt mind. She‚Äôd let him crush her, let him break her, just as long as he never let her go. This was what she wanted, and she refused to believe that he didn‚Äôt want it, too."seeing this after the end hurts more than i ever couldve imagined i really will never be okay what happened to the happy moments ???no because i literally have 5 pages of notes on a word doc, i could go on forever but im going to stop before i start crying again. and i just need to share some of my other favourite quotes these were so beautiful:"The secret to staying in love is having someone who will catch you when you start to fall out of it. And I promise to always catch you.""Happy endings can be caught, but they are difficult to hold on to. They are dreams that want to escape the night. They are treasure with wings.. They are wild, feral, reckless things that need to be constantly chased, or they will certainly run away.""She used to think love was like a house. Once it was built, a person got to live in it forever. But now she wondered if love was more like a war with new foes constantly appearing and battles creeping up. Winning at love was less about succeeding in a battle and more about continuing a fight, to choose the person you loved as the one you were willing to die for, over and over."AND THEN THESE TWO HAD TO GO AND DESTROY MEüòÉThat is not a small mistake to fix. If you do this, Time will take something equally valuable from you.""There is nothing of equal value to me."HAHAHA STOP IM GOING TO CRY HE SAID IT HIMSELF. THERE IS NOTHING OF EQUAL VALUE TO HIM"She was crying so hard she could barely see. But she knew that she was alone. Not just alone in this strange place but alone in the world. She felt it down to her bones."and now im done. a empty shell of my former self stephanie really had to land that last blow after everything elsei stand by what i said before this CANNOT be the end, literally impossible, especially the fact that not once did miss stephanie say when advertising her book that this was the "thrilling conclusion to the series" so we're all good everyone !! im sorry, this review was such a chaotic mess.also that chapter from jacks pov is not enough i need a whole book please and thank youjust how can such a beautiful cover have such an evil ending wow_____pre-read review:id like to sell my soul to a fate in exchange for this book to be in my hands right now please and thank youü•∫
