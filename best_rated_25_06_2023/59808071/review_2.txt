oh wow. i definitely loved this more than ‘once upon a broken heart.’ and im pretty sure im loving this series more than caraval. both statements are shocking to me because i loved them all so much.but this book is probably the best one SG has written. if you love characters that do everything they can other than admit their feelings, well, jacks and evagaline are the perfect couple for you. so much tension due to the hopelessness of the curse, but also the belief in a happy ever after. it creates such an engaging push and pull between them. and let me tell you what - the last 50 pages had me go through all seven stages of grief. the next book better fix that. lol. ↠ 5 stars
