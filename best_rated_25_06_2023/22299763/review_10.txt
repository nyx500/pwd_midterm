This might be my favorite book of all time. Itâ€™s heart wrenching and funny and well rounded and beautiful. The development and emotional journeys of all the characters are amazing. I was a sobbing mess by the end of this book and my heart felt heavy for hours afterward. (It is the next day and I'm still very emotionally frayed.)
