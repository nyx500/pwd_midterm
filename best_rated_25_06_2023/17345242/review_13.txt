My current state ( before publishing the book)After:Update:(Spoilers all over the place)Done waiting, didn't get much sleep though until I finished reading.First of all, I think we can all agree that we would rather read The Winds of Winter than this  But since there's nothing to be done about that, let all of us collectively (including me) stop hating on George and enjoy this great book.The world in which the Song of Ice and Fire takes place is HUGE and very very old!!As I said: HUGE!!!!So publishing a companion book is inevitable because there is no way that our favorite author can cover all the history and geography involved in his books.The book is written by a maester of the citadel, so naturally we don't get answers for everything, and sometimes the book even raises more questions than it answers  like the hints that a third race inhabited Westeros before the first men, the other two being the children of the forest and giants However he did expand on many things, such as Asshai, Yi Ti, we even get insight into the history of the Free Cities.And there were some timeline clarifications, and as a result some fan theories went up in flames  like the theory that Jaime and Cersei are Aerys's children, he was nowhere near Johanna Lannister when they were conceived , but it did fan the flames of another fan theory  Aerys was at Casterly rock in 272 and Tyrion was born in 273,while I'm not a fan of this theory at all, I have to admit that the dates make it possible As for Westeros, we get a very detailed history, starting with the Dawn Age and ending with Robert's reign.Plus the artwork is amazing, especially since it's how George envisions the world.I mean the Iron Throne on the show is cool and allBUT can it compete with this??????:Plus there are illustrations of all the great castles of Westeros,How cool is Dragonstone?!of some of the great battles,and of the faraway lands of Essos, my personal favorite: the mysterious AsshaiOh and did I mention DRAGONS!! The most important thing in this book might be the detailed listing of every Targaryen king.So whether you decide to read it cover to cover, or chapter by chapter according to your level of interest, The World of Ice and Fire is a must read for every fan of the original series.
