Okay, I like the movie better than the book. I mean I love watching all of my characters! So There! Anyhoo, I'm adding some pictures from the book. There are a lot of them but I'm just going to add a few. I thought they were wonderful. On the inside front and back pages there is a map but I only added one part of the map so you can get the idea =) Happy Reading! Mel â™¥MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List
