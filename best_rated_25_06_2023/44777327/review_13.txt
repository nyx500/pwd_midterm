4.25 stars TW: death of a loved one; suicidal thoughts; mentions of rape; fat phobic descriptionsI really enjoyed how this series wrapped up. This last book had so many loose ends finally come together, and so many pieces from the earlier books were brought back in. I really enjoy the main characters in this series but the side characters do sometimes fall a little flat for me. They aren’t completely two dimensional but I’m not as attached to them as I could be. I had some concerns about the possible fridging of a female character but overall it was handled well and I do think Sullivan does well with his female characters. He also makes some of his male characters THE WORST so it evens out. I would also like a tad more complexity to his villains but overall I really loved this series, I think it would us able to be pretty widely recommended for any fantasy fan, and I do plan to read more by him.
