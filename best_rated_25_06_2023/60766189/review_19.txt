Look. Was I really not gonna like this book? No. It’s 100% my shit, everything I wanted, it’s gay, it’s beautiful, it’s heartbreaking. A real leveling up from priory (which I also enjoyed) and everything I’ve been craving in fantasy. Yes it’s big. So what? Read it anyway. It’s worth the time. Plus it’s like getting two books in one.
