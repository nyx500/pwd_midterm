If Priory of the Orange Tree is like a loaded potato, A Day of Fallen Night is like a Dodger Dog: Distinguished by its length, you can only eat so much before you run out of bun and condiments. In the end, you're just left with too much dog.Long length seems to be becoming The Roots of Chaos' brand, which I don't necessarily dislike. There is a badge of pride and a sense of community that comes with completing such long books. But it comes down to quantity over quality. Does the story justify the length? Do the multiple POVs add or subtract? Do the character motivations make sense? Are they consistent or dynamic? Does it maintain its momentum? Is it balanced?I can confirm these things about Priory to an extent (not fully, as Parts III and IV drag and Loth’s POV didn’t carry the same narrative weight as the others), but not this one. It hit one note for me, one flavor - just too much dog.Also, it reads a bit like sitting over Samantha Shannon’s shoulder and watching her play tall in Crusader Kings 3 for hours on end. Not the worst thing, but tiresome after awhile.
