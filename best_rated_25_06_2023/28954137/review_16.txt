I...I'm...oh my Gods. 5*'s! All the stars! The end of the last story just I'm almost in tears ahhh! This was such a good bind up I'm so happy I finally read these short stories! Simon has always been one of my favourite characters and just reading about him at the academy made me so happy, I'm so content my heart is full, Sizzy has sailed again...ugh! I can't think of a single story in this that I didn't like, I loved the back story and all of the character development so much (Malec oh my Gods). I just have Lord of Shadows to read now and I'm all caught up with Cassandra Clare!
