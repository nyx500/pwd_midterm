A discussion with -currently my all things CC related advisor- my friend Jess ended up with me convinced that I have to read this one and that it can not be skipped and it looks like Jess was a 100% correct with this and I am glad I listened.The thing is short stories collections hardly work for me and I learned that the hard way. It seems that they are always stories that never add anything to what we already know and an easy way to milk the cow if I am being totally transparent here. What is different with this one is that the short stories are not that short (some takes an hour to read) and that they did in fact add many things to the plot and it was an actual continuation of the story rather than fillers.I was a fan of Simon in the first trilogy but then the second trilogy made me like him less but when it finished my love for him was restored and this book just cemented that love. I think Simon is a really cool nerd and I love that for him.I am not gonna discuss each story alone because I never do that and because better reviewers have already done that. My friend Melanie has an awesome review and I noticed that when it comes to the Shadowhunters world, we almost have the same ratings and thoughts. You can check her full review here.I initially had a book hangover after finishing The way of kings and the first couple of stories here were meh but then slowly everything got better and I was loving the stories and I almost went for 4 stars but the ending kind of ruined it for me. I am still salty and I think I will never get over it but c’est la vie!“We all change the world, with every day of living in it,” Magnus said. “You just have to decide HOW you want to change the world.”Summary: This book exceeded my expectations and I am glad I read it. I think it should not be skipped because it adds a lot to the other books. The only problem I had with it is the ending which I can not discuss without spoilers.
