I'm so happy I decided to reread these! While I of course loved these novellas the first time around, I felt I was able to connect to them better the second time. When I originally read them, I quickly forgot the individual stories but it feels so good to have the fresh in my mind.I would highly recommend the audiobooks for TFTSA. They're all narrated by a different voice actor and it really added to my reading experience. I had the best time rereading these and definitely feel ready for Lord of Shadows this May!
