5 Stars  and one broken heart I enjoyed each and every story of Simon's journey through Shadow hunter Academy. Simon's character really developed throughout the story from an unsure mundane who second guessed all of his relationships and despised his past self to a confident and capable shadow hunter.  Gutted that Simon's parabati ritual with Clary wasn't shown. I came to love all the new characters (even Jon haha). I really love the bromance between Simon and George and am gutted George didn't make it through the ascension seriously C. Clare that was cruel! Lovelace's don't seem to have an awful amount of luck so let's hope Simon can change all of that. I thought it was very sweet and really showed how much George meant to him to carry on his name. Need more stories about Clary, Jace, Simon, Izzy and Malec stories!
