I absolutely LOVED. THIS. BOOK. Now, I read Lady Midnight before this, not know it would spoil me a bit, but I still loved reading and learning about some of the backstory to the things I read about in LM! I was so happy to be with Simon again because Simon was easily one of my top three favs in The Mortal Instruments...hell, even in the entirety of The Shadowhunter Chronicles he's my favorite! What I also enjoyed about this bindup was how many flashbacks there were! We visited Will & Tessa, James Herondale, Robert Lightwood in the days of the Circle, and so many others! I really really loved reading about these past events and getting a look at a different perspective. And I even loved the new characters we were introduced to just as much! Marisol was easily one of my favorites along with George (which is probably a given with a lot of others.) I loved the humor and the sarcasm and everything about this book and this bindup and these stories. EVERYTHING.
