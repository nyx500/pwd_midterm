With this book Megan Whalen Turner has cemented herself as one of my all-time favorite writers. I absolutely loved "The Queen of Attolia" and "The King of Attolia" is a remarkable follow-up.Eugenides, the famous Thief of Eddis, is now the King of Attolia. He is married to the woman he loves but he doesn't enjoy the power that comes with it. Gen is despised by Attolians, they think him a lazy fool and a treacherous abuser of their Queen. But of course, things are not at all what they seem to be...The book is almost entirely written from the POV of Costis, an ordinary guard who at the opening of the book physically assaults the King. Instead of being executed, Costis is pardoned by Eugenides and soon even becomes one of his closest attendants and a center of various court intrigues. Slowly Costis, and we together with him, starts learning who his new King really is, the nature of Gen's relationship with his Queen and his schemes that are intended to reshape the landscape of Attolian politics.As Turner's previous book, "The King of Attolia" is filled with political intrigues and power play, this time almost exclusively within the Attolian court. Another excellent addition - Turner's examination of royal power and the nature of loyalty to the superiors - a very skillful and clever touch. The characters (I am mostly talking about Gen and Irene) still remain almost anonymous to us (as they are to Attolians), the narration is not overburdened with their emotional turmoils, but whatever we get a glimpse of - for instance, Gen's complicated relationship with his wife (we all know their history and they both are not quite over it) - is touching and deep. What else can I say? "The King of Attolia" is another masterful novel by Megan Whalen Turner. I expect I will enjoy "A Conspiracy of Kings" just as much.
