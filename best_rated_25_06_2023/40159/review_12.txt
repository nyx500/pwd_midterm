So fabulous. I absolutely love Turner's characters. Love them. And I think this book is the most brilliant of the trilogy. Each of them has a twist at the end, but really this one was the best. I wanted to hold it to my heart and sigh at its perfection when I finished it. And, oddly enough, I thought that I wouldn't like it! It's from the POV of a new character, and I wanted to get back inside Gen's head more. But it turned out better that way, because it made Gen's actions all the more surprising.Reread 2021: Too true, it's better to be inside Costis' head, to see Gen as the Attolians see him. So freaking great!
