Second read: 5⭐️Every time. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I’m feeling SO DOWN right now. Why must all good things come to an end? 😣This series keeps getting better and better with each book and Eugenides just keeps surprising me in ways I never see coming. Outstanding writing. Intricate political intrigue. A damn fine lead character whose brilliance and cunning ways leaves you wanting more... ughhh!👏🙌 SO. GOOD!
