Best book in the series alert! Best book in the series alert! So this is totally the best book in the series so far. Loooooved it.I don’t know if I’ve ever read a story before that had a romance like this that was so subtle, and yet so freakin complicated. I can’t help but feel a little uncomfortable about the relationship, but at the same time I am deeply moved by it. There’s no way to forget the past, not for these two, not with the harsh reminder they must live with every day -- but the way they do live with it touched me and had me rooting for them with all my heart.  Forgetting Costis standing nearby, forgetting possibly that anyone or anything else in the world existed, the king said shakily, “Tell me you won’t cut out my lying tongue, tell me you won’t blind me, you won’t drive red-hot wires into my ears.” After one moment of gripped immobility, the queen bent to kiss the king lightly on one closed eyelid, then on the other. She said, “I love your eyes.” She kissed him on either cheek, near the small lobe of his ear. “I love your ears, and I love”--she paused as she kissed him gently on the lips--”every single one of your ridiculous lies.”Introducing a new POV through guardsman Costis was a brilliant move on Turner’s part. We as readers already know what to expect from Eugenides (nothing is as it seems on the surface, nothing is an accident, not when Gen is involved.), so watching the story unfold through this new character’s eyes was a treat and it was great seeing how his perspective of Gen changed throughout the book.My favorite part:“You drop your point in third.”I LOVED the fight scenes at the end!! I was waiting and waiting throughout the whole freakin book for Eugenides to show ALL those motherfuckers what a badass swordsman he really was. The way it played out was fantastic, I loved every single second of it!
