Sometimes I just can't even with this series. Gen, Gen, Gen, only the most fully awesome, amazing, charming, sneaky little devil that you can't help but love. (That love that borders on if you were a real person, we would be total besties except only in my mind cause you're way too awesome to hang out with the likes of me. I'd probably end up being something closer to your stalker.) Attolia, whom we are getting lovely emotional growth from. More on her in the future.....Read the books, I beg of you! The writing is so brilliant. The plot\twist absurdly good. The characters perfectly flawed. Everything about this is wonderful.I had some trepidations about this one (as did quite a few others). I mean, Costis?? NOT Gen's POV?? What is this trickery? But it ended up being a brilliant move on MWT's part. It gave us an unique perspective of Gen, seeing him as others saw him and not how he saw himself. I wouldn't have this book written any other way. Not even to "see" Gen's thoughts. So to you, MWT: Fan Cast:I actually screamed when I saw this. I can't believe I never even thought of Katie McGrath before!! She's frelling perfect for the role!!Katie McGrath as AttoliaAneurin Barnard as Eugenides The source for this beauty.Fanmix - 1.  The Thief - Attolia
