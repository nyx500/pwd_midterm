I had forgotten what incredible range Terry Pratchett had as a writer, this addition to the City Watch series set in the Discworld, Night Watch is one of his absolute best, featuring one of my favourite characters, Sam Vimes, who amazingly gets to meet his younger rookie self. As he is chasing a serial killer in the present, only to be facing numerous pitfalls and challenges from the past, after a magical incident that occurs has him travelling back in time with the killer. There is heartbreak, philosophy and tragedy in this brilliant novel laden with humanity and an astute social and political commentary on the world that we live in, and which has Sam providing a mentoring role to his younger self. This is the last of the books in the series that I have reread, offered to readers by the publisher Random House Transworld, and I really cannot thank them enough for the opportunity to once again immerse myself in this superb fantasy series, which if you have never read, you are really missing out on.
