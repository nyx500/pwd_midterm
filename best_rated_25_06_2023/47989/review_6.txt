Terry Pratchett may have been the coolest writer on earth.Certainty one of the coolest.In 1969, Steve Winwood and his band mates in Blind Faith (some little known musicians named Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker and Ric Grech) sang these beautiful lyrics in the haunting song Can’t Find My Way Home.“Come down off your throne and leave your body aloneSomebody must changeYou are the reason I've been waiting all these yearsSomebody holds the keyWell, I'm near the end and I just ain't got the timeAnd I'm wasted and I can't find my way home”In 2002 Pratchett first published his 29th Discworld book, the hauntingly beautiful Night Watch, in which we gentle readers learned that heroic as Sam Vimes was before, Pratchett had not yet demonstrated to what degree of heroism was this character drawn.Exploring themes of leadership, identity, revolution and justice Nigh Watch is at once one of Pratchett’s most satisfying Discworld novels and perhaps it’s most somber and dark.There are still plenty of smiles, some laughs, but Pratchett, taking a page from the Dickens playbook of vilifying what is villainous and making courageous what is valiant at it heart, demonstrates his great range of writing ability. Sam Vimes, while chasing a murderous bad guy, is flung back in time to when he had first joined the Watch, amidst tensions that threatened to tear his city apart.Buried amidst each Terry Pratchett Discworld are golden nuggets of cultural references – readers can search and find them and have fun like kids on Easter Sunday finding eggs. My favorite here were two jewels of PINK FLOYD and THE WHO references. One of his best.
