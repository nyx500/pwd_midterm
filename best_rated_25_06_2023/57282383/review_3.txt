I reallyyy wanted to love this one more, but I sadly had a hard time even getting into the story. It almost felt like From Blood and Ash 2.0. We get more background on the world... but it was about things I didn't care about, besides maybe the drakens. I loved Nyktos' appearance in TCOGB but I didn't fall in love with his character here. The romance felt underwhelming – it's hard not to compare to the original series, but Sera and Nyktos just weren't as exciting as Poppy and Cas were. I'm hoping future books will get me more invested but for now, this is just an okay book.Also, I gotta say the ending was incredibly predictable. How many times did they talk about Sera's shroud? Come on.***We’re getting a Blood & Ash prequel series! JLA is too good to us.
