EXCUSE ME. I am shook. Yâ€™all this book. It just kept getting better and better. I loved every single moment of it. And JLA was right, I am trash for Nyktos now.This is the first book in a prequel series to From Blood and Ash, and I must sayâ€”I think itâ€™s a must read, even if youâ€™d rather just skip it for more Poppy and Casteel. Trust me! There are revelations and events in this book that directly tie to Poppy and Casteelâ€™s time and I learned so much that has me even more excited to see how that information plays into the next From Blood and Ash book. You might even see a familiar face or two. ðŸ˜‰I immediately fell in love with Nyktos and love how much his story with Sera paralleled Poppy and Casteelâ€™s. At first, I was a little unsure, but when I realized why the stories were similar I was SHOOK. I had to set my book aside for a few minutes and just breath. I was NOT expecting that and I have so many questions now about what that means for the other books!? *flails*The romance in this has just the perfect amount of angst and JLA is the queen of giving us little tastes of whatâ€™s to come before fully diving in. Some moments in this book are straight up fiery. I remember JLA saying she thought Nyktos would give Casteel a run for his money and I have to be honestâ€”not only do I feel it, I see it too. *whew* There is a battle in the second half of this book in which Nyktos was giving me serious Geralt vibes and I was GLUED to my book. Yes, he has those broody, mysterious alpha hero vibes but he also gives off vibes like heâ€™s the only adult in the room and he knows it. Like, there is no question he can get the job done. I loved seeing a hero that had those alpha qualities but was also incredibly mature too. Itâ€™s hard to explain, but it totally worked for me. Needless to say, highly recommend this one if you love From Blood and Ash (of course) or other steamy fantasy romance reads like Sarah J Maas, Danielle L Jensen, Laura Thalassa, Raven Kennedy, Scarlett St. Clair, and even Katee Robert. I would still recommend starting with From Blood and Ash before reading this, as I think it gives a better intro into the world, but I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll be disappointed if you enjoy the genre or the authors above!Thank you to Blue Box Press and Social Butterfly PR for the opportunity to read A Shadow in the Ember early!As a side note, Iâ€™ve seen several DNF reviews since release from people upset that Sera and Nyktosâ€™ story seems to parallel Poppy and Casteelâ€™s journey too much. Yâ€™all. Thatâ€™s intentional. You need to finish the book. (Also, itâ€™s okay for authors to write stories that are similar to other stories of theirs. The romance genre as a whole mostly follows straightforward plot formulas â€¦ that isnâ€™t so much what is happening here, but similarities between an authorâ€™s work isnâ€™t a sign of bad writing. Itâ€™s literally how we identify what a genre even is.)
