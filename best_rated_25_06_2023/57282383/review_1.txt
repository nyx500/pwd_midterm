i was already excited for the sequel, but this reread is only hyping me up more. i still lose my mind over all of the foreshadowing connected to the main series! so, so good. ________________________________the queen does not miss. 🙌🏻i honestly dont know what to say that i havent said already. my whole mind, body, and soul belongs to every book written in this fantasy universe. im obsessed with the chemistry and development of JLAs characters, but its the actual plot and world-building that has me fangirling this time around. omg. the prophecy! the foreshadowing of things i already know because of the main series! the layered effect of it all! seriously so so so good. ive said it before and i will say again - these books are the best thing JLA has written (and ive read 39 of her books). definitely career defining material. ↠ 5 stars
