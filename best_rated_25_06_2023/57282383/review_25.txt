This might be another’s cup of tea if you’re looking for a story and couple dynamic nearly the same as Poppy and Cas, but it wasn’t for me. The reuse of lines and plots felt boring and uninspired to me. There were so many other aspects I didn’t like as well, but I don’t care to go into them in all honesty. I won’t be reading on with this series, but I will with FBAA!Seems like my love for FBAA (primarily book 1) was a one hit wonder between JLA & I... :(
