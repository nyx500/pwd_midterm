I want to be called “something beautiful and powerful” so bad…..This was really good actually. The world-building, the characters, and the plot were interesting enough for me to finish the book. However, overall, there was still this sense of dragging and dullness.The beginning parts of this were too predictable for my liking but this was made up to me when we got a lot of shocking revelations in the proceeding parts. Serafina was really cool. I just found her too similar to poppy. Yes, they are related but come on! Her relationship with her family, in the beginning, was really troubling. I instantly connected with her because I was just as angry with her. Will I be reading the next book? Unfortunately, yes.
