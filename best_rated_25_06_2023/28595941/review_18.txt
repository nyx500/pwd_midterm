Fantastic collection of stories, a must for all cosmere enthusiasts. I love the diary entries by Khriss for each world, it gives you such a deeper insight into Sandersons cosmere and the sheer potential for all the systems involved. It boggles the mind as to just how epic Sanderson's world is and speaks volumes that he can write consistently at a high level. All of the stories within are worth reading, Edgedancer and Mistborn Secret History are the best but there is not a dud story in this collection. One I think I'll have to read again once I read Bands of Mourning and then the original Mistborn trilogy, then the second Stormlight book again before the third comes out, and then reading Elantris again...argh! There's so much Sanderson to reread and so little time!!!
