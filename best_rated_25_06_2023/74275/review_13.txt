I loved Luck in the Shadows, but for me this book was on a whole other level. Stalking Darkness took us to new places in this world and the relationships grew even more. Seregil and Alec's in particular was perfect, their banter, fights and reconciliations. Here, we see their relationship move to another level, where in the first book it was just hinted at.The plot was strong; striking a nice balance with the characters. The stakes are also higher making the story more intense.I'm really looking forward reading Traitor's Moon, I miss Seregil and Alec already! (Do they have a ship name? Serec, Alegil?)
