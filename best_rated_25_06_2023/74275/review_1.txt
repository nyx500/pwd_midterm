I'm of two minds about this book. It is good fantasy adventure. There is a good pace to the adventure, and while some of the world may have been a bit foggier than other books in this genre, I did enjoy the quests, magic, and intrigue.HOWEVER, I was really, really bothered by the romantic relationship between the two main characters. It isn't about the homosexual part of it (though that did suprise me when I was 16). The problem I had with this was the age and social maturity difference between the coupling. When I was 16 first reading this I denouced Seregil as a pedophile, guilty of emotional incest, and felt personally betrayed when the hero who I'd been cheering on for 2 books turned out to be a sex offender. To explain the insest thing, I always felt that Seregil had defacto adopted Alec as a surrogate brother.I'm nearing 30 now, and I reread the books recently. I'm less quick to denouce Seregil, and am able to feel a little more, to-each-his-own about it. But, there remains something wrong about the relationship. If I were friend to the people involved I would council them to give it more time for their maturity levels to normalize before jumping into a relationship with such a dramatic imbalance in the power dynamic. I know that the current hot trend is age-old vampires sexing up teenage girls, and that is somehow considered acceptable, but I will continue to question any relationship based on such unstable initial footing. Would I recommend this book? Yes, but only to mature readers. Those who have a firm grip on the difference between right and wrong.
