I just realized I forgot to add a whole bunch of Lynn's books to my shelf. WTF!This is my favorite Alec & Seregil book; also the first one I read; also the one I read the most. Probably a good solid dozen times, if not more. It has all the right ingredients. A noble rogue, an innocent coming-of-age youth with a hidden streak of a rake, all sorts of sex, an ancient evil with some rather disgusting elements, magic, both good and dark and twisted, proper chase and adventure, warfare that is realistic and cruel, a colorful balance of main characters, wizards, geography, history, culture, hidden identities, court flair, and then some.I think it's also better than Luck in the Shadows, because our two heroes are well established, and they are comfortable in their guise, wealth and modus operandi. The never-ending war between Skala and Plenimar serves an excellent backdrop to the story. As it turns out, Lynn writes in a style that could be defined as borderline-YA, however, she excels when she goes dark magic as she did in this book and the last installment (see my review).In a way, it's the 90s Locke Lamore with a twist. Lynn definitely has a unique style and she did an all-male cast (in the true sense) way before it was popular in the fantasy genre, and not because it was needed, but because it gave her story a special depth and scale. You might find it naive at times, but then, it surprises you with sudden, unexpected, morbid delight.Extremely recommended.Nightrunners are back in town,A hidden letter, a silken gown,Blood in a bowl,A piercing howl,Seriamaius must not wear his crown.Igor
