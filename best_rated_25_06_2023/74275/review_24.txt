This is the second installment in the Nightrunner series, and I enjoyed it even more than the first. Lord Seregil of Rhiminee and his apprentice, Alec of Kerry continue their undercover work, meet a new circle of friends, and get embroiled in a new set of adventures and intrigue. The characterization is excellent and the story continues to be riveting. A series well worth reading!
