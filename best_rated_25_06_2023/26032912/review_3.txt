Reread 01/23: Easily one of my all-time favourite series. I just adore everything about it."By you, I am forever undone."Was this series the most perfectly-plotted? The most unique? Did it break any new ground? No to all of the above. But I read every page of this with my heart pounding and a lump in my throat-- how many perfectly-plotted, unique and ground-breaking books can I say that about?These books are a serious addiction for me. I have been obsessing over this conclusion for over a year and imagining so many wonderful and awful ways it could end. I wasn't disappointed. It was thrilling, (mostly) satisfying, and VERY HOT  though I could have done without the tail, personally ðŸ˜‚. I am in that perfect blissful misery that us readers know all too well... feeling wonderful because I have just read a book I loved, and feeling depressed because what the hell do I do with myself now? ðŸ˜­Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube
