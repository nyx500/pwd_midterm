4.5 starsI gulped it down in a matter of a few hours (and some chapters *cough*21*cough* I may have read a few times), and while I am currently a little hazy on the details of The Queen of Nothing, I am left with a sense of satisfaction and peace. This series is a success, IMO. I am not going to get into details of the plot. The fact that I couldn't stop reading/listening to this story speaks for itself (alternatively, I couldn't wait NOT to read The Toll anymore just a week ago). The biggest triumph of this story is undoubtedly my favorite ship of the last few years - Jude and Cardan. There are some twists and turns in The Queen of Nothing, but the biggest of them all is how healthy this relationship grows to be. Who could have guessed? I still don't know how Holly Black managed to pivot it this way. I had expected much more drama after the ending of The Wicked King, but what I got was... more and better.There is a couple of gripes I do have. I feel that there is a lot left unsaid about Taryn. Maybe there is a short story in the works? I wouldn't want a full novel though. And the bigger one which people will probably be complaining the most - the resolution of the final conflict is too drawn out and too transparent to warrant the page time. A lot of Black's books suffer from this same affliction. But I rate books based on my gut feeling. And my gut and my heart are happy and a little nostalgic already. I can't wait to reread it over and over again.P.S. It may be a sick thing to say, but how is it that this teen (!) novel is hotter than all the romances that I've read or attempted to read this year?
