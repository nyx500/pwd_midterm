Just posted my Goodreads Choice 2020 Reaction Video on Booktube! Click the link to check it out!!As a heads up, I got my copy from Owl Crate - a truly wonderful book subscription box. A favorite for special editions.* Is it just me, or was the box particularly brilliant this round?Because, wow. It was incredible. Especially the little spoons. And the gorgeous beetle pin.I just couldn't handle it.*not a sponsor, just a fan.His eyes are black with desire. "By you, I am forever undone.‚ÄùJude, the mortal Queen of Faerie, is exiled to the human realm by the King Cardan.She's convinced that this punishment is intended to go on indefinitely and begins taking odd jobs - including one involving a cannibalistic faerie.But then her sister comes back - Taryn, who commits an unspeakable act and is now on trial for her life. Jude is the only mortal that Taryn can turn to - and with Jude's ability to resist glamour and lie, maybe, just maybe both sisters will survive.Ahhh. What a satisfying end to a fabulous series. My heart cannot be fuller.So many wonderfully twisty and twisted moments. Come home and shout at me. Come home and fight with me. Come home and break my heart, if you must.So many darkly wicked moments with Cardan.That boy is your weakness.Ahhh. If only it was longer. ps. I f*cking knew it. Queen of Faerie. Pardoned by the crown. Jude, you really are an idiot. YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
