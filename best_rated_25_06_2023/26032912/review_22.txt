((crying all the tears))It is done.In this final installment of The Folk of the Air trilogy, we find Jude back in the mortal world, trying to recover from the events of The Wicked King.Her heart is hurt, her alliances smashed to bits, but as our girl Jude is apt to do, she is solely focused on getting back what she has lost. Her strong will and strength of spirit are definitely characteristics we can get behind.Unexpectedly, her annoying sister, Taryn arrives, pleading for Jude's help. She has done something terrible and sees Jude as her only path to salvation. Surprise, surprise.How convenient for her.This help requires Jude sneaking back into the Faerie Court under the guise of being Taryn. What could possibly go wrong?Once there, Jude finds Elfhame on the brink of war, with the political class and society in general running amok. Can Jude save her sister and her power before everything is ruined?I'm sad, man. Yes, everything was wrapped up, but this felt so quick; too quick. I needed more time with my babies! Why you play me like this, Holly Black?I'll be honest, I feel like I didn't retain much of this story. Completely not the book's fault. I was just so anxious to know how it was going to turn out, I flew through it.I definitely plan to reread this entire series at some point, to really soak it in. With this being said, I do wish this installment had been a bit longer.I came away feeling like this portion of the story felt very surface level. I wanted it to go deeper. This could be me just being hurt that it has come to an end, however.Either way, a great series overall. So glad that I read it and look forward to reading them all again at some point.
