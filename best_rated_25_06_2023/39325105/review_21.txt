welcome to 202-Queer ðŸŒˆâœ¨, the year where i only read queer books and finally have fun ðŸŒˆâœ¨i'm happy to report that i understood EVERYTHING that happened in HTN and i have no questions left because the plot was perfectly clear and very easy to follow and everyone who says i googled a reddit summary is lying and jealous of my geniusdid i like Gideon the Ninth? no. has this book been haunting me in my dreams whispering read me Jonathan, read me? yes. you gotta do what you gotta do.personally - and i know many people disagree with this - i think this series' strength lies in its writing. it's just absolutely unhinged. you will never, NEVER, read writing like this in any other book. it's just really convoluted and messy - but in a good way - and it literally gives zero fucks. i'm a big fan and the writing is holding half my brain capacity hostage at any given time.now the ploti have read two books set in this world. do i know what a lyctor is? fuck no!!! why is God named "John"?? do i remember a single character name? also no! .. but then again that's like not unique to this book series, i can only remember like one, maybe two characters max on a good day from any book series this will have a reveal that's like "look it's xyz!! they're alive!!" and I'm like "who" and "were they dead"honestly i forgot what i was talking about. this will haunt my nightmares. 4 stars
