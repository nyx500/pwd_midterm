UPDATE 25/09/22 - Reread in preparation to read Nona the Ninth! Wowsers! Even on a reread I was still scratching my head in some places. Absolutely loved it!Original reviewWell I can't put my thoughts together properly yet, and if I am being honest, it might not be until after I have re-read both books. I can't emphasise enough how incredible Tamsyn Muir's writing is in all it's descriptive, foul mouthed glory. I know the overly descriptive stuff won't work well for everyone but I absolutely loved it! The seemingly overworked sentences are essential to the style of humour Muir has mastered - the intelligent, insult laden type that had me in stitches. I will write a review but I have to think about it as I need to keep it spoiler free. I recommend Fiona's  or Nataliya's reviews as they are excellent! Love love love this series!
