If you enjoyed Gideon, I firmly believe you’ll love Harrow as well. While Harrow doesn’t have Gideon’s humor, what she does bring to the table in pure sass is truly enjoyable. Harrow, who was clearly the strongest character in the first book, is the underdog in her own story. We see her struggle and grow and I enjoyed every bit of it, even the confusing parts. If you made it through Gideon and still liked the book, then you’re prepared to read Harrow the Ninth. Much like Gideon, the first 60% is supposed to be confusing. But unlike Gideon, you now have an idea of the world building, which you get very little of in the first book. For me that made all the difference and I managed to read Harrow twice as quickly because I wasn’t grappling for the “rules” of the universe. This entire series forces me to really put trust in the authors hands and accept what I cannot control. Loved this book. Cannot wait for the third. It’s my favorite series of the year, easily. I’ve never read books like these before and I do not expect to find anything like them again.
