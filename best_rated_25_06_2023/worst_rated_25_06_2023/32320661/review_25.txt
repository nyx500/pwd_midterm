Buddy Read marathon with Scrill :)_________________________________ "Your voice is an hour's rose; your soul a loving thief. I'll follow you through the fledgling woods, till your heart is mine to keep." With vibes of Snow White and definitely a fairy tale-esque feel I was quickly swept away into the land of Sempera. Here time is of the essence, literally. Your time is payment for anything you might need, and ruling over the land is the Queen and the wealthy Gerlings who have time in abundance stored away in vault that is kept well guarded. Poor folk like Jules and her father do what they can to get by and when her father's time is running low she goes to desperate measures to save him. Returning to the Gerling estate to work for blood coins to send back to her father, she soon realizes she might be in over her head. And there are many more secrets behind the castle's walls than she remembered there being as a child. From the beginning I really enjoyed this story, like I said, I was instantly swept up trying to puzzle out all the mysteries and wanting to find out along with Jules what exactly  is  happening with these rich and elite, because something is definitely amiss. Jules was an interesting character to follow, she did seem a bit dumb at times, doing exactly what she was told not to the ENTIRE book. But because of her hard-headedness she found out much about herself and the people around her. She refused to be put aside, or pushed away. And in that respect, I kind of liked her. But there were many many times when I felt the urge to reach in the book and shake some sense into her because she was frustrating me so much. Everything was well written and I was really getting into the story but then towards the end, it all started to feel a bit rushed. I remember holding the last few pages in my hands and thinking, theres no way that it can all be wrapped up in this little amount of book left. But it all led up to one MAJOR cliffhanger that has me needing the next book ASAP! I also feel like quite a few of the characters who were introduced to us throughout the book that could have been major key players, just dropped off the map. There were too many loose ends to feel really satisfied with the way the book wrapped up. I do hope that there is more to come, because I need to know if Liam and Jules ever meet again, and if they do, how that will turn out. THAT ENDING!!! UGH! I will be waiting eagerly to find out what happens next to these characters! You can find the review on the blog here:Full review can be found on my blog, here.Blog | Bookstagram | Instagram | Twitter
