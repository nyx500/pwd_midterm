DNF @157 This conversation probably will happen when I have grandchild in the future.Me: *reads a book on a couch*My Grandchild : Grandma!Me: Yes, my dear?My Grandchild: Will you tell me a story, please? Me: *puts the book down*Me: Alright, I'll tell you a story. My Grandchild: *sits down on a couch beside me eagerly*Me: Once upon a time, there was a girl who loved reading books so much or rather too much. She spent all her free time by reading books, because she thought there was no better companion than books. But her great weakness was books with beautiful covers. She just could not resist the temptation to not buy them. One day, when she went to a bookstore, she saw this beautiful book and she could not resist it, so she begged her mother to buy a copy for her, because she had no money left from buying too many books and when her mother bought it for her, she was beyond grateful and excited and a few days passed and she finally read the book, she was very excited to read it, because the synopsis of the book sounded good and like something she would read but then day by day, she realized the book was not like what she expected. My Grandchild: *gasps* was the book bad, Grandma?Me: My dear, the book was beyond bad. It was awful and disappointing. Let me continue it. She realized the book was not like what she expected. She expected an action-packed story but the book did not give her that. The book gave her information and information, not the action scenes, she expected. The plot was boring, but she still thought it was fine and she still gave the book more chance, but then the girl was tired of waiting what might came, because she did not feel any connection to the story and to the characters. So, she closed the book with disappointed sigh and it was even painful for her to just look at the book, because the book had crushed her expectations and only left disappointment for her. My Grandchild: Grandma? Me: Yes, sweetie? My Grandchild: The girl in the story, she is you, isn't she? Me: Yes, my dear. She is me. My Grandchild: Do you still have the book, Grandma?Me: I don't know, sweetie. I don't even care for that book anymore. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~REVIEW TO COME TOMORROW. I just can't continue reading it. I am so freaking disappointed right now. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The cover is absolutely GORGEOUS! I hope the story is as good as the cover or even better. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
