4.5 STARS!!!!Buddy read with someone who hates Roan's timestopping eyesEverless is one of my most anticipated release of 2018 and boy was the wait absolutely worth it?!!?!?I finished this so fast and I was sucked right in from the very first page. I honestly need the next book right now like wtf ✨What I liked ✨1.The world-building YASSSSSS YAS YAS YASSS I LOVE THE PLOT AND THE STORY AND THE WORLDBUILDING I LOVE IT SO MUCH I MEAN TIME AS MONEY? YES YES YES2.The mystery I was so invested in what is ya know the boom boom pow that my head spun so many theories and what ifs..... and I was actually spot on ok that was scary I think I’m a psychic3.LIAM LIAM DADDYYYYYYY TAKE ME BABY BOY I MEAN HELLO? BEAUTIFUL BLACK HAIRED MALE CHARACTERS RUINS MY LIFE AND I’D HAPPILY LET LIAM GERLING RUIN MINE. 4.The Romance (MILD SPOILER) The reason why I loved the romance because shit hits home. I personally relate to how Jules felt about Roan. Because I had a childhood best friend who I was in love and eventhough he changed, it took me years to figure out that I was in love with the memory of a better time and the thought of him instead of who he is now. Jules might say that she loves him but in reality, she was just fantasizing her past and who Roan was as a child and not the man he is now. Truthfully, Jules doesn't even know who Roan grew up to become. And I noticed by how she always talk about when Roan was a kid and not how he is now. That's because Jules was in love with the thought of himHonestly I had to pause and get a bit emotional because how the author portray this kind of romance was so accurate that it hits home so close that it got a bit hard to read. But boy I fucking loved it. ✨What I didn’t like✨1.The pacing It might get a bit boring in the middle because it spans so long without action. And I feel the ending was a bit rushed but it was still bomb .comOverall I want Liam Gerling’s brooding sexy ass and the next book by tomorrow. Thank youand p.s Roan deserved that, bitch ass cheating fuckboy
