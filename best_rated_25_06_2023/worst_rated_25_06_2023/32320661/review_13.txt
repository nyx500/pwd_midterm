“It’s possible to feel joy and grief at the same time. It’s possible to look forward to the horizon while mourning what you’ve lost.”  Story ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️In our world time is money. But what if money isn’t bound to our time, but our life. What if every drop of blood makes us weaker, older? What if we can give a few years to someone we love only to make us die younger? In Jules life her family is losing time faster than anything. So she decides to go back to the place she ones lived - Everless - and help prepare a wedding for the princess. But when she sets food into Everless again - after years of fleeing from it - she’s pushed into a dangerous world full of intrigue and blood. Even though I had some problems with the story and the way of storytelling, I think the book was really good. All in all there could’ve been a better execution of such an amazing idea, but some parts were pretty brilliantly (the ending!). I know that many readers say that they knew what was happening, that this book was so predictable, but I was pretty surprised about the ending. My favorite part were the last 30% of the book, because finally something big and dangerous happened. Character ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️I wasn’t really sure about Jules. I liked the way she was brave and always tried to care and save the people surrounding her. But then she was also terribly naive and too trusting. She never really thought about the consequences of her doing (especially in the end). But still she was really likable in some way. My favorite character - even though I don’t really have one - was Liam. I always have a weak spot for the “bad” mean guy. I’m not even sorry about it. In the end they’re always the most interesting. I mean look at the love interest - Liam - he was handsome, sure thing, kind and had a dazzling smile but I had the feeling he was as naive as Jules and had a touch of a bad side (I mean guys like him aren’t the most loyal ones, huh? Especially when described like this. There’s nothing clearly mentioned in this book, but I still had a really really bad feeling). Then there are also a few characters I couldn’t quite place. Ina, the queen, Caro etc. They seemed interesting, but I think they weren’t really developed much, they seemed a little plain. World ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “The alchemist turned earth into lead and lead into gold. The sorceress made flowers bloom in winter. But the alchemist - who lived at this estate grew jealous. So he imprisoned them and demanded they discover a way to make him immortal as he’d seen the sorceress do with flowers and trees. It was deep in his forest estate that the sorceress wove time into blood, and the alchemist found a way to bind blood to iron.”  Do you want to life forever? Or at least a while longer? Then you should probably be rich and have a ton of blood-iron in your castle. Because that’s what the Gerlings at Everless have - tons and tons of blood-iron. And the queen is like a nearly immortal ghost with a touch of ice that drains the life out of you. I really liked the world building in it. It wasn’t perfect, there could’ve have been so much more, but it was still really interesting. Relationships ⭐️⭐️⭐️Oh, well. Some people would say there is a love triangle in this one - but I’m not really sure of it. I don’t want to spoiler you - so I won’t use names (I hope that helps a bit). I didn’t really like the love interest in the first 80 % of the book. I guess I understand the whole childhood friends thing, but they didn’t see each other for years and she’s still madly in love with him? Oh please, that was your imagination, girl. Obviously. But then the second part (or the last 20%) it seemed that Jules got an idea of real love. She sees who her real friends and enemies are. I liked the way her relationships changed and she couldn’t quite place her feelings. Writing style ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️There were some beautiful, interesting parts. Especially the fairy tales in this one.But there was also a lot of descriptive writing that encouraged a slow pacing and with it a little bit of boredom and lose of interest on my side. But still, the world was awesome and I wanted to see what happens in the end. And what can I say? I was pretty invested in this book and the characters. And why? Because I think this book had a huge potential, and even though it didn’t use all of it, it still made a good impression. In the end I can’t wait to read the next book. 📚Btw. I guess there is a guy that has a tiny bit of resemblance with Warner. (but no one is as wonderful and awesome as Warner, duh) _______________________________________________________I heard there is a character similar to Warner from Shatter me? *silently freaking out*Hell yeah, I need to read this now.Also, look at this gorgeous bookish Trailer ♥️
