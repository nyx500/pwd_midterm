3.35/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf 🐺First things first, this world that Sara Holland has created is kind of untouchable. It is an interesting concept of a timeless world in which the most valuable thing is, you guessed it, time. People are born with time in their veins, time that can be extracted, materialized into blood-iron and then ingurcitated like it is effervescent vitamin C. Quite an interesting concept, I might say I declare myself a fan. But the whole atmosphere is just kind of sad if you ask me. And uncomfortable. I would hate to live in a world where I need to cut open my palms in order to get currency to survive. Ick. No, thank you.Even though I felt kinda into the book while reading it, I have to admit that I couldn’t really feel anything about the characters. I didn’t have much connection to any of them and the least of connection I’ve had with the main character, Jules Ember. I couldn’t quite grasp Jules' personality throughout the book. I really felt like it went missing at some point (the personality, I mean). She always experienced so many emotions, but she never expressed them but chose to shove them in some corner of her being and keep the obedient servant attitude on. My girl, if you feel that something is unfair, you shout it out!! You’re the main character, you’re not dying, trust me.Even though there are certain things that I wasn’t a fan of throughout the book, it was kind of enjoyable overall, at least for me. But some parts were so full of blah tbh...I am looking forward to reading the next book as soon as I find it. I do hope that after reading the next one, the whole Everless mass of feeling in my mind is going to get a better contour. So, for the Everless Duology, I have a message – You better shape up, ‘cuz I need a book who can keep me satisfied.
