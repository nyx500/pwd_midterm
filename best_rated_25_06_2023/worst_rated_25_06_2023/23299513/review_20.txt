2.5 stars(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to HarperCollins and Edelweiss.)“You need to trust that I know what I’m doing.” Her voice was firm. “If you can’t trust me in this, how can you trust me to face Irina or rule an entire kingdom?”There wasn’t anything horribly wrong with this book, I just didn’t enjoy it.I felt quite sorry for both Kol and Lorelai in this story, both were put in difficult positions, and both had to try and make hard decisions for the good of their people.The storyline in this was about Lorelai trying to find a way to defeat the evil queen and take her kingdom back, and about Kol trying to save his own people by asking the evil queen for help. I just found the story to be really slow though, and for me it dragged and dragged. I think this was probably a case of wrong person, wrong book, but I just didn’t enjoy the book much at all.The ending to this was a happily ever after, and it was a satisfying ending, I just wish I had enjoyed getting there more than I did.5 out of 10
