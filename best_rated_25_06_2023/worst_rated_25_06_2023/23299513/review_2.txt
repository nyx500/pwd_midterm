Irina’s smile disappeared. “I don’t require all of the princess, huntsman.”A chill raced over Kol’s skin. “I don’t understand. Our oath said—”She leaned forward, her eyes pinning Kol where he stood. “You agreed to do whatever I asked of you. And I am asking you to bring me the princess’s heart.”I feel like this book wants to be a mixture of Snow White and the Huntsman and the Grisha series and failed spectacularly at both, not least because it was so jaw-achingly dull. You've got your terrifyingly long Russian-sounding names (Kolvanismir Arsenyevnek, really?) random-ass magic that was never really explained, ogres, shape-shifting dragons, and...well, this.“Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the most powerful of them all?”Commence eye-rolling.This book is generic and boring, there's no denying it. The main character is beautiful, of course.The girl’s brown eyes were guarded. She had a smudge of dirt on one pale cheek, and her long dark curls were tangled from her sprint through the village, but even so, she was beautiful in a way that made Kol want to keep looking.And, she can fight and do other things. Blah blah blah.The girl’s brown eyes were guarded. She had a smudge of dirt on one pale cheek, and her long dark curls were tangled from her sprint through the village, but even so, she was beautiful in a way that made Kol want to keep looking.Retellings are supposed to be familiar, but in order for them to be successful, it has to either have spectacular writing, or provide a different element to the original tale. This book is your general YA high fantasy/retelling and nothing more.Read this review and more @ The Book Eaters
