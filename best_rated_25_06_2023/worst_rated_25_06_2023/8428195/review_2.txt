I need to re-read Wildwood Dancing to cleanse my brain of the mess that is Entwined. This book has one really fabulous idea. That idea is the description and significance of the Entwine, a fictional court dance where the gentleman and lady begin at opposite ends of a sash. The gentleman tries to 'entwine' the lady, while the lady spends the dance avoiding such capture. It was clever and witty and I wished there was more magic integrated with dance in this book, but alas, it was not to be had.I hate to seem mean-spirited, but that was everything that I found appealing about this book--it's potential. It is set in some pseudo-historical society, period ambiguous. Horses were named after English writers (Dickens and some others) which I found 'cutesy'. And do not get me started on the magic. Confusing and not very compelling.None of the characters stood out to me, either, which was a real shame. They were all bland and lukewarm, all except Keeper, who went from a possibly intriguing enigma to a cartoonish villain. All of the twelve princesses (yes, twelve, and yes, princesses) had flower names in ALPHABETICAL ORDER which reminds me of that Ann M. Martin book I read when I was 9, Ten Kids, No Pets, or something. All of the younger princesses blended together in my mind with no difference in personality. Worst of all was the pacing. At nearly 500 pages, the first two thirds was spent about these princesses not being able to dance because they were in mourning after their mother passes away in childbirth, WHINE WHINE WHINE. Not a single one of them was self-aware, not even the oldest. I think the author tried too hard to focus on the 'fairytale' portion and not the 'retelling', and it's simply too hard to novelize a fairytale into nearly 500 pages without some sort of depth. I skimmed the rest of it. Yuck. Pretty much the only thing this book has going for it is the cover, which is very pretty.
