Somehow three different novelizations of The Twelve Dancing Princesses have come my way in the last three or four months: this book, Princess of the Midnight Ball and Wildwood Dancing. (None of them is perfect, but I liked Wildwood Dancing the best.) I'm going to repeat here a lot of what I said in my review about Midnight Ball: This book will appeal mostly to girls in the 10-16 age range, I think. It was a pleasant read but nothing special. It's longer and more complex than Midnight Ball, but is rather simplistically and yet somewhat confusingly told. As much as I'm predisposed to like fairy tale novelizations, it just didn't really grab me.
