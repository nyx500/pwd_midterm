“The heaviest burdens are those you bear alone.” Zinnia who is turning 21, has a rare condition that causes protein to build up in her lungs. For her 21st birthday Zinnia’s best friend Charm gives her a Sleeping Beauty themed birthday party in a tall tower since Zinnia loves Sleeping Beauty. When Zinnia pricks her finger, she is transported to a different world where she meets another sleeping beauty who is in trouble and wants to escape her fate. Along the way she helps her new friend and tries to escape her own fate. This book was a beautiful, feminist retelling of Sleeping Beauty about love, fate and second chances. I really liked the characters in this short story, especially Zinnia, Charm and Primrose. They each had a unique personality that enhance the beauty of the book. Zinnia is caring, helpful and courageous. Charm is funny, smart and loyal. Primrose is brave, kind. I really appreciated the lesbian representation in this book. I also appreciated that this book brought a new perspective to the story of Sleeping Beauty, it was very refreshing and I enjoyed learning about Zinnia’s story. I loved the author’s voice in this book it was unique and beautiful. I was glad that the author brought up important topics such as sexual identity and illness. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, Disney and Sleeping Beauty retellings.
