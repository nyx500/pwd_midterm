Zinnia Gray was born with a genetic disease that kills most people before they reach 21. She has always known she will die and as a child became obsessed with the tale of Sleeping Beauty, a dying girl, waiting to be woken by a kiss from a charming prince. On her 21st birthday Zinnia’s best friend Charmaine (Charm for short) throws her a Sleeping Beauty themed birthday party in an abandoned tower complete with a spinning wheel. When she pricks her finger on the spindle, she finds herself face to face with a fairytale princess in a tower, needing to be rescued.Alix E. Harrow has a lot of fun with this fractured, subversive fairytale. Zinnia’s modern sensibilities, sarcastic asides and feminist views are woven into the fairytale tropes as she takes on a wicked witch, a handsome prince and other fairytale characters . A short novella that was a pleasure to read.
