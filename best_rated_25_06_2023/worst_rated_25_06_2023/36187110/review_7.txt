2.5 starsWanted to love this one but struggled to connect to its writing and characters. I most enjoyed the elements of class conflict and family strife. C.L. Polk writes about class privilege and servitude well, and the tension between our main character, Miles, and his family helped imbue Witchmark with surprise, intrigue, and betrayal. However, as other reviewers have said, the book reads like fanfiction at times, where the characters and world-building receive little development and the writing contains several tropes. I wanted the characters to feel more distinct and nuanced in their personalities - so extending beyond Miles's altruism and Tristan's perfection. The romance felt predictable too. Parts of this book show potential, like some of the underlying themes and the author's imaginative magic system, so I have hope for more in future works.
