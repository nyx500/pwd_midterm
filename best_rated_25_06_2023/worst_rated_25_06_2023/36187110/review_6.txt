4.5 stars! In a fantasy version of Edwardian England, Miles Singer works as a doctor veteran’s hospital, hiding his magic while trying to heal his patients. When a murdered patient exposes his healing gift, Miles must work with a handsome stranger to find out who murdered this man and why.I had a hard time getting into this book at first, but after the first fifty pages this book flies. I loved falling into the worldbuilding and the mystery, CL Polk truly created a magical world. The characters were all great, if not developed as much as I like in my books. But that’s made up in the plot and pacing and again, the world building. This book is a commentary on slavery, independence, choice and freewill, and class privilege. I could see this book play out in my head like a tv series and I really hope it becomes one someday.
