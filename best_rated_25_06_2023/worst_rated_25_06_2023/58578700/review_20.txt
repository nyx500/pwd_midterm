I enjoyed this one a lot and can vouch for its awesomeness!If you liked my first book, Seraphina - particularly the politics, palace intrigue, and mystery - then I'd encourage you to give this one a try. Courtroom drama! Philosophy! Meditations on what it means to be a just ruler! To say nothing of the fact that Joan He really knows how to finesse a plot twist; I typically see these things coming a mile away, but she kept me guessing (and the final one just pulled the rug out from under me) and my hat's off to her. I see some reviews fussing a bit about character development, but I really liked what she did with these characters. They're understated and restrained in a consistent way that makes it feel like a coherent courtly culture, underpinned with specific philosophy. I thought that was very well done, in fact, even if they weren't acting quite the way we expect teens to act.
