Pro Tip: when you're casting narrators for an audiobook, they should be good at both female and male voices in all scenarios if that's what they'll be doing for the actual recording. The female narrator for this book used a Voldemort voice for the male character during sex scenes. It was hard to tell if the scenes were poorly written or if it was the narration that really Avada Kedavra'ed the mood, but I basically just skimmed the second half of the book and what was left was really meh. I probably won't bother with the rest of the series. I would recommend this book for people who empathize with Bellatrix Lestrange and would not recommend this audiobook for a road trip.
