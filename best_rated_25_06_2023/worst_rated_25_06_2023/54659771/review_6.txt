This is a Hades/Persephone retelling in a contemporary setting and it's just...super lackluster and boring. That and the only "retelling" about this is that their names are Hades and Persephone. Like, they could have easily have just been Todd and Cathy and the story would have been the exact same. I know the ~plot~ is not really the focal point here, but geez, I'm leaving this book with so many questions and I don't really care if I ever get the answers.
