Ok, so this book got a lot better in the last quarter. It's still a rambling self-indulgent mess of a novel that doesn't realize that it's supposed to have a plot except at the beginning and end.The main character, Billy Harrow curates an exhibit in the Natural History Museum that includes an 8 metre long giant squid. It goes missing. Then things get weird. Then weirder still. Eventually things get weird enough for this to be a China Mi√©ville book.Billy gets involved with several groups of people/creatures of occult London including a branch of the police that are as brutal, sadistic and uncaring as the bully-boy caricatures of the police force are made out to be. There's pure evil occult forces, determinedly neutral ones and even a few on Billy's side, most of whom are very memorable. Occult London clearly has some pretty bizarre politics and they seem balanced on a knife edge. There's a lot of similarities here with Neverwhere, and logically, Un Lun Dun. I much preferred both of those though.The central flaw here is that the plot makes no sense. I don't think it's supposed to. But at every stage I want to yell, "But, why?!" But I get the strong feeling that this is really just a handy framework to hang interesting ideas, fun situations and beautifully clever and very funny language.Not a favorite by any means.
