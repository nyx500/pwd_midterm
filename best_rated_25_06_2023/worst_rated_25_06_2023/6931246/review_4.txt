Kraken by China Mieville is about as predictable and formulaic as a book about a squid sect amidst a London underground teaming with competing cults and all under the shadow of the end of the world can be. Weird, weird book. But then, Mieville is supposed to be among the vanguard of the weird fiction group. I liked this, though it at times devolved into a clumsy absurdism; but to its credit, it never got down to ridiculous Kafkaesque or Beckettesque absurdity, but more of the Monty Python variety absurdism. There were many scenes that made me laugh out loud and I think I have seen some reviewers describe this as a dark comedy. Kraken also hosted a colorful satire on theology and organized religion. Absolutely a tribute to Lovecraft, this is a good book all by itself as well but maybe not the best as an introduction to his work. Newer readers might try Perdido Street Station first.Holding it all together is Mievilleâ€™s excellent writing, his unique imagination and his uncanny ability to draw from a multitude of inspirations from a calliope of genres and cultural mediums.
