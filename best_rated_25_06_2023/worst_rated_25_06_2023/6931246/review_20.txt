I really, really liked this book.This is the first China Mi√©ville book I've ever read, and it was a really great introduction to China's world. He clearly knows exactly what he's doing, I don't think that even one sentence was out of place. The writing style fits the theme of the book to a T: urban magic, modern takes on historical practices, like the haruspex.Speaking of these modern takes, I thought "Kraken" was VERY original. Almost everything in the book was something I wouldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams, from the religions that somehow all made sense, to the Egyptian familiar that has no body and can only go from one statue to the other to communicate, to the very literal Knucklehead thugs. I have realized that I really, really like the urban magic genre (probably because I can relate to it easier than, let's say, forest magic- I have no contact with forests), so this book was basically perfect for me.The characters were also interesting. As almost always, our protagonist, Billy, was just a little bland, probably so we could put ourselves in his shoes? It's fine though, he's still a good protagonist, and his booksmart skill make for a good duo with the ultra-tough Dane. My favourite was Collingswood, I liked her "Fuck everything" attitude, witchcraft and potty mouth, plus constant smoking (don't smoke though, kids)The only complaint I have is that the book is a tad too long, it could have been wrapped up earlier than it did. But hey, who am I to tell China what to do? Like I said before, I'm sure he knew what he was doing.
