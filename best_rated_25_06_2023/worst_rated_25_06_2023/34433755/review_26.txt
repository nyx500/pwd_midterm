This was a good YA fantasy book. I’m a huge fantasy fan so I was excited to read this. While the pace was a tiny bit up and down at times, enough went on to keep me on my toes and to keep reading. It looks like this is going to be a start of a series which I’m happy about.The world is split up in a three caste system with humans being the lowest and demons on top. Lei, is a human whose beauty gets her noticed and stuck in the position of being the demon kings concubine. While supposedly an honor it is not the life Lei wants. Will she do what is expected of her or find a way to rebel? First I do have to give a trigger warning. With what the main premise is about it should not be a surprise. There are attempted rape scenes and one actually rape scene. However, the rape scene is fade to black so it’s enough for you to know it happened but the details are not there. I’m not the biggest fan of spec-fic books where the characters are passive. Meaning everything always happens to them. While that does happen some in this book, Lei and the other main character Wren are both really strong of heart. I would not classify them as passive which I was really grateful for. I thought the romance was really sweet. It is a PG-13 romance but you feel the bond between them. In such a horrible world something so lovely and sweet shines through. The friendship and possibility of more were some of my favorite parts of the book. My one complaint was the epilogue. I did not care for it. I did an eye roll with an “oh come on” after it. I think there was plenty of material for a book 2 without that kind of epilogue. It didn’t ruin the book or anything; I just thought it was a tad gimmicky. If you are a YA fantasy fan, you will probably enjoy this book. It was a good read and I will be reading the next book for sure. An ARC was given to me for a honest review.
