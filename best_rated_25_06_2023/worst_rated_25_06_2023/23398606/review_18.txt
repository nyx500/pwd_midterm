I enjoyed this; I’m interested to see how Hatcher and Alice’s relationship plays out in the second book.The horror was not as much as you would think for this book but it definitely had gothic elements.But it was the most imaginative Alice in wonderland retelling I have ever read. Alice and Hatcher meet in an Asylum, with the Jabberwocky trapped with them. Each classic character comes into play in different ways - it’s a very interesting and modern take and one I really enjoyed.It was a creepy theme throughout and it was definitely mind bending, the Hatcher was amazing - and Alice did grow up at the end. Excited to read the finale in the duology.
