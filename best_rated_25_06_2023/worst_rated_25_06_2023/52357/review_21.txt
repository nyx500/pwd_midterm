A DANISH KING, A BRAVE HERO, TWO MONSTERS AND A DRAGON - IF THAT DOESN'T SPELL EPIC, I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES!✨ Popsugar Reading Challenge 2019✨ ✨✨A book set in Scandinavia✨✨Now. I might be biased here - I am Danish and most of this story takes place in Denmark - but this was truly an epos! I am not usually into poems, but this one actually moved me."[...] Beowulf and fear were strangers; he stood ready to dive into battle."THE GOOD STUFFWriting: It is not easy to make a battle sound almost beautiful, but the lyrical flow of the writing in this poem actually pulls it off. More than once I found myself rereading a stanza simply because the writing touched something in me. "In the darkness, the horrible shrieks of painAnd defeat, the tears torn out of Grendel'sTaut throat, hell's captive caught in the armsOf him who of all the men on earthWas the strongest."The epicness: There are so many things about this that makes it truly epic. The battles, the bloodshed, the heraldry, the monsters! Beowulf is a hero of the same ilk as Theseus, Hercules and Ragnarok."So fame comes to the men who mean to win it and care about nothing else."The mystery: This actually lies outside the actual story of the poem and is more about the history of the poem. Because there is so much mystery surrounding the origin of this story. The text was discovered in a monastery in the 16th century but was probably written around 700 AD by an unknown author in England, who somehow had knowledge of Danish and Swedish (Geat) legends and who tried to recast them in a Christian narrative. I might be the only one on this one, but this mystery really captivates me. Might just be because I am an historian...FOLLOW MY BLOG FOR MORE BOOK GOODNESS
