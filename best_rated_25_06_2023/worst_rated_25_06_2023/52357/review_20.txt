Like many readers, I first encountered Beowulf as a young student, then later as a college student. The writing seemed old and tired and, though the subject was adventurous, having to read to it in the context of an English lesson drained most of the life out of it.Seamus Heaney’s 2001 translation from the Old English breathes some new life into the ancient tale. We still have Grendel and his mom and later the dragon when our hero is an old king and not long for this world, but Heaney’s prose is colorful and vibrant. I was especially intrigued by the writing from the perspective of a Christian when it seemed plain that the tale being described was pre-Christian.This work also features an afterward by Heaney that goes into detail about how and why Beowulf is still important. It was also illuminating to learn that Tolkien was very much inspired by the older text, not sure that I knew that before, thanks Seamus!Good times!
