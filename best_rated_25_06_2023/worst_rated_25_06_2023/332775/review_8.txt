How many different forms of imprisonment are there? How irrevocable are they? What does living in that kind of prison do?I admire Incarceron for trying something that felt a bit new, and I generally enjoyed the story. I'm not sure I'd go back to reread it, though, so that's my personal line for a four-star book. But although this is a three-star review, it's worth checking out.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.
