Oh my gosh, I loved this book so much! Everything about this book was perfect to me. The writing was so amazing. I read Alex's other book, The Darkest Minds, last year so I had a pretty good idea of her writing style but I felt like Passenger was a million times better than The Darkest Minds. I thought the main characters, Etta and Nicholas, were so well written and beautiful. And I love that Nicholas is a person of color. That to me, is one of the biggest reasons I will recommend Passenger to everyone. Literature, especially the Young Adult genre, is so lacking in representation of people of color and Passenger is a step in the right direction. And I absolutely fell in love with Nicholas. He such an amazing character and I thought him and Etta made such a great team. I'm so insanely excited to see the growth and development of these two in the next book.I loved the concept of Passenger. I don't read a lot of books with time travel but Passenger is easily the best time travel book I've read. Overall, I really loved this book. Even though it's only January, I know Passenger is going to be one of my favorites from 2016. I enjoyed every aspect of this book and I can't wait for the next installment.
