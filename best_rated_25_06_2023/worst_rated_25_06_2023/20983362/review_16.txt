*I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review*Full Review: https://youtu.be/rm2jtr8q6LwWOW. An awesome book to start out the year! If you love time-traveling, definitely pick this up!Oceans, deserts, forests, London, France, New York City.. I wish every book could have these amazing settings. I really enjoyed the main character Etta and the fast pace of this book! The adventure she finds herself in was super fun and I just couldn't put this down!I'll have my full video review up in a couple of days!THAT ENDING. I'm happy that her mom was able to get away so quickly, but it was also somewhat irritating. That was the main hold that Cyrus had over Etta was her mother, yet really Etta shouldn't have worried... I guess it doesn't change that much really.Really upset by the news about Alice. Interested to hear why Rose thought it necessary? I was a little confused how Alice's death was linked to the mission of Etta being a clean slate traveler who would find and destroy the astrolabe. Who knows.I really enjoyed that we got to see from Etta's and occasionally Nicholas's POV. It made their relationship feel a bit more real to me. I loved them as partners!I'm super interested to see how Nicholas and Sophia work together in this next book. WHERE on earth Etta ended up (and Julian as well).
