I really enjoyed this book! I don't think I'm quite as blown away as most people, but it was really good.This book didn't really start to pick up until about 150 pages in for me, so just give it some time whenever you pick it up - it hooks you eventually.WORLD BUILDING AND TIME TRAVEL WERE GREAT. All of that was fantastic and interesting and unique and well done and I loved it.Overall I liked the characters, though the romance was a bit much sometimes. (insta-love anyone?) I equally loved and hated it. I really love Etta a lot.AND THAT'S HOW IT ENDS? Okay. I really need to know what happens next.Overall a great and fun read, but not BLOW ME AWAY THE BEST EVER AMAZING.
