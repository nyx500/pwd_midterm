4.5 stars!! I absolutely loved Passenger. It was a super exhilirating, heart-wrenching, wonderful story. It was completely different than a lot of books I normally read and extremely refreshing and unique! I love how Alex Bracken can write something so different from The Darkest Minds, which is an absolute favorite of mine, and yet do so well with it! Passenger just proves how much of a versatile, extraordinary writer she is. The world building was phenomenal as always, and I thought she wrote an extremely successful time travel novel. Full review to come on my YouTube channel on the release day!I received a free copy of this book from Disney Hyperion. I had no obligation to review this book and all opinions are my own.
