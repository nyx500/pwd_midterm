Bast you charming bastard.Patrick Rothfuss shares with us a day in the life of Bast, his character from his The Name of the Wind stories. Fans will recognize him as the Innkeeper’s (Kvothe’s) apprentice from the present day narrative. He’s also fae. And fun to watch as all get out.Published in the 2014 fantasy anthology “Rogues” (which has many good short stories) this provides a healthy look at one of Rothfuss’ more intriguing characters. The fairy elements reminded me vaguely of Susanna Clarke’s Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and was an entertaining novella.Merged review:This is a short story that was published as a part of the Rogues anthology in 2014 and then was later used as a part of the Fire & Blood history of the Targaryens.This documents the story of King Viserys’s brother Daemon and how he came to be a controversial leader in the Stepstones Islands.A good focus story on this colorful character, but I’m pretty sure sections of this (or maybe the whole thing) was lifted verbatim to be used in Fire & Blood.
