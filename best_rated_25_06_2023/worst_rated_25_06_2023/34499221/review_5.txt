I’m disappointed with how mediocre this was. It’s described as a dark and romantic story. It was dark at the beginning, then turned into mush. By the way our main characters were introduced, I was expecting some straight-up nastiness and bravado. False advertisement that was because that’s not the tone the story carried on with (but I didn’t mind this too much since there was some introspection our characters were going through). And the romance was...lacklustre. I mean, did it have to be there? It served no purpose. I felt nothing!I think the only aspect that I appreciated was the Prince and his crew, the bond and witty banter they shared. Plus the similarities Elian and Lira had in terms of them both wanting to desperately escape the shackles that had been forced on them. I wanted that angle of their character to be explored (it was too flimsy!) and wanted more brutality. The ending was annoyingly happy. It probably would’ve felt more satisfying had the initial plot point been carried out. I’m slightly getting over happy endings, particularly in fantasy. Or maybe this wasn’t just well done as it was too dramatic for my taste. It felt and read like the story was being crammed in. It wasn’t necessarily slow at any point. The plot was moving, however it seemed almost too calculated and each aspect of the story was placed accordingly. It didn’t flow, rather it felt too deliberate and purposely steered into a particular direction, i.e. getting the two main characters together. Pointless. There wasn’t enough time for me to grow attached to the characters and world, which is a shame, because it had so much potential. I think this would’ve worked better and read more fulfilling had it been a duology possibly, where then the writing, the characters, the world and plot would’ve been given their due right. I liked it enough though. Pre-review.This cost a quid. Naturally, I bought it. I miss me some good ol' fantasy. Book, you better deliver. You have standards to uphold now.LEGGO!! 🏃🏾‍♂️
