2.5⭐️This was one of my most anticipated reads of 2018 but for some reason I still went in with some doubts, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised -for the most part-.If I could sum this up in one word it’d be - fun. That’s it, it was a fun and engaging read that had its ups as well as downs. It would’ve also been a sold 4-star read had it not been for the unnecessary, far fetched romance that completely ruined the entire narrative for me. Starting off with what I liked:✨The sirens:Damn, I loved how dark and vile they were. I don’t like retellings and I also don’t like children’s books -Disney and whatnot-, they’re not the sort of books I grew up reading; I didn’t like them when I was a child myself and I certainly don’t like them now so I had a very restricted knowledge of the Little Mermaid story going in. Thus, for me this was refreshing. They were just deliciously dark and sinister which I had a joyous time reading. ✨How Lira and Elian started off:The other thing I loved was how unrelenting and ruthless both Lira and Elian were, at least at the beginning. They were both sharp-witted and set in their ways to accomplish whatever messed up goals they had: Lira, to kill and take the prince’s heart and Elian, to rid the world of sirens. At least, that was the case...😒- I also loved the banter and snark between all of the characters, not just Lira & Elian. It was as if they were incapable of having a straightforward conversation. Each comment was met with an equally snarky and snide comeback, and I was here for it. Now to the dreaded drawbacks, (had to be done).✨The unnecessary, unrealistic, unreasonable romance. That’s right. 🤦‍♀️I get it. This is YA and in YA, the term platonic does not exist. All roads have to lead back to a bloody romance! I’m sick of it.I just don’t get it; where, in what (stupid) rule book, does it say that two people who start off as strangers have to end up as lovers!? Why not end as comrades? As friends? Or even stay enemies while helping one another further their personal agenda? This could and would have been a fantastic book if it hadn’t been ruined by their sudden newfound “love” for each other. All that ruthlessness, from both characters, that I was so attracted to instantly dissipated the moment they started getting all weak and sappy (I am, by no means, saying romance makes you weak but some semblance of believability makes all the difference).I was promised a ruthless siren and relentless prince on a murdering rampage - obviously, not the case here at all. ✨Lira’s change of heart: This’s a continuation to what I’ve just said above but for whatever reason, I found her change of heart even more irksome than I did Elian’s. She’s born a siren. Raised as a siren and was only a human for, what, just a few days? So, what, that’s all it takes to change one’s nature? Just a few days for her to suddenly forget everything she’s known, her very nature as a siren and grow human emotions? Again, I’m not saying these are bad, not for a human. But not in this particular situation, with a siren. ✨Elian’s crusade: This, I had the biggest problem with. I had such a hard time believing his crusade as the saviour of humanity, as “the deadly siren hunter”. Here’s the thing, yes, sirens are deadly in this world BUT not exactly deadly enough to have all the neighbouring kingdoms come together and “fight the big fight” because unless you invade their space which obviously is the seas, they pretty much can’t do anything to you or your land. Even his father, the king, doesn’t really take Elian’s crusade as seriously and only considers it a sort of, ‘get this adventure out of your system before you take the throne’ kind of a thing. So, for me it felt almost like a child’s play. There was just no urgency to it. It wasn’t like the world was going to cease to exist if Elian didn’t “stop the sirens”. Aside from these tiny issues, great, great read. Really. 👍
