— DNF @32% —I blame my small tolerance for slow paced books. I literally can probably only enjoy 1 short paced book out of 10. Even then I need characters that intrigue me to keep me going and they were not doing it for me here.The way I would describe the vibe of this book is The Diviners but make it about vampires rather than ghosts. I didn't even reach the part wherein the vampires were explicitly mentioned... I guess. But that never was a selling point to me so I didn't care much for it. And even though The Diviners is probably just as slow paced at this one, I didn't feel the slow pacing because I was too immersed with the character relationships.The european setting (especially when they are all specifically in france) gets old easily. Don’t get me wrong, I love the setting. It's probably just because I just read a fantasy set in france and I wasn't in the mood for that.It's a (very) slow paced story. Nothing was happening up until the part that I read. The voices of the characters felt like something that I have read a hundred times and nothing felt particularly unique to me.It does have: historical fiction with supernatural elements, diverse cast, and mystery. So if you are into those, you can give this a shot :3I don't have strong opinions, I'm just... meh. Which hurts because I was looking forward to this and I felt like I was getting dragged along. “But if a monster takes a life, what kind of creature refuses to save one?”
