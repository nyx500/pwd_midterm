2**This book was so meh. I was excited to delve in again and read about blood sucking vampires... and instead it just sucked out all the enjoyment from a book.The first half of this was probably a 3- I loved the allure and details of New Orleans and the possibilities of the supernatural. ... But that was it. Other than the setting of New Orleans everything else fell flat for me: there were too heavy/many descriptions of what the MC was wearing, not enough detail on the mysterious groups of people, a MC constantly obsessing over power and an instant love that didn’t make any sense. All of the characters in this were pretty one dimensional which probably adds to the issues I had with the instant love- as the romance was so rushed and seemed to come out of nowhere. The plot at the end of the book I found was wrapped up too quickly and a “surprising reveal” just had me rolling my eyes. I found this book focused too heavily on the MC and the no-sense attraction to a rather dull character, rather than the vampires and murder which drew me to this book originally.Another issue is that if you do not know french / Italian this book maybe hard to understand. There were many sentences dotted around in these languages, where I would’ve found it helpful to have some form of footnote to understand the translation.Overall I just didn’t enjoy this book.
