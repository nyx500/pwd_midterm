This was actually incredible I’m speechless, I just finished less than 5 minutes ago and I’m trying to collect myself...I’m just wowI honestly knew from the first chapter of this book that it would be something I just adored and I was soooo right. I kept putting off reading it because I wanted to stay in the world as long as I could, if I didn’t stop myself I would have finished this entire book on the first day easily. This is the first book I’ve read from Ahdieh and holy hell her writing style is absolutely glorious, so magical so descriptive I’m in awe. I loooooved the used of first and third person, between the main chapters and the almost monologued other chapters, it was such a unique way to get into the ~villain~’s head. Soooo well done!Celine was such an amazing character, her strength, her passion, her fearlessness. She was so amazing, I loved her back story and how she fought all through the book I love her so much. And Bastien??? He’s so dreamy ugh! I just wow I don’t even know what to say the story evolved so much and I’m just in love with every page...AND THAT PLOT TWIST ?? AND CLIFFHANGER EPILOGUE THOUGH ??? I AM DEADI HAVE BOOK 2 ON PREORDER AND I AM SO EXCITED FOR ITS RELEASE!!
