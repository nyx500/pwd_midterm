So, in the increasing hysteria mounting over the advent of the final Harry Potter book, I have been reading anything I can get my hands on before we all know how it ends and the fun is over! This teeny little book is quite funny and reads in about 10 minutes. Written exclusively for charity, it includes a libary check-out card in the front with "H. Potter" on the final line, as well as an explanatory foreward by Dumbledore himself. Utterly charming, it is more evidence that Rowling's universe is systematically and meticulously plotted out to the last detail, including the similarities between the golden snitch and the now endangered bird, the Golden Snidget!
