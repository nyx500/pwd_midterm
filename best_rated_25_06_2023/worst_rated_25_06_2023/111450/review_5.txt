I think that Rita said it very well: "I've read worse.". It was a fun, quick read but... A bit dull if you ask me. There was a lot of effort to make it funny, but it just felt a bit forced. But I have to admire JK that she put so much thought into the whole universe and has so much knowledge about it. That's fantastic! But I believe that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them where just a bit better.
