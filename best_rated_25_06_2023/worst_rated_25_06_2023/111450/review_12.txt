‘I’ve read worse.’ – Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet And I was like SHUT UP, you old douche-bag! Also, that object of a thief’s curse is amusing.So, let’s dive into the Quidditch Guide! I usually don’t indulge myself much in sports section but Quidditch has always been alluring one!The originality of game – initially known as  “Kwidditch” is quite peculiarly appealing. The traces of those borrowed from a witch’s diary are a really fun part, actually the way she described the game. But the all the bladder business of dragons, goats used in the game is really creepy. The Anti-Muggle precautions are bizarre, and types of fouls totally hilarious. I expected it to drag or bore me but it never wavered my attention for a single second. The continents wise categorization along with the team descriptions is, in fact, detailed one but I demand more illustrations. The Snitch which was at first used as a Live bird – Snidget! Later on, The Ministry of Magic banned its use in the game replacing it with charmed Snitch.  And all of the sudden nostalgia hits you while relishing the pages – The first game of Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Fred and George Weasley (*actually almost the whole Weasley Family, even Ginny played it) and all that cheering for the house – Gryffindor! And of course how can I forget the World Cup:  P.S.:  And before Ginny says – SHUT IT! Go and read it.
