This is a detailed summary of key features of the book. I’ve hidden big spoilers, but there may be minor ones, depending on your definition of “spoiler”.I have a  briefer, spoiler-free, and very different, review here (different * rating, too): https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..., which is more about my feelings for the book. It also includes a selection of favourite quotes and links to interviews. The difference in star rating is deliberate: I couldn't decide.LINKS AND THEMESThis book, perhaps more than any of his others, cannot be viewed in isolation. In particular, it is closely tied to The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I’ve read all Mitchell’s previous books (four of them twice): connectedness is the most overarching theme, within and between books.All (except Black Swan Green?) muse on (im)mortality, specifically souls moving from one body to another, but not in a spooky paranormal way; it’s more matter-of-fact than that. The sometimes uneasy host/guest/invader relationship is mirrored in wider themes about power, exploitation and survival of the fittest. Music often features, as do islands, rescue vessels (literal and metaphorical), and survival despite societal collapse. Here, there is no sudden, total apocalypse and it happens without a glittering high-tech future in between. Most famously, characters from one book make fleeting appearances in another. This is fun, pretentious, sometimes gratuitous, distracting, but enriching. I like the idea that just as his novels (including this) are often built up of connected stories in different styles, those novels have a similar relationship to each other: stories within stories within stories, creating a whole world of connections: immortality by transferring from one vessel to another. “Each of my novels are expanders or chapters in a kind of uber-book, a piece of a universe that all my novels are making”. That makes it less surprising that his next five novels are “planned to some degree”. One will be the final volume of the Marinus trilogy.The Thousand Autumns had seemed to be a fairly conventional historical novel with fewer connections than Ghostwritten and Cloud Atlas; The Bone Clocks changes that, exposing overlaps and hidden fantasy:•	Slade House (reviewed here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) is entirely in this world.•	Marinus, a significant character in The Thousand Autumns, is a major character in this.•	Marinus mentions Arie Grote from his life in Dejima in Thousand Autumns. •	The immortality-seeking baby-eating cult in Thousand Autumns is presumably an early grouping of Anchorites.•	We glimpse Prescience, precursors of the Prescients from Cloud Atlas. •	Hugo Lamb’s cousin is Jason Taylor, the main character in Black Swan Green (who was in turn, heavily based on Mitchell).•	Ed Brubeck writes for Spyglass magazine, as did Luisa Rey in Cloud Atlas.•	Elijah D’Arnoq is a reincarnation or descendant of a D’Arnoq that Adam Ewing encounters in The Chatham Islands in Cloud Atlas.•	Dwight Silverwind from Ghostwritten makes a small but significant appearance.•	Mo Muntervary has small important roles here and in Ghostwritten.•	There is a mention of a battle in a sunken garden, the title of the opera Mitchell recently wrote the libretto for.•	Holly’s family get takeaways from The Thousand Autumns Restaurant (though it’s Chinese, not Japanese).•	Soleil Moore: she’s an Asian-American poet who is really important, then drops out of the narrative completely. I’m guessing she’ll feature prominently in a future book. There are also characters apparently based on real characters: Lord Roger Brittan is a minor character, rather like Lord (Alan) Sugar; more obviously, Crispin Hershey is remarkably like Martin Amis (see below).The book even references itself: Hershey bases one of his characters on Holly’s husband, and Soleil Moore accuses him of having written about Anchorites.CASTThere is an enormous cast, and some characters live in multiple bodies and so go by different names. Those peripheral in one section are often significant in later one.I don’t need to like the protagonists of a book, which is just as well. Holly isn’t unlikeable, but I found her voice annoying and trying too hard to sound teenage, yet not always believable. (In particular, endless abbreviations: “Ed Brubeck’ll be”, “Mam will’ve told Dad… ‘bout why”, and the apostrophe-esses that weren’t possessive were easy to stumble over). Other characters are highly unpleasant, yet somehow lacking the glamour of a really good baddie.Many have accents in their names, which was a little distracting: Zoe, Anais, Eilish, Oshima, Immaculee – but not Aoife.Hershey, Amis, Mitchell?Critics have seen close parallels between Martin Amis and former “Wild Child of British Letters”, Crispin Hershey: in terms of life events, writing style, personality, and book titles (Hershey’s successful Desiccated Embryos and another called Red Monkey compared with Amis’ Dead Babies and Yellow Dog). Martin's father, Kingsley, is even quoted, saying a bad review might spoil breakfast, but he wouldn’t let it spoil lunch.Mitchell has repeatedly denied any conscious link. Instead, he claims Hershey is “not just my worst aspect, he’s my fears. He’s what I might turn into if I’m not careful” and he "is all the worst parts of me, amplified and smooshed together" and in this section "I got to have a lot of fun spoofing people like me". Hershey’s most successful novel has a symmetrical structure, like Cloud Atlas.Most literary critics are sceptical. The Guardian wondered whether “buried deep within this scrupulously polite and unassuming writer, a revenge fantasist [is] just waiting to punish the reviewers who dismiss him” or if he’d “belatedly woken up to the fact that taking a pop at his literary elders is not necessarily the smartest career move”.I’ve only read one Amis novel, and nothing else by him; I wonder if he has Crispin’s quirk of alternating between first and third person for himself – even in a single sentence!META – MUSINGS ON WRITINGMitchell sees each collection of related novellas as part of a greater work: echoes and foreshadowing abound, Hershey’s failed book has “Echo” in the title, and elsewhere, we’re told the mysterious “Script” “loves to foreshadow”. In this, he explicitly muses on fiction, writing, and lit crit, and pre-empts some potential criticisms of this book. The bad review that kill Hershey's sales, includes, “Hershey is so bent on avoiding cliché that each sentence is as tortured as an American whistleblower… The fantasy sub-plot clashes so violently with the book’s State of the World pretentions, I cannot bear to look… What surer sign is there that the creative aquifers are dry than a writer creating a writer-character?” Later, “A book can’t be a half fantasy any more than a woman can be half pregnant.” After the second deus ex machina moment, Mitchell has one of the characters declare it as such, just so you know he knows. In some ways, Hershey is very unlike Mitchell, observing that “in publishing, it’s easier to change your body than it is to switch genre” – something Mitchell makes a speciality of. He also makes prescriptive judgements on writing that I doubt Mitchell subscribes to in blanket terms: “Double-negatives are truth smugglers” and “Adverbs are cholesterol in the veins of prose”.“A writer flirts with schizophrenia, nurtures synaesthesia and embraces obsessive-compulsive disorder. Your art feeds on you, your soul and, yes, to a degree, your sanity. Writing novels worth reading will bugger up your mind, jeopardise your relationships and distend your life.”At one point, Hugo observes, “such narrative arcs make great movies, but shitty lives”; he neglects to say what sort of books they make. PLOTThis is deceptively straightforward for Mitchell: a chronological story of one woman’s life, told in six, first-person parts:1984 “A Hot Spell”Illustrated with a disintegrating clock, narrated by Holly, a fifteen-year old who heard voices as a child, and now runs away after bust ups with parents and boyfriend. It is not Orwellian.From aged 7, Holly occasionally heard voices she called “The Radio People” – “not a ghost… but a visitor to your mind”. One night, one of them (Miss Constantin) appeared in her room, and afterwards, a bully Holly mentioned is hit by a van! Shortly after that, a psychiatrist (Dr Marinus) gets rid of the voices. Now, aged 15, after a row with her parents, she runs away to be with her boyfriend. Just before she goes, her brilliant but weird younger brother, Jacko, gives her a labyrinth he’s drawn and stresses the importance of her memorising it. She finds boyfriend Vinny in bed with best friend Stella, so heads off on her own. She meets a strange old woman who knows her name and says she may ask for asylum. She thinks she glimpses Jacko in an underpass, but it can’t possibly be him and then it turns into a more muddled multi-sensory hallucination. Later, she’s staying with a couple who are suddenly dead, apparently by the power (or maybe just poison) of a strange and sinister visitor who rambles about all sorts of stuff neither she nor the reader understand. There is a bizarre, rather filmic fight, but she escapes and has her memory of it wiped. How is she narrating what was wiped? And a few pages later, she muses, “When you know your memory’s been monkeyed around with once, how can you ever be sure of any memory again?”. She heads for a fruit farm and dreams she is pregnant (we later discover she was, and had an abortion). Ed Brubeck turns up and tells her Jacko is missing.1991 “Myrrh is Mine, Its Bitter Perfume”Illustrated with Holly’s labyrinth, told by Hugo Lamb, a conscience-free, money-loving Cambridge student, not quite as aristo as his equally obnoxious friends. Far more important than it first seems. Hugo loves music (shades of Alex in Clockwork Orange, for more reasons than that: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), and in a crucial scene, he’s approached by beautiful Immacule Constantin, who asks him about power. He gives a pompous student answer. Her reply includes “Power is lost or won, never created or destroyed… Power is crack cocaine for your ego and battery acid for your soul… Power’s comings and goings from host to host… are the plot of history… Power itself is amoral… Power is watching you.” She offers him “perpetual deferral of death”, but doesn’t explain, and next thing he knows, it’s an hour later and she’s gone. Reading to an old family friend with Alzheimer’s, exposes Hugo’s fears (“Whatever I do with my life… I, too, will end up like this vile old man… I’m looking down time’s telescope at myself”). A train ride prompts other musings, “’I am the system you have to beat’ clacks the carriage… Another train on a parallel track… glimpse the young City worker I’ll have turned into this time next year… but his train sways away down a different track.” Hugo is a nasty piece of work: apart from fleecing old Brigadier Philby of his valuable stamps, he sets up a friend(!) to lose heavily in a card game so that the friend will be forced to sell a vintage car that Hugo will take a cut of, and when the victim drives it over a cliff, Hugo’s only thought is “I could weep. All that money.” He’s never been in love and realises “Nothing throws the chasm between me and Normals into starker relief than grief and bereavement.” He meets Holly in a Swiss ski resort, where she’s a barmaid, and although she seems immune to his charms, they have a fling and he (maybe) falls in love. Elijah D’Arnoq, who tried to recruit him to a student shooting club called the Anchorites wants him to take a leap of faith to find out what it’s all about. Hugo realises he’s being offered a Faustian pact and that “tends not to have a happy ending”.2004 “The Wedding Bash”Illustrated with a crystal ball showing the Middle East, told by Ed Brubeck. Two very contrasting aspects: the excitement of a family wedding and life (and constant risk of death) as a reporter in Iraq. Ed is back from reporting in Iraq for Holly’s sister’s wedding; he sees himself as “an archivist for the future”, which is one way of assuaging the guilt of being away so much: “Aoife’s childhood is a book. I’m flicking through instead of reading properly”. When he’s out with Aoife, Immacule turns up, saying she’s a friend of Holly’s and checks the six year old for an “invisible eye”. Aoife wants to go to the fortune teller (Dwight Silverwind), but Ed refuses. Great Aunt Eilish describes Jacko (who was never found) as a changeling: he was ordinary until he caught meningitis aged five. Eighteen months later, he was different and knew too much for his age, but “It wasn’t Jacko’s brain that changed… it was his soul.” He even told her he was “a well-intentioned visitor”. She had to tell Ed this because it’s in the Script, and he should “Believe her [Holly], even if you don’t believe in it”. Ed and Aoife have a nap and when he wakes, she’s gone. He assumes she’s gone to Dwight; she hasn’t, but he helps look for her, telling Ed “I’m scripted to stay with you until the end”. Holly faints, says “ten fifteen” and drops her labyrinth pendant; Dwight realises it means room 1015, which is where she is. It’s as if Holly was one of the Radio People. 2015 “Crispin Hershey’s Lonely Planet”Illustrated with a spider and web, told by Crispin, an amoral, formerly successful, novelist.See notes about Amis, and Meta, above. Hershey was the “Wild Child of British Letters”, having had a very successful book (Desiccated Embryos) but a later one (Echo Must Die ) savagely reviewed by a uni friend of Hugo’s called Richard Cheeseman. Hershey blames Cheeseman for ruining his career. He takes revenge. The repercussions are far worse than expected, but he’s not overburdened with guilt, seeing Cheeseman as a thief, he “committed the action. I am the reaction.” Meanwhile, widowed Holly has written a bestselling memoir called “The Radio People”, and they keep running into each other at book festivals around the world. He hates all the psychobabble, but, they form a friendship. Although Holly no longer hears The Radio People, she does get occasional premonitions, ���I’d be mugged by a bunch of facts that hadn’t happened yet” and she has a specific recurring vision related to him, of “a spider, a spiral and a one-eyed man”. All three feature, loosely, in his sudden death at the hands of Soleil Moore, who thinks that killing him is the only way to make the world read her poems (that he had not) and so learn about the Anchorites.2025 “An Horologist’s Labyrinth”Illustrated with an apple, narrated by Marinus. It becomes full-on YA fantasy here. It reminded me of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials. If I’d read any Dan Brown, I might spot parallels there.Plotwise, it could have ended at the end of this, but my rating would have been lower, as I found this section increasingly silly.This is where the bulk of the strange vocab occurs (see below). There is much backstory of Marinus (in his 36th body), and especially the long-standing war between Horologists (good) and Anchorites (bad). Repeated lives, coupled with premonitions is almost like time travel (people sending messages to their future selves via complex routes, for instance), people swap body/sex//country/name, and there’s plenty of crossing and double-crossing. Anchorites are predators: they kill engifted children at regular intervals to maintain immortality and after that, they don’t age and can... teleport! “They are addicts and their drug is artificial longevity.” Horologists are “born” as such, and when one body dies, they pass harmlessly to another random body, sometimes sharing a body with another soul. The Horologists have a complicated plan to destroy the Anchorites (a previous one failed): multiple body swaps, life and death, fighting, transporting, borderline magic… exciting, or just silly? It was the latter for me: the incantations sounded like Harry Potter spells, someone is bludgeoned with a rolling pin, and the writing goes crazy, “hidden by a Deep Stream cloak… got to you with a quantum totem” and “a crack in the fabric of the Chapel of the Dusk” – bring me Lyra’s Subtle Knife and be done! Anchorites see things rather differently: “Horology is a club for immortals who prevent others from attaining their own privileges”, which conveniently overlooks all the killing. The end of this chapter was a foregone conclusion for me, albeit not in the details, with a deus ex machina. 2048 “Sheep’s Head”Illustrated with a running fox silhouetted against an ominously large moon, told by Holly, who is old, and struggling to raise two children, as a slow-burn apocalypse approaches. There is irony the fact this increasingly desperate situation is utterly plausible and grounded in current and possible events. The fantasy battles of the previous chapter seems irrelevant – especially as connectedness is the most fundamental thing to collapse (“the commodity we’re most in need of is news”).Holly has survived cancer, but is old, living in rural Ireland, raising Aoife’s daughter and a young boy refugee. It is The Endarkment: global power shortages, barely any internet, rising sea levels, food (and everything else) is rationed, a nuclear power station is leaking, gangs roam, and the Chinese dominate the economy (mail order brides now go from Europe to the East) and have concession in Ireland. The prognosis is decline, “For most of my life, the world shrank and technology progressed” but she now realises that “’the natural order of things’ is entirely man-made.” She lives in an area protected by government forces, but is all too aware that as life gets harder, that may not be sustainable: “Civilization’s like the economy… if people stop believing it’s real, it dies”. Painfully real, basic survival is in sharp contrast to the preceding section. There’s another deus ex - and this time the characters themselves recognise it as such (another pre-emptive strike by Mitchell). In its defence, it does tie up with Cloud Atlas.VOCABThe vocab list for anyone interested in horology became somewhat ludicrous. Here’s a sample:Scansion, Incorporeals, Atemporals, Sojourners (go straight from one body to another, usually of the same sex), Returnee (“each resurrection is a lottery of longitudes, latitudes and demography”, usually alternating gender, with a 49 day gap), subtalk, the Script, Aperture, Shaded Way, psychovoltaic, “hiatus freezes [someone], suasion forces [them]”, oubliette, psychosoterica, carnivorous psycho-decanter, animacides, soul thieves, chakra-latent, dreamseed, metalife, transversing.CLOSING THOUGHTS“For one voyage to begin, another voyage must come to an end, sort of.” I think that sums up Mitchell’s approach to his novels. Mitchell quotes mostly from http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/p...), and http://www.theguardian.com/books/book.... Also interviews on BBC Radio 2’s Book Club, and Radio 4’s Front Row (that I can’t find online any more).All my Mitchell reviews are on this uber shelf:https://www.goodreads.com/review/list...
