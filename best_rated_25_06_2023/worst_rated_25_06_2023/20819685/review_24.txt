'We sort of live on, as long as there are people to live on in.'This had all the David Mitchell trademarks that I love so much. It tells of a hidden war taking place through time by two different ' immortal with terms and conditions' groups. I don't want to say any more really about the plot as part of the joy of a David Mitchell novel is actually working out what is going on and how it all relates.The story is told through the viewpoint of several characters, each one at a jump of a few years. They intertwine and weave together as we go along but Holly is the main character and has a part in all of the stories.This book came out a few years ago now and I had been planning to read it on its release. However, the novel didn't seem to be too well received. As a fan of David Mitchell, I didn't want to be disappointed, but finally I picked it up. It ticked all the boxes for me. It covers so much ground I don't even know how to shelve it- a little dystopia, fantasy, psychosoteric..plus a dash of history- all my favourites!Recommended.
