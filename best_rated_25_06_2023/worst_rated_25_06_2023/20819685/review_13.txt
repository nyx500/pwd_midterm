I couldn't finish this book, I struggled to even get to 300 pages, it's horribly boring.The opening chapter is fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed Holly's perspective but things really go downhill after that.The book follows Holly Sykes' life through other people who meet her as she ages.Holly Sykes has a strange connection with an outside influence which is a mystery to her and the reader.After Holly's opening chapter, the narrative switches to Hugo who was an absolute pain to read,it's depressingly boring and his chapter seems to be completely pointless.Perhaps at the end it ties together but Holly makes a small appearance and we learn nothing new about her, other than where she is working and the fact she's now older.The next chapter follows Holly's husband, Ed and his narrative is actually quite interesting and I did enjoy it.His chapter actually gave me insight into Holly's strange abilities and added to my understanding.I gave up reading a bit into Crispin Hersheyâ€™s narrative as I was falling asleep while reading it and I just couldn't read any further.This novel definitely wasn't for me although I did enjoy two chapters but I couldn't force myself to go further.Some of my friends love this book but Bone Clocksis just not for me.
