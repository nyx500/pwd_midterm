It is a novel that covers six periods by five narrators. It is a breathtaking chronicle of Margaret Mitchell's "Gone Brings the Wind" or Tolstoy's "War and Peace" related to the confused and unheroic period of the times in which we live.David Mitchell invites us to a reflection, a meditation on our globalized Western civilization through a woman's life from 1984 to 2043 and the events she goes through in 1984, 1991, 2004,2015, 2025 and 2043.The plot rendered each period in its colour by choosing the right narrator and style, which causes the brutality of final awareness in 2043 and makes this terrible future plausible.A novel to read and let rest in the depths of our soul as a deep mediation.
