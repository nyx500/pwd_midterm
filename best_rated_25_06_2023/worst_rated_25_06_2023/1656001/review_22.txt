Finally read this for the first time and it was so refreshing after I read Twilight, as I enjoyed this book so much more. It definitely still has problematic parts and isn’t perfect, but I enjoyed it. Wanda and Ian’s relationship was so adorable and one of the reasons I liked this book so much! I also did a full video review and commentary to me reading this book, which you can check out here: https://youtu.be/kdlnJ1PlzFo
