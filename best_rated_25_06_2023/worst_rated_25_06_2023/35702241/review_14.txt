beyond the sex positivity & surface level female empowerment this was just... meh. i mean don't get me wrong i appreciated the aforementioned feminism but this story was just. odd.i get that it was trying to be a standalone fantasy but it seemed like there was so much here that wasn't explored. i mean the man is called the Shadow King and yet we never get more than a passing understanding of what that means. and the plot was... um. lacking. i dunno i felt uneasy the whole time while reading this (except when they consummated their relationship, that was nice). i was just constantly waiting for the "more" to show up and it never did.anyway, more thoughts to come in video form.
