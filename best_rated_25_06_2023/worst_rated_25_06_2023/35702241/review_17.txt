We need more Slytherin narrators in the world.I’ve always found myself drawn to characters with Slytherin traits. They’re much more interesting than your purely good characters (sorry, Jon Snow). This book’s narrator, Alessandra, is a rare one. Legitimately. I’ve NEVER seen a narrator like this who wasn’t the villain. She’s confident. She’s unapologetic. She’s cunning. She’s observant. She’s direct. I didn’t spend one second of this book internally screaming, “COME ON. JUST ASK HIM WHAT HE REALLY MEANS. JUST TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL. ASK HIM TO CLARIFY” because homegirl Alessandra just goes for it. She’s well aware she’s not an angel and never pretends otherwise. Mad respect.She legit tells you on page 1 that she killed someone when she was 15. Is she sorry? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Again, mad respect.She doesn’t need protecting. She doesn’t need saving. Just get the fuck out of her way because she’s got this.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻The only thing I’m mad about in regards to this book is I spent the entire time reading thinking it was the first book in a series and I would get to spend more time with these characters. But noooooooo. I just had to be illiterate and/or misremember. What a moron.One final note—I fully support the pro-women, anti-slut shaming stance this book takes. It absolute annihilates that whole idea that “beautiful virgin female MC” is the only way to go. Because, get the smelling salts, Alessandra sleeps with men FOR FUN. BECAUSE SHE LIKES IT. She doesn’t have feelings for them. She just likes to bang. AND THAT’S OKAY. 💕 Her friend in the book IS a beautiful virgin and IS waiting until marriage—AND THAT IS ALSO OKAY! 💕 Just look:“I’m not a trollop...I’m a sexually empowered woman, and there is nothing wrong with that.” YAAAASSSSSSSS!AND THEN:“There is nothing silly about waiting until you want to. Don’t let anyone ever tell you otherwise. It is your body to do with as you will... Waiting. Not waiting. One lover. A hundred lovers. There should be no judgment either way. A woman is not defined by what she does or doesn’t do in the bedroom.”I legit thought my heart was going to burst and I was just going to die right there in my sweatpants-and-Christmas-sweatshirt-quarantine-look because THANK. YOU. STOP THE SLUT SHAMING.STOP THE SLYTHERIN SHAMING.And goddammit, if you don’t know what a Slytherin is, please go read Harry Potter.Otherwise I, a Gryffindor, will have to charge after you and beat you over the head with it (Gryffindors are not subtle) (see: this entire review).
