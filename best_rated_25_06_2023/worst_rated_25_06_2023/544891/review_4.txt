i have to trust that i read this book, because goodreads says i did, which means that past me says i did.but i do not have even one memory of it. apparently, six-years-ago-me thought it was a three star read. that's all i've got for all of us. part of a series i'm doing in which i review books i read a long time ago, mostly to ensure i never have to think about them again
