I liked this way better than I thought I would going in. I am always leery of Number 1 of 20 in a series. Do I want to start something like that? Yet, I really enjoyed this slow developing story of a young man in search of himself. A Magic System that is slowly revealed, as the main character learns more about what can and can not be done. Nice logic to the magic system, also nice that the magic has grey edges.Can work as a stand alone, but I am all set to go on to book two. A Nice Old School fantasy.
