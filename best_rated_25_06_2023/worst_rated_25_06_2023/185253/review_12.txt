I first read this over 25 years ago & it hooked me on the Recluce series. It's the first published, but 17th in the chronology (C17, P01). It was a real journey of discovery that first time as Modesitt built the complicated world through Lerris' eyes, a young, disaffected man who was ignorant of so much. My one real issue with the book is how much he suddenly understood toward the end. I guess he's a lot smarter than I am.My favorite parts were the woodworking & the horse (large pony). I'm a woodworker &, if it isn't obvious from my profile picture, ride a large pony of my own & even use a hackamore on him. Both require a lot of work that is generally ignored by authors. There were some obvious oversights in both, but Modesitt does a far better job than most & at least he tried hard.IMO, this book reads a lot better in chronological order than published order. The whole series does. For a list of the current chronology of this series, see my review here:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
