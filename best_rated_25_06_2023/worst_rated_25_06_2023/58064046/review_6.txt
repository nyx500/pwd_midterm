literally how did this win GR choice awards in YA fantasy with all the other amazing books on there??? make it make sense________________Well that was pretty bad.I think I'm just going to stick with Schwab's more fantasy focused books because this??? This was not it.There was no plot whatsoever (until like over halfway), but in general I don't even care 99% if there isn't one as long as I'm invested in the characters. Which wasn't the case at all here."Safe does not mean happy, does not mean well, does not mean kind."For so long, Olivia has longed to be wanted, especially in a place like Merilance... until one day she receives a note from her uncle, Arthur Prior, about coming to live in Gallant--a mysterious, large estate. However, once she gets there Olivia realizes Gallant is not all what it seems to be and there was a reason her mother warned her away from it...And then goes the page descriptions of the house for almost 200 pages yay! Honestly who doesnt love reading about how a house looks like?? If you don't, you clearly have no taste.In all seriousness, if you asked me what happened in this book I couldn't tell you. It literally feels like nothing happened at all the first half. I almost fell ASLEEP reading it and that never happens to me?? Never in my life have I ever almost fallen asleep reading a book. Gallant is the first to ever do this to me.Just why.Why did it take until the 60% mark for the villain to appear and something to happen LIKE WHATðŸ’€ There was so little page time of the *villain* so of course I didnt feel spooked or rather anything towards them. This book really is the definition of pretty writing, bland story. Like sure the writing was very descriptive and fancy but??? I was bored out of mind?? I could care less about the characters, story, plot (haha what plot) and everything else. I don't care if you have the most beautiful writing in the world. If the story doesn't capture my attention, then I don't like it.I genuinely do not see the point of this book and I've never said this about any book before but really do not see it here.I will say though that it was very interesting to have a main character who couldnt speak! This is my first book seeing that and it was pretty interesting. I also saw some similarities between this book and Coraline so maybe some may love that a lot.Other than that, nothing about Gallant appealed to me. It's considered horror but??? What horror, there was literally nothing spooky about this. Gallant felt like it was written by a completely different person but maybe it's because of the shift in genre of Schwab going more for horror than fantasy so it felt different?? I don't know but I literally adored Schwab's Shades of Magic series and Addie Larue so I was really hoping to love this too. Instead, I was dying of boredom.Nothing hurts more than having one of your most anticipated reads by your favourite author be a disappointment. This is probably a just me thing, so to anyone reading this don't let my review deter you from reading this! i have many super unpopular opinions soooThank you so much Harper Collins Canada for sending me an ARC in exchange for an honest review!!________*sobs in disappointment*RTC________ive loved every schwab book ive read so far so if i dont love this one-
