★★ /5This was fine… I guess?!?I defiantly see the appeal of this book, the premise is interesting, but execution let me down. I as a lot of people had seen the movie based on this book, so I had some sort of understanding of what should happen in this book, but sadly my hopes didn’t come true. Sadly, this book was really boring and full of filler content, literally, you can skip 70 percent of this book and you will not miss anything. The structure of this book was all over the place, and even the climax of the story wasn’t rewarding at all. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the writing style, it’s one of the reasons why I kept reading it. In addition, I liked the characters, I found their relationships pretty interesting.
