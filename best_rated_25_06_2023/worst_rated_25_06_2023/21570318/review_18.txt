(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to HarperCollins and Edelweiss.)“This story begins with endless night and infinite forest; with two orphaned children, and two swords made of broken bone. It has not ended yet.”This was an okay YA fantasy story, but I did lose patience towards the end.Rachelle was a girl who didn’t give up what she was trying to achieve no matter the consequences. She knew that it would be tough to find one of the hidden swords that were needed to destroy the forestbound, but she never gave up hope that she would manage it, no matter how bad things got.“All she had to do was solve the riddle and find the sword.”The storyline in this was about Rachelle trying to find one of the swords to kill off the bad guys, as well as accidentally gaining a job as a body guard. I did find it extremely difficult to see how this story was anything like Red Riding Hood at all though. The only thing that this book had that was anything like little Red Riding Hood was the girl in a red cape on the cover. “One day soon he will open his eyes and yawn, and then he will swallow up the moon and the sun, and we shall live in darkness once again.”That being said, the story didn’t bother me too much, but I found it confusing to follow in places, and the slow pace made the book drag and drag. By the end I was really losing patience with the slow pace, and I just wanted to find out what happened and get to the end!“Zisa had fought the Devourer and saved the whole world, but apparently woodwives weren’t supposed to save people anymore. They were supposed to sit in their cottages and braid insignificant charms and never, ever dream of changing the world.”There was a bit of romance in this, but unfortunately there was a love triangle, which I didn’t really care for.“Rachelle grabbed the back of his head and kissed him, as savagely as her forestborn had once kissed her.”The ending to this was okay, but I just wanted to get it finished really. It seemed to take forever to get all the way through this, and I just lost patience with the super-slow pace.6 out of 10
