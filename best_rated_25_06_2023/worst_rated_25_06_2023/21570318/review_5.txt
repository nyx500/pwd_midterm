Reread: Audio Narration Fantastic. Book: Viscous, Ruthless, Bloody, Dark, Sexy, Villainous. Her dreams were a tangled mess of blood and shuddering treesEveryday for the last three years, she had thought she deserved to die. She still didn’t want to. She wanted to live with every filthy, desperate scrap of her heartIn the darkest of the wood stands a house. The walls are caulked with blood. The roof is thatched with bones. Within that bloody house lived Old Mother Hunger, the first and eldest of all forestbornThere were three of them, all with rapiers, and she had only a dagger. It would have been a wretchedly uneven fight, if she were human. It was still a wretchedly uneven fight; it was just in her favor."I killed somebody and I’m not sorry," she said, calmly and very distinctly. "I don’t think you want me on your alters unless blasphemy is the custom of your kingdom."Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾BLOG: https://melissa413readsalot.blogspot....
