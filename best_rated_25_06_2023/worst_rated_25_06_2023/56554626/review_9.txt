Rounded down from roughly 3.5 stars ⭐️ The Ex Hex follows exes Vivienne and Rhys. In the throes of emotional turmoil after a break up, Vivi mixes alcohol and magic, jokingly cursing her ex-boyfriend Rhys. However, when Rhys is forced to return to the town it turns out that the simple curse was much more sinister than they imagined. Can they fix things before time runs out?I loved the Halloweeny and autumnal atmosphere that shone through in this book. I desperately wanted to visit Graces Glen, to be able to experience the charming town for myself. I liked the humour that was drizzled throughout, giving the book a lovely light feel that I enjoy in any romcom! There was an element of spice and after a while I started really rooting for the characters. However, it took me a while to get there. I did find myself connecting to Aunt Elaine, Gwyn, and Sir Purrcival. I would love to see more of these secondary characters in the future.My main issue with this book is that it took me a long time to really get behind the romance. The issues that the characters claim are keeping them apart could be fixed by their magic. I found it so hard to really root for them when it felt like there weren’t any real obstacles for them to overcome. It almost felt like they were making up issues and ignoring the possibilities of their magic. I think a different romance trope would have worked better for me in this instance. It ended up affecting my connection to the main characters a little too. However, I will definitely be reading the rest of the series. This was just the light Halloweeny read that I needed! I would recommend this book to fans of romcoms, especially if you fancy one with an autumnal vibe!
