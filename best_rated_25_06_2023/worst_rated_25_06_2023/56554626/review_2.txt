4.5 starsok i had a lot of fun reading this book. literally it is perfect for spooky season. i legit felt like i was living in the small town that this book takes place in. i felt the autumn ambience and energy in my vagina...you will understand when you read it. love these characters. Vivienne was so funny and such an enjoyable character to read about. she's a badass witch that had me actually laughing out loud. i was gasping for air y'all. Rhys is a real pussy pleaser. there is something about the male love interest being Welsh that made my pussy throb. he is so hot and his dynamic/chemistry with Vivienne was done flawlessly. and this man would be calling Vivienne words of endearment in his native language even before they declared there love for one another...another thing that made my pussy throb.this was such a cute, light hearted read, with a strong plot and characters. i need more books like this
