The first of my book club’s picks! I for one will not be raving about this or giving it a glowing review. This was a pretty solid 3⭐️ read for me. Wasn’t bad but wasn’t good either. The two MCs didn’t seem to have the chemistry or background I usually crave in a Rom Com so I didn’t find myself rooting much for their relationship. To be honest, they seemed like ridiculously horny teenagers and I can only take so many of the sex scenes before it becomes redundant. You like having sex and procrastinating solving the issue at hand. We get it…This is a personal peeve and I can understand if others don’t have the same sentiments but when you drop the f bomb so much, you desensitize the reader to its value. If you hear me say this word I’m usually emphasizing a point so much that my husband, BFF or mom says “Wow. You’re pretty passionate about this.” When it’s overused by literally every individual in this book it tends to lose its effect. When Rhys says “this fucking curse”…..well you say that about everything no matter how good, bad or indifferent something actually is. I also don’t think any professional mayor of a city is going to be dropping it in normal conversation such as this one did. The word was overused and forced and made the story unconvincing. I thought the curses in the story made it more fun but I wish there was more of that and less about the sex and ‘chemistry’. I felt like it was mostly romance and not enough Halloween for my liking. Had I read this as a college student during Halloween maybe I would have enjoyed it more but this wasn’t the right fit for me now. I was very relieved to see the average rating to be about on par with my rating and to see that many other GR friends had similar sentiments about this one.
