I REALLY wanted to like this book, especially after all the good reviews and the NPR review. However, the book was just too over cluttered. Between the discovery of not one, not two, but five different women from previous novels with unusual "monstrous" characteristics, not to mention throwing Holmes and Watson in there, Goss had no time to focus on any character development, leading to an exciting plot with a bunch of people that I just didn't care about. I mean, it made Sherlock Holmes boring. Sherlock. Holmes. The other aspect that threw me was the layers of fantastical that, when taken in moderation would have added up to a clever book, but by the end bordered on the ridiculous. By the climactic ending scene, I couldn't even keep up with the number of absurd characters involved. If she had focused on telling one good story instead of five mediocre ones, this book would have been great. Sometimes, less is more.
