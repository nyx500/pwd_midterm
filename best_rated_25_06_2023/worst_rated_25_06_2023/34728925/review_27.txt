Here be monstersThis is, without a doubt, one of my top reads of 2021. Theodora Goss expertly and intelligently brought Gothic literature together in The Strange Case of the Alchemist's Daughter. I don't understand why this book isn't more hyped - because it should. It's fantastic. I was hooked from page 1. It is a brilliant homage to Gothic literature - about mad scientists, man vs nature, duality, religion vs science, isolation and monsters. While Gothic literature primarily focuses on man, Theodora Goss focuses on women and girls, and not just 'normal' women/girls, but monstrous, strange and weird women/girls. In Goss' Acknowledgments at the back, she says 'this novel began as a question I asked myself while writing my doctoral dissertation: Why did so many of the mad scientists in nineteenth-century narratives create, or start creating but then destroy female monsters? I didn't get a chance to answer that question within the dissertation itself, so I tried to answer it here, in a different way.' How brilliant! And I think she answered it: if given that much power, women could change the world. I've read Frankenstein, Dracula, and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and I loved, as I was reading this, seeing how Goss interlaced those elements and characters together. I felt like Steve Rogers when he said 'I understood that reference'. But there were stories I didn't know, that made me curious and horrified and kinda eager to read about. I thought everything about this book was well-crafted - to the characters and to the plot. The way it was written was one of my favourite things - we as a reader are consuming this book as if one of the characters, Catherine, has written and published it. It includes commentary from all of the members of The Athena Club, and it oftentimes was absolutely hilarious. It is genius. I cannot wait to pick up the second and third instalment and seeing what The Athena Club get up to next!
