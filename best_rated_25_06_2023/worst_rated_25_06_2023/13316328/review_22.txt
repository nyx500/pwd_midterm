If you like Jasper Fforde, then you probably have already read this. This was a quirky little book. I loved the new world that was unfolding of magic and dragons. I also liked the characters. They ,too, were quirky. This was a little slow to take off for me, but there was so much new information to glean that it wasn't a hardship. I will read more in this series because I was intrigued by this book. I just wanted a little more detail for both the world building and the characters. I hope I get that in the next one.
