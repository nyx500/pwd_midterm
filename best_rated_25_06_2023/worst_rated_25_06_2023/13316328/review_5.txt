This one started out really, really well -- it's been a few years since my last Jasper Fforde, and it has all his trademark features, and is decidedly Pterryish as well. You can probably see the "but" coming....At a bit over halfway in, the YA stuff is starting to bug me, big time. For sure I'm not the intended audience. Anyway, I'm going to let it rest for a day or two and start something else.It's a fast, easy read and definitely worth picking up a library copy to see if it suits you. For me, silly and fun until it started to wear thin.OK, I bounced off my new book, came back to this one, and ended up liking it pretty well. The dreamlike and arbitrary plot-turns started entertaining me again, and I do like Jennifer Strange, almost 16, the Last Dragonslayer. And I even (sort-of) liked the silly, feel-good ending. 3 stars, harmless fluff for my inner 12-year-old.
