I really enjoy Fforde's humor and this was a great escape read, which is exactly what I was looking for. This is the story of a sixteen year-old foundling who runs an employment agency for sorcerers. There was a small battle scene at the end, which I could've done without, but it's a fantasy series; what did I expect? I'm definitely continuing on with it. The laughs were priceless, and there were a couple of surprises I really didn't expect. The main characters in here are so good, particularly the protagonist, Jennifer Strange. She is a kick-ass heroine with heart, and I can never resist those. There are some non-human characters who completely stole my heart as well. Plenty of interesting themes, including greed, grief, honor, friendship, and family. I love the way magic exists in this world, which is in many ways similar to our own, and thus, quite believable. The audiobook version was wonderfully performed as well. The voice of the dragon was the best. This book is one I'll be rereading/relistening to in the future, for the performance, as well as the book itself. If you're looking for a magical escape read with lots of dry wit and some heart, too, you can't go wrong with this one in either format. Looking forward to reading the rest of the series!
