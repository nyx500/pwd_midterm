A more formal (and better xD) review of this is available on my blog. Check it out!_______________________________________I hadn't had a book infuriate me this much since A Beautiful Dark.So Wendy Everly finds out she's a changeling switched at birth, and that she's actually one of the Trylleâ”€a.k.a. trolls. She's also a princess.Every. Single. Character. In this book. Expected her to know everything about Trylle life already. Nobody even educates this girl. Sometimes Finn, the hero, tries to, but then they end up making out or some other annoying romantic activity.Wendy was so damn unlikable. She was close to being a TSTL heroine. When her mother, Elora, yelled at her about the stupidest things, she just stood there and took it. She needs to learn to stand up for herself. -_-I would've probably liked her, or at least respected her more, if she would just stop letting that bitchy mother of hers to treat her like fecal matter.I didn't like the characters, the story, the romance, nothing. But a friend of mine told me that it gets better in the sequel. I do see some potential in this series, I guess.I'd probably still read the sequel, just to see if it really gets better. I mean, I got a copy of it already. I bought it at the same time I got this one. I guess I just had high hopes for this series. :/
