Ugghh! I like Amanda Hocking. I loved her series My Blood Approves, but this book was disappointing. Originally I tried to read this when it was first self published, and couldn't finish it. I got about halfway, put it down, thinking I have way too many better things to be reading right now than this troll book. It wasn't even like I hated it, I just got incredibly bored and got to a point where realized I didn't care about Wendy or what happens to her. So we know that recently it was republished and a lot of my friends have rated this book in the 4-5 star range so I began to wonder if I was missing something. I was also prompted to try the repubbed version because it was supposedly polished up a bit, and so I gave it another try. Well, that was stupid. I should have just trusted my instincts and known that just because so many other people enjoyed this book didn't mean I would magically change my mind about it. Also, I'm really happy for Amanda and all of her success so I just really wanted to like this series.I'm not going to go into too much detail about the things I liked or didn't like, because there are a large amount of points already made for both, but as a simple short list the things I didn't like were: Wendy, Wendy's Mom, the dialog What I liked was: Flynn, the originality of the story and the changeling aspect. The world was creative, but the story and characters didn't offer much. The synopsis really made this book seem interesting, too. Oh well.To those who love this series I would like to know why. This book didn't "suck me in" from the beginning, or even by halfway.
