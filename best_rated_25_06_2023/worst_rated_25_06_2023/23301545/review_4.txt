The queen (Snow White) is preparing to marry her prince and to live happily in her kingdom until she’s informed of a sleeping enchantment that’s taken over everyone in a nearby land. She takes matters into her own hands, alongside her dwarves-at-arms, and leaves on a journey to see what this enchantment is all about. “She called for provisions, and for her horse, and then she rode out of the palace, towards the east.”Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors. I adored Snow, Glass, Apples and have enjoyed nearly everything I’ve read by him. This fairy tale was enjoyable too. It’s more of a reimagining than a retelling because it combines “Snow White” with “Sleeping Beauty” but woven into a new, unique tale with a main emphasis on the women. The writing is smooth, making this an easy read, and it’s a quick one too with under 100 pages, including the illustrations. I grabbed the physical copy and read it along with the full-cast audio. I highly recommend the audio because it helps to deeply immerse you in the story creating a richer experience.“This is not honorable,” said a dwarf. “We should stay and fight.”“There is no honor,” gasped the queen, “in fighting an opponent who has no idea that you are even there. No honor in fighting someone who is dreaming of fishing or of gardens or of long-dead lovers.”“What would they do if they caught us?” asked the dwarf beside her.”“Do you wish to find out?” asked the queen.“No,” admitted the dwarf.The Sleeper and the Spindle is dark and gothicky with some neat twists. It’s beautifully illustrated in black and white by Chris Riddell, which magnificently complements the story. The cover is stunning too! This had me engaged, but in the end, felt too short and simple with more room to grow, which left me craving more. This would be amazing as a full-length novel.Overall, this was an interesting read, and I’m glad to have read it.4****You can also see this review @www.readrantrockandroll.com
