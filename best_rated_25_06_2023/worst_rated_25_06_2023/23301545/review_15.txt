“Names. Names. The old woman squinted, then she shook her head. She was herself, and the name she had been born with had been eaten by time and lack of use.”  Story ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️In this story a strong queen goes on an adventure to save a kingdom and her sleeping princess. It’s a combination of the Snow White and the sleeping beauty fairy tale in a beautiful new way. It’s one of the most perfect children fairytales I have ever read 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Characters ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The strong female main character, the queen, was brave and a perfect role model for young children. This story didn’t need a hero, that was perfect on his white horse. It only needed a good heart and bravery. ♥️World ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Two separated kingdoms that are next to each other. One with a queen nearly to be wed. One with a sleeping princess and a curse that makes everyone fall into a deep sleep. Writing style ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Neil Gaimans writing was, as always, absolutely brilliant. Drawings ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The drawings were black and white, but had some details in a wonderful gold. The pictures were really dark and had their own special touch. It felt really magical itself and fitted the story perfectly.P.S. I got this book from the library, but will buy it for myself (and for my future children) in German and English 👑♥️
