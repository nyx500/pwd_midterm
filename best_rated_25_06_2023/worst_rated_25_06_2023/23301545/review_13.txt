Let the prince stay at home; the princess, or in this case the queen, has it covered! Neil Gaiman’s story carries an overt feminist message, subverting traditional fairy tales. In “The Sleeper and the Spindle, the women take center stage, while the men exist on the periphery. Both the hero and villain are women, imbued with the power and agency to make their own decisions, whether good or bad.  This book is actually two stories: a sort of “Snow White” meets “Sleeping Beauty”, and it features Chris Riddell’s characteristically detailed illustrations -- always just the right side of grotesque, in black and white flecked with gold. If you think you know where this story is going (as I thought I did, early on) you will probably be mistaken. Gaiman gets a lot of meaningful mileage with deceptively simple twists. “The Sleeper and the Spindle” is immensely satisfying. A seamless union of the two tales it takes its inspiration from… as sweet as it is subversive.
