You know those books that make you reconsider all your recent 4 and 5 star ratings? THIS IS THAT BOOK. I *thought* I was loving some other fantasy series I've been reading recently, but this filled a hole I didn't even know I had in my life.There are a couple of things I wish had been fleshed out more but as this is just the first in a series I am sure more of that is coming in future installments.
