At least I can marie kondo this book out of my house with no hesitation. I thought I might like it more due to my love for The Cruel Prince, but no. Itâ€™s as messy and underdone as I remember it. The ridiculous villain - emo tree! And Black seems to write the exact same protagonist. Kaye is Hazel is Jude. Jude is by far the most successful version of this girl.The only good thing about revising this old work is witnessing Holly Black to transition from grunge of Tithe to kale and thrift store hipster wokeness of The Darkest Part of the Forest to sexy pop of The Cruel Prince. I am only here for June and Cardan.Original review I loved quite a few things about this book - the setup, the fairy lore, the memory tricks, the whole "fairy-prince-sleeping-in-a-glass-coffin" idea. But the plot of this novel is objectively poor - so rushed, with everything crammed into the last third, with an underdeveloped conflict, a silly villain (a walking tree that makes you cry) and insta-romances. Black definitely had trouble plotting this story out, which was confirmed by her own "Acknowledgements" at the end of the book.
