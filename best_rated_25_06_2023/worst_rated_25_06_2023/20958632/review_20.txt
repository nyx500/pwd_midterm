A heroine who likes to kiss all the boys and kick serious evil faerie arse, persons of colour, GAY, no tropes, NOT a romance driven plot, NO love triangles, and a stand-alone all wrapped up into a lovely little YA gem. What more could we ask for?!! This book ticks all the boxes of not your average, dull, tropey YA urban fantasy. I was very pleasantly surprised! Especially since I found it unpredictable as well. It didn’t go how I expected it to go based on the synopsis and my experience with most, as in like 95% of YA books; instalove, obnoxious romance driven plots and love triangles. As well, a standalone?!!! A YA standalone?!!! It was brilliant! It was so refreshing! Trilogies have become the norm in YA these days and that’s all fun and great and all but it gets old, it’s a long term relationship, you know? And sometimes you grow apart. Lots of times the magic fizzles out and you lose that special feeling the first book gave you....So A+, Miss Black for this standalone because it’s just perfect just the way it is. Short and sweet and over. I’m satiated.
