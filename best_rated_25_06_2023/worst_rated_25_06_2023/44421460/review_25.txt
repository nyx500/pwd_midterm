A combination of sci-fi, fantasy and magical realism, this novel takes place at a café in Tokio. It revolves around transporting its characters back in time to have them reflect on themselves and change their perspectives onto a better future by finding closure with their pasts. The novel comprises four short stories, hence the rules of time travelling are explained over and over again in each chapter. Therefore, I can follow my book friends‘ criticism that the writing appears repetitive. In this context, some parts of the book felt a tad redundant to me. Furthermore, the characters and their interactions felt mechanical to me, however, this could be a very subjective perception due to cultural differences. I couldn’t connect with the characters, which is the missing element to me to feel emotionally engaged in a novel. Promising premise, which makes it the more tangible that this plot is being adapted to the screen 🍿. Difficult to rate, since the idea is brilliant, but I feel it’s execution was ‘average’; after much contemplation compared to other books in my reading experience I went for 3 stars .Thanks to NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for my honest review. 🙏IG: nilguen_reads
