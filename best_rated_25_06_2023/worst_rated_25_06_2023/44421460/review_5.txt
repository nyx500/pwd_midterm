People that can go back in time in a coffee shop? Sign me in! There are some strict rules but the character driven stories were interesting. I'm not too sure what to rate this book so it might change but... 3.5?The only story I didn't care about was the last one. I absolutely hate the trope of "woman keeps pregnancy knowing it will kill her because she wants a baby". Nope nope nope.
