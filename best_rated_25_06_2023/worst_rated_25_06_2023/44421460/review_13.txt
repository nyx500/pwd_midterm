after an hour of non-stop sobbing on my instagram story, i feel i am finally in the right headspace to cry on goodreads instead i don’t think this book is necessarily sad, the way it approaches topics like loss is so gentle, so quiet, and so unassuming that it almost feels warm in an odd little way - i felt safe within the pages of a book that appears entirely simple. it’ll be a long time before i stop thinking about what i read, i think; a long time indeeddespite the characters in this story being given a “second chance” to approach situations/people, the overwhelming feeling of knowing nothing can be done just hurts so badly, and i don’t want to delve any deeper into that, considering it would spoil way too much, but it sits in my chest, and it feels SO heavy. it felt so real, and being faced with reality sometimes feels a little too overwhelming, but as i mentioned before, the manner in which the author approaches this is so soft and so gentle. i felt safe it’s rare that a book less than 200 pages can make me feel this way, make me feel so whole and complete and yet this silly little book has managed to do exactly that. we explore the lives of so many people, so many different perspectives (sometimes within the same circumstance) that it was just incredible. so beautifully written. this book felt like a very hot cup of coffee, that ironically, never got cold
