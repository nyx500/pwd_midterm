booktok saying this book isn't sad but sobbing at the end still. yea i'd cry too if i had to read a 200-page book about women losing "everything""everything" as in each woman Kawaguchi wrote only has one purpose in their life. should've done my research and seen that this book was written by a man.first story: a smart, career woman crying over a man who chose his career over her. be fucking frsecond story: a woman devoting her life to care for her husband who has dementia. i don't have a problem with this one by itself, but after reading the other stories, there is a theme here.third story: a woman losing her freedom to run her family's inn after her little sister passed. guilt-tripped by her friend saying "that's what your sister would've wanted." no, your sister could not respect that your dreams were different than hersthe last story: she chooses to give birth knowing she will die doing so? hello? fuck off.the meaning of the stories aside, the writing was not for me either. i don't know where to pinpoint what was wrong with it, but i could not find myself immersed in any of the stories. it would take over 20+ pages to get to the exciting parts and it would be over in a page or two. the characters felt very two-dimensional and i found myself bored most of the time.
