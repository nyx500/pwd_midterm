I smell potential!When I saw this book has over 500 pages, I was sure I'd be really bored and it'll probably go in the DNF pile. But after I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! I finished it in a day and a half and couldn't wait to start the next one.This book is more HF than UF. Ok, ok, fine, I can't find the  "urban"  at all, so why do people say it's an UF.?! True, if I think of it as HF, then it probably doesn't deserve 4 stars, so yeah, let's just leave it at this...HF, as in high fantasy, btw.The main difference between the two being that that UFs are based in the real world (as much as that can be). We see modern technology or at least some semblance of "real". In HF, however, everything is of a different world, from the lore to the cities, systems, characters, etc. I'm still waiting for Kaylin to grab a gun from somewhere and just shoot the bad guy at one point...Anyway, it had a wonderful world-builder, the politics were great and engaging  -yes, I actually said that politics were fun-  and the MC has a lot of potential. The whole world is a bit more complicated than your normal "UF" (I'll just call it that) but not as hard to understand as in some HFs. Dunno what to think about Kaylin yet, I like it that she's damn clumsy and not all-powerful (yet) but most of all I love that she's got a great humor. Worth trying out at least.
