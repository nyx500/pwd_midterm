meh.this books rambles along for a couple hundred pages, and then things happen on the last few. for me, by the time i got to the last few pages, i was pretty much just hoping to finish this book and be done with it so i could go on to the next book (a new collection of Thurber James.the book is written in the form of an adolescent bibliophile's diary. that form gives it a plus: the narrator's voice, unadulterated. in this case the narrator's voice is very clear, distinctive, with an unusual and uncommonly independent point of view. the form also gives the book its downside: it rambles, it's repetitive, and it often lacks a larger, comprehensive vision, being as it is mired in the day-to-day.the other plus and minus to this book is that it refers to scads of early SF books. it's fun when you know the book she's writing about, when you are an insider. it's not so fun when you don't know the book or haven't read it for 30 years.to me, this book was a love poem to the joy of reading. but that fine aim doesn't rescue it from the mundanities of who the narrator is buying buns for at the boarding school, or how many trains one has to take to get from A to B.
