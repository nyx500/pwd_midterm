Reread - I still liked this book, just not as much as before .Thank you Netgalley for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Princess Amora has lived out her entire eighteen years on the island of Arida. Disconnected from the rest of her kingdom, Amora longs to travel to all of its islands, sailing across the high seas. The kingdom of Visidia is made up of six islands. Magic used to be practiced freely across Visidia until, as legend has it, a beast started killing those who practiced multiple magics to punish them for their greed. Now, each individual is only allowed to practice one type of magic and must live out their lives on the island which is dedicated to their chosen power. The royal family is the only family who can practice soul magic, allowing them to read souls and inflict pain without touching a person. The beast is said to live within the royal bloodline and the heir to the throne is required to prove to their people that they can control the beast. When Amora's chance to prove herself comes along, things don't go as planned. Amora is forced to flee and soon finds herself in league with a pirate on a mission to save her kingdom from a threat she had no idea existed.What I liked about this bookThe characters - I loved the characters in this book. My favourite character is Ferrick. He is so loyal and fiercely brave. I hope to see more of him and Vataea in the next book. Magic ships, pirates, mermaids - need I say more? The story - this book is full of adventure and a few twists. The pacing is great from the get go and it is consistent throughout the story.What I didn't like Absolutely nothing! - I thought really hard and I could not think of one thing I didn't like about this book.If you enjoy magic, pirate and adventure? Then this book is for you!!5 Stars ✮✮✮✮✮Find this review and others on my blog
