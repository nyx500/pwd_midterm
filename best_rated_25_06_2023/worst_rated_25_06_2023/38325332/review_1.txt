I thought I was falling off the rail with ya books but this book kicked ass! And to think, I was going to dnf this book because the beginning was all like: a princess, she’s not allowed to do shit, put her in a damn dress when she wants to be included in more important things, make her do some dumbass magic ceremony to prove her worth. Yada yada. But hell to the no!! I thought I jumped into a smidge of grimdark fantasy with a badass chic. Let’s just say her ceremony was to kill someone for reasons but she did a major over kill (that I quite enjoyed) and we were off to the races! I loved all of the characters and I will be looking forward to this new series, trilogy, whatever! Mel 😘🖤🐶🐺🐾
