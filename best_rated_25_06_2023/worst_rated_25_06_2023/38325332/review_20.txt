This is a very standard and well done YA novel, but as someone that leans more towards adult lately, it wasn't amazing for me.‚úÖ THE MAGICAL WORLD and different types of magic were really creative. I had never seen some of the magical practices and applications before so it was refreshing to see something new for once! ‚ùå SOUL MAGIC WAS NOT MY FAVORITE and even though it was definitely unique, I just didn't like it. Maybe I'm being too logical, but it just seemed like a very impractical form of magic and I could not understand why it was considered so strong.üÜó THE BOOK WAS FILLED WITH TROPES and although they aren't all bad, it just made the storyline somewhat predictable. Some things about the ending surprised me but others were definitely obvious.üÜó THE ROMANCE was cute and fun to follow but definitely PG-13. I think their relationship will likely grow a lot more in the sequel as they've both gone through a lot in this book.‚úÖ MERMAIDS ARE AWESOME! I have not read a book that incorporates mermaid before and after reading this it's definitely something more authors should do. Very feminine... very badass... perfect if you're looking for a strong female character.Overall, I thought this was well written and interesting with a lot things going for it that made it unique. If you are looking for a standard YA Fantasy novel that has a clean romance then I would recommend this to you!
