This was my most anticipated release of 2020.There are some books that have the power to transport you. They evoke your senses, they tether you to another world. They are powerful enough to make it seem like you are watching a movie through your mind's eye.And then there are books like this.I'm not going to sugarcoat it - I really didn't like this book. Everything about it felt extremely flat. The characters were cardboard cutouts. They were tropey, fanfictiony, protagonist worshipping zombies. They were robots without the metal casing - I could practically see WHY they existed in the first place, as devices for pushing the narrative or developing another character's traits, and it didn't do anything for my immersion into the story. The whole world felt completely soulless, the characters devoid of chemistry or wit. And our heroine, Amora, she's a real piece of work, this one. Once again, the immature, bratty, know it all Hermione Granger typecast, holier than thou but still edgy warrior princess character gets to be mean and pushy and naïve but somehow gets every potential suitor to fall in love with her? She pushes people and constantly has snarky comments that are uncalled for. She tells her poor poor wet towel of a fiancé that she will never love him right in front of the guys she's been openly flirting with, completely embarrassing him and giving zero f**ks. The writing is simple, almost juvenile. If there weren't some particularly gruesome scenes (and some moderately intense intimacy), I would suspect that this was tailored to a much younger audience within the YA scene. It seems like it can't make up its mind, and it kinda leaves this weird juxtaposition of morbid, shock and awe imagery but fit into this overly simplified, cartoonish mold. It's very jarring and completely threw me off.Moral of the story - if you want a good siren/pirate book, the Daughter of the Pirate King series is a far better option.Sorry I'm not sorry.
