3.25 YA Fantasy StarsI am not really into the pirate genre...or books about ships...or YA fantasy as much lately, if I'm truly honest...and yet something about this blurb intrigued me when I got my Book of the Month picks for February. I told myself I could only buy more YA books if I read any new ones right away and started to make some headway with the scores already completely littering my shelves. So here we are. I thought this was a really solid start to a new YA fantasy series. I trudged through the first part a bit (I think the first 50% took me over a week to read), but that's typical of first-in-series fantasy books where the author is busy building worlds and magic systems, etc. Things really started to pick up once I hit the halfway point though and I ended up finished it in one sitting. I really liked the magic systems used here. I wouldn't say they are wholly original or mind-blowing by any means, but they also didn't feel like complete carbon copies of all the other fantasy systems out there. I especially enjoyed the darker nature of Amora's magic. Because blood and stabby-ness always make this girl's day. There were some minor twists that I saw coming and some that were mildly surprising. I do wish some of the characters has been a little more developed. But all in all, a really solid start and I will be picking up book two whenever it comes out.
