I love pirates, but have been let down with a lot of the pirate-type books! However, here is one that totally changed my mind! I'll also add that the cover is one of my favorites of the year!Amora was pretty freaking awesome! I easily connected with her and what she was going through and had to face! Then there were the boys! I loved Bastian and Ferrick, especially Bastion, though! And Vataea has my heart! She was vicious and lovable at the same time! The bond between the crew was one that I would want to truly be a part of.All I want in my life right now is to set sail on Keel Haulâ€”that's the ship, by the way! The author put a whole unique spin on the pirate life with wonderful and vivid descriptions that had me captivated from one. Now, give me all the bones and all the magic, and I'm seriously excited for book 2!
