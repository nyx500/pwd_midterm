Full review postedI don’t think this book is TERRIBLE, I just think that the synopsis DECEIVED me and I’ve faced too much betrayal from my loved ones books to continue being a victim to such treachery I’m lying, I clearly never learn since I keep reading kasie west booksPros *this gonna be short oops-	Asian setting!!!!!!!!-	its pretty gruesome, so if you’re into that it might appeal to you I guess :|-	um…girl power but done like sneakily so youre not sure if the characters are evil-villainous-pieces-of-trash or their strong-willed-freedom-fighting-heros-	the mc literally takes no crap from anyone, except her crappy aunt, but she deals with her pretty quickly (s) Cons-	where do I start?-	Okay the writing is LONG, DRAWN OUT, AND LITERALLY ENCOURAGES YOU TO SKIM bc its just :|-	The world building is so confusing and hard to grasp, my poor brain rip-	I didn’t like the mc, shes selfish and vain and annoying and keeps reminding everyone how oh so terrible she is without OUTWARDLY saying WHY she is so terrible so idk she’s basically poop sorry -	I. was. Bored.-	There were SO MANY characters that could have been developed more and provided an excellent conflict but nope they pretty much get thrown into the trash bin and poof, they are never seen again -	Basically the ending is really ACTION PACKED but the 300 pages leading up to it is like an exam and a half to get through -	Also what the poop was up with all THE WOMEN HATING EACH OTHER WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN-	The romance was weird as hell ??? there was no connection between her and wei and then all of a sudden another dude gets into the picture and just ugh im over it-	But literally EVERYONE loved this aside from me, so there’s a 9/10 % chance you’ll like it even tho I really didn’t :)“She was a monster, a bride of the darkness, and she rose to face her destiny as though it were the blood-red sunrise of a new day.”1.5 stars!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Buddy read with saunta khalusidk WHY EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING THIS COVER IS UGLY ITS NOT UGLY ITS PRETTY
