dnf @ 30%I'm really not getting into this. The writing style or characters just aren't drawing me in at all and I'm at page 150 and feel like nothing has happened. I decided to read the last page too see what was happening and nothing really intrigued me to want to read this. Plus feels a waste of time to read a book I know I probably won't rate very high. I don't think this book is bad it's just not working for me
