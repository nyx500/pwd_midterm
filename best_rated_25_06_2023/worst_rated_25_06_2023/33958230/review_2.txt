This was SO good and I'm just really angry that it took me so long to read it (or listen to it actually). I loved how it twisted a lot of the typical elements of fantasy but also added the richness of the culture it was thoroughly steeped in. A great retelling overall that I HIGHLY recommend!*I read this as part of Penguin Teen's Fall Into Fantasy readathon where this was my featured buddy read.*
