"In weakness, you find your strength. It takes no small amount of courage to open yourself up"Spoiler Free Review!Holy shit this was amazing! I have no idea what to think when I went into this... but not THAT! Firstly it's partly a re-telling that has set up the second book perfectly, then we have an anti-heroine (which I didn't even know about!), it's dark and twisted but so gripping. The progression of the book moved at a gradual pace, nothing seemed to be rushed. Not only this the writing was so well done. I think what made this book so gripping is that there were many plots going on underneath the surface and you didn't know who you could entirely trust."Your beauty is all you are, and all you have. Your only weapon."Our main character is Xifeng, when we first meet her character I didn't really know what to think of her, she has something very very dark in her, we see her being abused by her Aunt and wants something better in her life. Her character development what phenomenal, the way in which she thinks and plots and how she overcomes certain aspects was just so well done. We see her flaws and her embrace them, some things were grotesque and at some points I was inwardly screaming.Some are given a rope to the moon, and others claw up to the sky.What I liked?- The storytelling we see throughout, it was so gripping and in them they felt like fairytales.- All of the little references of Snow White- Her friendship with Kang- Even though some bad things happened, I kind of felt sorry for Xifeng... I KNOW!- How dark it was, I didn't expect it to be like this!There was honestly nothing I disliked about this book!Ovverall, if you love Fairytale re-tellings I'd highly recommend this. It's set it up perfectly for the next book. I honestly can't wait! For the month of November I read books only from Subscription boxes and I'm ridiculously happy I finished with this!
