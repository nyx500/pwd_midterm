It’s been a while since I’ve enjoyed a fantasy as much as I enjoyed this. Forest of a Thousand Lanterns was dark, gritty, unique and unpredictable. I thought the way the narrative of the Evil Queen was woven into the story was so incredibly clever and Xifeng was one of the most intriguing and complex protagonists (antagonist?!) I’ve encountered in a while. The wait until the next book in this series is going to be a painful one but I have no doubt it will be worth it.
