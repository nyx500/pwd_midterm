The Regency-plus-magic in which Jane takes us through the tiniest shades of her emotions regarding her plainness, her relationship with her beautiful sister, Melody, and her marriage prospects, while the magic is confined to literally decorative use. I didn't care for this. The pacing was such that for almost two hundred pages nothing happens but feeeeelings, and then suddenly revelations and chases and duelling pistols and so on are rushing by so quickly that the characters don't seem to be able to register them. I got very tired of Jane's insecurities. The key romantic relationship is weirdly both heavy-handed and undersupported. In the acknowledgements, the author says that Jane Austen "has taught me much about the importance of small details." So I don't feel so petty about being really irritated by so many small details, such as young Regency ladies falling asleep "without undressing" (I think you mean "without summoning a maid to undress her," and I also think it's quite unlikely that anyone could sleep in full Regency drag), gentlemen introducing their daughters to solicitors using their first names, and anyone of that time period accepting the hideous neologism "glamural."Edited to add: I just remembered: A perfectly ordinary marriage conducted within like a week of the engagement, with no special license and no publishing of the banns! Little things like this add up to a Regency setting that feels thin and inauthentic.
