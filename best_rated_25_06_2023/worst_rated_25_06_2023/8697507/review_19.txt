I finished Shades of Milk and Honey by Mary Robinette Kowal and I was bit mixed; from early word of mouth and reviews I have expected a more substantial book rather than the very light beach reading novel this turned out to be; it is pretty much Jane Austen light, without any real social commentary or depth to the world building, all revolving around relationships and romance, while magic is pretty in-essential to the story except as a vehicle of allowing the main character to 'shine" as a "plain" woman in a patriarchal society where beauty or at least prettiness and the lack of would have been otherwise determinant.Once you accept what the book is, it's very well written and enjoyable to the end, a fast 2-3 hour read perfect for summer.Overall if you are into light historical romance I would recommend this, but I hope the author uses her considerable writing skills to pen a deeper book
