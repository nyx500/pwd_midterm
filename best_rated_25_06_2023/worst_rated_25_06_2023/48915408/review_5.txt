Since ARCs of my book are beginning to enter the world (and I am henceforth banning myself from Goodreads, which is a space for readers, not authors), I thought it would be a good time to provide some grounding and content warnings for THE WOLF & THE WOODSMAN. I've pitched this book as having a "magic system based on body horror," which is I think apt - and so, naturally, there are a lot of graphic, on-the-page depictions of gore. (I've listed out the various iterations of that below). I think it's also worth noting that this is fundamentally a book about nation-building, which I depict as a violent process that requires constant, aggressive forms of propaganda (aka, fairytales) in order to maintain. Religious persecution, cultural genocide, and ethnic cleansing are at the core of this book. My aim is, obviously, not endorsement, but rather a realistic representation of the oppression and marginalization experienced by ethnoreligious minorities. I am anticipating that some will categorize this book as grimdark, though I'm ambivalent to that descriptor myself. TL;DR: Gore and genocide abound. Also, this book is not YA; it is adult. Take care of yourselves, and stay safe!Content warnings:- Gore, including graphic descriptions of dismemberment, amputation, mutilation, and immolation- Torture, including whipping- Self-harm, including self-amputation - Animal death (graphic; the animals are not pets)- Antisemitism- Cultural genocide and ethnic cleansing- Physical abuse by parents and parental figures- Graphic descriptions of vomiting
