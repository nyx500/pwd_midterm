4.5 flaming stars! 🌟 This was even better the 2nd time round. When I initially read, I didn’t think I’d enjoy it. My expectations were low because I judged it purely on my dislike for The Wrath and the Dawn duology. Which is stupid, and I'm glad I was proven wrong, because I  LOVED  it. Such captivating, Mulan inspired story, in a world which had an enchanting Japanese backdrop, where the writing was so gorgeous I wanted to lap it up, and had such a bad-ass main character, Mariko. I loved everything she stood for, determined on destroying patriarchy and finding a voice for herself. There's a lot of groundwork that has been set up in order for the story to be built upon and develop in the next book and it makes me so damn excited to see where it's headed! 😍
