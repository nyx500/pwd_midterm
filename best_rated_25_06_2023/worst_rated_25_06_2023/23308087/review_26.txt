Like honestly, it's 1am and I'm staring at my bedroom wall wondering why I did this to myself ??  ಥ_ಥ   ಥ_ಥ   ಥ_ಥ Review to come when I discover how to stop sacrificing sleep! **********************PRE-REVIEW: I seen this somewhere on Goodreads and my eyes literally fell off my head. Why??IT'S A FUCKING MULAN RETELLING !! Yes, you read that right. Your eyes aren't failing you. MULANYeah, I'm hella thrilled for this book like cmon. I can't be alone in this??? *breathes*Hands DOWN, Mulan has to be one of my favourite characters from Disney. She's absolute badass like yessssssss. I can feel the awesomeness of her character without even reading the book. You can't mess up Mulan. If you do, I WILL FIGHT YOUUUUUU. Can we talk about the cover?? Oh my goodnessIT'S BOOOOOOOOOOOTIFUL. STUNNING. GORGEOUS. YUMMY. OHHHH LAWD, I'M SO PUMPED FOR THIS I'm lowkey debating whether I should build a tent in front of the bookstore the night before it's release. Yup, it sounds like a solid plan. (Anyone is free to join me, just bring FOOD!!)
