How have I not reviewed this book? FLAME IN THE MIST is the first in a new series from Renee Ahdieh and it is FANTASTIC. I adored THE WRATH AND THE DAWN, of course, and thought the story wrapped up beautifully in THE ROSE AND THE DAGGER. But to be honest, no one can live up to smart, badass Shazi, right? Right?Wrong, wrong, wrong. Mariko is a smart, brave, careful, flawed and incredibly original. I wanted to take her out of the book and get her to teach me alchemy. I want her and Shazi to meet and bond over all the crap they have to put up with. But Mariko isn't the only incredible character. From her twin brother Kenshin, to the Emperor, to the members of the black clan, all of the characters in this book are fully developed and deeply fascinating. I needs some novellas, pronto. As in Renee's other books, you can expect incredible descriptions of food and clothing and people and scenery--all the lush writing that makes you feel like you are living the story. The research that went into this book was intense, and it shows. I genuinely felt like I had been dropped into Mariko's world. The pacing is non-stop--I tore through this. But my FAVORITE part of the book was the romance. Insert all the fire emojis here. Pre-order it, get your hands on an ARC, trade a soul or two...it's worth it for this book. Renee, you can give me book 2 now, please.
