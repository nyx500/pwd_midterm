This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription “Half of winning, my dear wallet, is simply looking victorious.” 🌟 This was one of my most anticipated books for the year and given how much I love Six of Crows, I thought I would love this one! My problem is that I wanted something as awesome as SoC and not another milder copy of that book.🌟 I have been searching and asking and reading reviews since I started this and it looks readers are divided into two groups; one group can not notice the similarity and one group can not Un-notice the similarity to SoC!! I belong to the second group.🌟I think the book itself is good but even if we put comparisons aside, it still has some problems that I am explaining next.🌟 The world building was good which is why I am starting with it and I know there will be many improvements and revelations in the next book.🌟 The plot was different from SoC which was good. I haven’t read many heist books but I guess they will always have some common things in between and the author added her touch to this kind of stories!🌟 Now the problematic part which was the writing style and characters. While Roshani has a good style and it could be captivating, it was confusing at many points and I found that I was not the only one confused by this as many of the reviews I found mentioned this!🌟 The characters were not bad, but I felt that Séverin was like Kaz and Laila was like Inej. But they were not as well written. I have a friend who keeps telling me that Kaz is one son of a Gun but Séverin and the rest of the crew here were not as cool and relatable as the crew in SoC! I wish I liked them more because I would have enjoyed the book heaps more.🌟 Summary: I didn’t want to compare this book to SoC but unfortunately I was doing that while reading the whole 464 pages and found many similarities. To be honest though, maybe because it is a heist story and there must be some common themes. I enjoyed some parts and I may do a re-read later before going into book 2. I was just waiting for that moment where everything clicks in but the book ended and I didn’t get it! I am sure the book will have many fans and 5 stars ratings though!🌟 ARC provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
