this book is serving some major ‘six of crows’ meets ‘the da vinci code' realness and i had no idea that was something i needed in my life until now. gosh, with a story this good, where do i even begin? the massive cast of diverse and interesting characters who have each made their way into my small heart? the intricate and highly thought-out plot that constantly delivers twists and turns at every corner? the effortless and gorgeous writing which paints a historically stunning world filled with delicious food, breathtaking sights, and cunning individuals? this story is the ultimate treasure hunt and X marks everything i love about it. and sure, no matter how much i rave about this, it isnt without its problems. there are some massive info dumps that take some effort to sort through, the acute focus on details can make the writing seem dense (and even confusing) at times, and there are some inaccuracies with the french translations. but once you get past those minor hiccups, this story has sooo much to offer. i honestly feel that, with this book, roshani chokshi has finally come into her own and made the transition from queen to goddess. i am so glad this was signed on as a trilogy because i cant wait to see where this story goes and how its built upon. and i have a strong feeling i am not going to be disappointed. ↠ 4.5 stars
