Definitely took me a longggg time to finish. I feel like the writing style is kind of a double-edged sword, because it has such a dreamy, fairy tale ambience, which I love, but it can also be really hard to follow. Like I would think a sentence would be about to end, but lo and behold, we still got 30 words left. Another odd thing is that there's a ton of detail and description, but I still feel like the characters and places are a little hazy. I think the ending is the best part, and there's enough of a spin on the story that I wasn't exactly sure what would happen. Actually I kind of even forgot what fairy tale retelling I was reading. I like the animals, I like that it's strong female characters, honestly I even like the magic system/description even though I'm pretty sure the rules are just made up for whatever works for the story at that moment.Overall, I wouldn't say it's a bad book, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to people, I think I would point to some of her other books first (maybe only one other book because I think maybe I've only read one other).
