I have read a number of books by this author and really liked all of them, but this one is a standout for me. It is a retelling of the Sleeping Beauty story, but goes far beyond the limitations of the original tale. The author manages to create a delightful, suspend-disbelief magical kingdom and populates the story with fully rounded characters who are both entertaining and engage the reader's sympathies, along with a plot line that departs from fairy tale formula just enough to keep us guessing the outcome clear to the end. Her independant spirited Beauty manages to foil all the trappings of fairy tale while still eventually finding her own definition of a happy ending. This is a story that embodies the antidote to the current 'princess' obsession among young girls without being cynical or dark in any way. From the first page description of a land so full of magic that teakettles need to be routinely 'de-magicked' by local fairies to keep them from pouring out pansies or toads, the readers interest is caught and held to the end of the book.
