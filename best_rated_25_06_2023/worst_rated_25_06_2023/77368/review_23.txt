Gourd, FINALLY.McKinley, thou hast let me down. Three stars for not-terrible ideas and flowing, if ponderous style. First, an incidental note that bothers me about many of McKinley's re-tellings. The influence of Disney is OBVIOUS, pervasive, and somewhat distracting. It may be hypocritical of me, since I love a good fanfic, but the fact that it's in print from a major publisher assumes (to me) originality. If one is re-telling Sleeping Beauty, one is obligated NOT to make one's evil character a purple-and-black, tall, beautiful, ancient fairy who "has never had a good lieutenant." Named, not Maleficent, but Pernicia. The first two hundred pages were about a 4-star. There really isn't any central character, but it's 200 pages covering twenty-one years, so the vast, macroscopic view works pretty well for me. I could still enjoy it because of the depth of imagination, even though it gets a bit flowery and overblown in places. To explain: this is the fantasy novel that Henry James would have written. You know, you're reading along about somebody sitting at a window seat, and then all of a sudden we're zeroing in on the history of a stitch in a glove and how long that glove has been stitched? Yeah. It's like that. The history of every non-entity and non-character is expounded upon in some depth.This makes it a bit plodding, but isn't so bad-- until you get to about part four. The last 150 pages of this book are a freaking chore. Because the style remains meandering, refusing to settle on any one character's perspective, but now we're covering a period of about 24 hours. Beginning with a long-winded flashback covering the previous three months. After Evil Fairy finally does her thing, we get into the TRULY torpid part of the book.***SPOILERS***THIRTY PAGES. Of waking up, wandering around the castle, wondering what the hell to do and noting that everyone is asleep. Kitchen? Asleep. Labyrinth down below? Asleep. Great hall? Asleep, asleep. (Except for a small band of intrepid furry friends, who need to justify their existence in this book by doing something remotely plot-significant. Like killing off the phantasms who seem invented expressly for the purpose of giving yon intrepid band something to do. Grr.)Then, having finally escaped aforementioned Palace of Dulldrums, we find ourselves-- in a fifty page dream sequence. Fuck.Now, one of the interesting things about magic in this book is that it works something like the subconscious. There are no rules. If you look straight at it, it melts. Sometimes. Unless it doesn't. HOWEVER, at some point, the lack of rules and rather ill-defined nature of magic in this world begins to seem either very poorly explained, or made-up-as-we-go-along. It was definitely feeling like the latter for me during this sluggish, ehem, climax. (Which was also replete with a lot of random close-ups, flashbacks, and head-scratching.)Again, this might not be so bad-- this plodding, omniscient and unemotional view of everything-- if there were not an obvious, simultaneous attempt for speed and urgency. Take, for example, the frenzied, desperate gallop toward the end-- which is interrupted to tell us about the horse's history of not-races that he has consistently won in front of various nobility. (And how did a girl who can't ride POSSIBLY keep her seat through all that?) Magic, I guess. Sigh.***Double Spoilers***Why, WHY didn't the book end with Rosie biting it and Peony taking her place as princess? A unique, bittersweet twist on the classic tale. They've both "absorbed" each other in preparation for this. The peasant could die, the princess live. The fairy would get her revenge, although it doesn't matter because everyone would have thought she killed the wrong one. It could end with Peony petting an aging Fast, drawn to spend time with him though she knows not why. WHY does Narl have to suddenly requite (and have-requited) Rosie's feelings? In literally the second to last page of the book. (Gag!) Why does love always have to be requited? Rosie was superfluous, futureless, and single. In short, ripe for death. (Sorry single folks.) Why drag out this pointless battle and save everybody?Only advantage to her not-death: that kiss was Quite unexpected.
