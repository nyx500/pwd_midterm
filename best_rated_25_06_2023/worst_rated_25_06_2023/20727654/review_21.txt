1.5 Stars. Can you hear that? That is the sound of all my hopes and dreams being crushed. This book looked so good at the beginning; the characters were likeable and the magic idea was amazing. Magical animated origami sounds like something that was written just for me. Can you image animating this? Because I totally can. I'd be folding and animating random things all day long. Then the problems start: the magical system has no specified set of rules and limitations. This of course means that at some point the author will use "magic" to get her characters out of problems that have no other solutions.And then it all goes to hell... the plot makes absolutely no sense at all. NONE.  Going on a trippy journey through the literal heart of Mg. Thane? Seriously? . And Ceony, who has what? Two weeks of Magician training? saves the day because magic-ex-machina! (Told you it was going to happen...)And that was it. I am so disappointed right now.
