Full Review Liked the beginning and the end, but the middle was sloooow What I liked - I liked the unique concept of the story. Before reading, I thought ‘The Paper Magician’ was some sort of metaphor but it’s actually about a magician that can manipulate paper. It may seem boring (and the MC thought that at first) but the manipulations were actually quite interesting. There are also other magical affinities such as fire, glass and metal. There is also the dark affinity which is the manipulation of flesh. This book mostly focused on the paper and flesh affinities. I also liked how people aren't born with a magical power, but they get to choose and bond with one.- I loved the relationship!!! There wasn’t any romance in this but it is hinted and I shipped them!! It has a forbidden angle (Teacher and Student, a big age gap: 19 and 30, which just made me ship them even more lol. I just love how they did things for each other before any romance was even hinted at. This is slow-burn/friendship first type of situation and I loved it! What I didn’t like - The middle was so slow: It pretty much involved going down memory lane for a long time and it reminded me of books that have long travelling sections. I just wanted it to be over!! - I didn’t understand/saw the point of some of the things that the villain did in this  Why did she trap the girl in his heart instead of just killing her?? Overall, it was okay and I would continue reading the books for 3 reasons: The books are really short, like a little bit over 200 pages, the slow middle seemed like it was unique to this book and thirdly, I want to read about my ship sailing!!! Pre-reading I really hope there is romance in this because the last two books I read didn't really have any, which is bad for my romance addiction
