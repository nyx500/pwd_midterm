This book came along at just the right time for me. I needed something light and magical, and this book did what I expected. I loved the magic system. It was different, and I think it worked well. I particularly liked Ceony, the main character. She was interesting and bold, and I particularly loved the relationship that she formed with the dog. I liked her independence, and the the way that she wasn't treated like a second class citizen, just because she is female. It isn't relevant, but the front cover is gorgeous. The design would be enough to encourage me to pick this one up. I have took two stars off this book as for one, the plot became rather dull halfway through reading, and I found I had to push through, which is never a good sign, and two, the romance. Without saying too much, I do think it was incredibly rushed, and I do wonder, whether it was actually necessary to include it at all? Time will tell!
