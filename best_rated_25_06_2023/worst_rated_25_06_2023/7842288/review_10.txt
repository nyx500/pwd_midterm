I'm still totally captivated by this series.The dept and complexity of the plot just keeps getting better and better. There is so much more to this book and answers so many of the questions I had in the first book.So why the four star rating? Well Lena.I just couldn't like her in this book and I'm not sure I want to like her. And she influence everyone around her to be lesser of what I would like them to be. This is actually a excellent quality the writers have, to portray this influence so correctly. But that didn't make me want to stab Lena less.The setting of this book and the new "world" - for lack of better word - was awesome. I love that we get go down into the Caster tunnels and get to know more Casters and the humans assisting them. I love how complex this "sixteenth moon" has become.I can't wait to see where our journey takes us next.
