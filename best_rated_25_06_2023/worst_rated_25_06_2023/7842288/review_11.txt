After loving the first book in the series, this disappointed me. It picks up after Lena's birthday where she still hasn't chosen a side and there is a love triangle thrown in there too for no absolute reason. Both Ethan and Lena became different people. I liked both of them in the first book but in this they both became so annoying and made stupid decision after stupid decision. Link, Macon and Ridley were the only ones that I found interesting to read about. I would have liked it more if it didn't drag this much. I tried but didn't like it as much as I had wanted to.2 stars
