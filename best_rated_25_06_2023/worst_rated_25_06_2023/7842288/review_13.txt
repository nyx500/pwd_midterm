Another enjoyable book from Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl! Yay!I must admit, Beautiful Darkness took much longer for me to get into than Beautiful Creatures. Garcia and Stohl tend to throw plenty of description and information at the reader for the first three hundred pages, and makes you think, How is this all going to come together? However, they weave that into a heart-stopping climax that makes you regret ever doubting them in the first place. This novel is quite different that the last book. For the most part, the setting is very different, and the romance between Ethan and Lena is no longer at center stage. No complaints here, since I loved the development of the Caster world and look forward to seeing more of it in future installments.My favorite thing about Beautiful Creatures was its cozy, Southern setting and characters. In Beautiful Darkness, like I said, the setting may be different some of the time, but the characters are still there. I loved the development of some of the supporting characters. Ridley was probably my favorite character from the last book, so seeing her become one of the main characters in this novel was refreshing. And, even though they only seemed to be used for the progression of the plot, the additions of Liv and John were nice, too. Oh, and Lucille the cat is very present in this book, too. What's not to love about that?Lena was absent for long stretches of this book, and I must admit, I did miss her. Some loathe her character, but I find her to be a refreshing change of pace from all the other YA heroines out there (-cough- Bella, Ever, Luce, Zoey -cough-). Also, I know some do not like Ethan’s point of view because they feel he is not a realistic teenager, but I don’t think he is terribly unrealistic.Overall, these two authors fascinated me again; there’s a reason why this is my favorite YA paranormal series. The cliffhanger ending left me staring at the page blankly (and angrily), and I cannot wait for the next installment.
