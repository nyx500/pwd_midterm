I didn't have high expectations for this book after how the first book was somewhat disappointing, but I surprisingly really enjoyed this one! It was a big improvement from Beautiful Creatures and thank goodness there was less mention of Confederates in this book. Still could've used a bit more representation though...The plot of the book seems so simple and laid out based on the ending of the first book, but plot twists come out of no where that take the story in an interesting direction. I was pleasantly surprised by all the twists in the book. I thought it would be a repetition of the first book, but this one made the characters more complex and I loved getting to explore the Tunnels. The Tunnels are the kind of thing that I'd love to see a video game made about.This book was a bit slow at first, but I'm not complaining too much. We got so many Ridley and Link moments that made my heart sore. Ridley and Link are such great characters and I'm dying to read the Dangerous Creatures series that seems to focus on those two characters. One of the cool things about this book is that even though it's a fantasy/paranormal book, there was a great depiction of grief and guilt in this book. Grief is a topic that's often skimmed over in books, but the authors chose to dive deep into this topic and accurately portray how death effects the living. I really appreciate that.Overall I highly enjoyed this one. If you can make it through the first book in this series, I really hope you enjoy Beautiful Darkness as much as I did.
