Mokoya and Akeha are twins of the great Protector, thought of as royalty, and sold to the Great Monestry as children. Both are gifted children, but it's Mokoya who has the misfortune to draw her mother's attention. As a prophet, they can devine the near future. A future than cannot be changed. As rebellion stirs, it's twin Akeha who we see decide who they want to be and want they want to right for as the passage of time occurs. I loved some of the themes presented here. We have a richly imagined world that has a magical system heavily linked to spirituality, construction and the elements. It's never really explained but rather left up to the reader to unravel, as we see it used through the twins and in the architecture around them. It sits well besides the main story, naturally slotting into the narrative to enhance the plot. I also really liked the gender fluidity that is examined through Mokoya and Akeha. This is a world where children are not given a gender at birth, but instead are allowed to move organically through the process of deciding for themselves who they are. This can take 3 years, 10 years, or sometime their whole life to discover. Gender is never defined by one singular aspect of an individual.I do think that the short length results in a lack of character development and the pacing is off in places. We take large time jumps through the story, moving quickly from the twins childhood through to adulthood and because of this we miss out on a lot of their development and emotional growth. Akeha always feels a little standoffish, which meant I struggled to connect with them at times. The plot also doesn't do enough to build up the background behind the rebellions and why they're occuring, which would have helped me understand the world a bit better. Great novella with some interesting insights that you don't see enough of in fantasy, I'm intrigued enough to continue on in the series.
