“The black tides of heaven direct the courses of human lives. But as with all waters, one can swim against the tide.”What a stunner! What a beauty! I've had this series on my radar for a while because a) that cover b) I knew it was queer. So I kicked myself in the butt, bought a copy and fell in love with Mokoya and Akeha. They're royal twins with magical powers born to a ruthless and power-hungry empress. As all children in this world, they are born non-binary and eventually choose a gender when they feel ready (awesome concept, huh? Maybe we should try that sometime). I don't want to give too much away except that this book is about inequality and power and, of course, magic.This is a short novella and therefore a quick read. Which is why I think the world-building was really well done. There's no info-dumping, most of it is showing rather than telling. Sometimes that means that unanswered questions remain but it doesn't hinder your understanding of the world. Just makes you more curious. I must say I loved the beginning more than the end. There are huge time jumps in this short story and I would have liked to see the twins' childhood and youth explore more. It also makes it difficult to relate to the characters on an emotional level because things happen too fast.Regardless, it's a unique, original story set in a magnificent and very queer fantasy world and I so want to read more. Good thing I have three more novellas with three gorgeous covers waiting for me.Find more of my books on Instagram
