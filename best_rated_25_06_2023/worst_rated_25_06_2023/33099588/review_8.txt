My Video Review:https://youtu.be/lGylZwlX2FkWow this was so good! I really liked the society and how everything was set up. Akeha was such a great character to read about, and I liked the dynamic between Akeha and Moko. Their abilities were awesome and I loved the magic system. The Slack was really cool and I liked that the twins could communicate through it instead of talking out loud when they wanted. Also, in this world, people do not immediately have a gender assigned to them. They confirm or don't when they decide they identify as male, female, or neither. The two twins' powerhouse mother, The Protector, was an interesting antagonist that I loved to hate. I think the romances and some plot points happened too quickly, so it was jarring at those points, but overall, it's a very entertaining and wonderful read. I really want to know what will happen in the second novella.
