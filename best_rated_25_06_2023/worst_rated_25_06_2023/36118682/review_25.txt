[Update: After researching the messed up shit Emily has done, I'm removing my rating. For more info: https://mobile.twitter.com/RinChupeco...https://www.distractify.com/p/emily-d... If your still interested in reading this book, I urge you to get it second hand or from the library!]“What happens when a monster tries to become a god?”Gosh, this book was such a ride. I wish I could say I liked all of it but the start was super slow. Though despite the rocky beginning, everything after was a masterpiece!Wicked Saints is a pretty dark book and discusses issues of morality, religion and war through our 3 main characters which I have to say, were beautifully written characters. Literally *chefs kiss*. All three characters, Nadya, Malachiasz and Serefin all have opposing views and backgrounds but despite that, team up for the common goal.Words cannot explain how much I LOVE this book so I’ll show you guys some beautiful quotes instead :)“He was a nightmare but he was gentle.”“Dazzle the monsters, Nadya. You've already charmed the worst of the lot; the rest should be easy.”“Intentions were not always kind nor just.”“If she tore out her own heart would this stop? If that was the thing betraying her, then she would be rid of it. Anything to stop from being pulled to this terrible boy.”“Monsters are real, and I am their king.”Overall this was a beautiful book, I’d recommend this to literally everyone if I could!5 stars 🌟Buddy read with Taylor & Krista <33
