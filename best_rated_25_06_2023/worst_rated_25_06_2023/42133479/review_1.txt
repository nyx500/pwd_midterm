And it was everything that I wanted a more.I absolutely loved the Korean mythology and it was perfectly woven into the story. The characters? Amazing. I love them and the relationships that were formed. My heart also broke for them. I'll talk about it more in my wrap up, but GET EXCITED FOR THIS! This comes out 25 June!Thank you so much Penguin Random House for providing me with an ARC! I am eternally grateful.
