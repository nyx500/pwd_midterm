I am obsessed! I loved this so much!Going into this book I already knew I was going to love it. A book about a Gumiho, a nine tailed fox that has to consume the energy of men to survive. I love Kitsune’s so I knew I’d love reading about a Gumiho. This book was a lot of fun. The characters were amazing and I fell in love with them instantly. I did a reading vlog where I read this book. You can check it out to hear more of my thoughts: https://youtu.be/81zW2nq1_v0
