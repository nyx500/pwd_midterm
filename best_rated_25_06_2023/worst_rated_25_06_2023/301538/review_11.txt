Maybe one of the most compelling and complex fantasy reads I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I was turned away from this series on a number of different occasions because I had read so many reviews that trashed it as self-serving pseudo-intellectual drivel. Well, I'm glad I finally put all of that aside and gave it a go because in my opinion, nothing could be further from the truth. It does require a great deal of patience and fortitude because Bakker does you no favors as far as holding your hand and info-dumping you to death. You as the reader are kind of just dropped into an already developed story on page 1 with various factions vying for dominance of the continent they inhabit. But that is also part of the brilliance of this book, nothing is spelled out, yet you have enough understanding to piece together what is going on and what will eventually take place. I sincerely hope that the next two books are this good because if so, I will absolutely fly through them like I did with this first installment. Bravo Mr. Bakker, what a wondrous world you have created filled with deep characters and a history that makes you want to constantly find out more about it. I simply adored this book and can't say enough good things about it.
