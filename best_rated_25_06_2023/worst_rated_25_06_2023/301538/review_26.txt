In my ongoing exploration of Worldbuilding on my blog, I've found the observations and thoughts of many different authors to be of use, including LeGuin and Moorcock--but it's been M. John Harrison's approach that I find most intriguing, because he begins the work of setting up a working theory for what worldbuilding is, how it operates, and why certain writers and fans may be attracted to it.Of course, his views on worldbuilding are not very flattering, and as such, they have inspired a massive backlash from those fans and writers. While they have tried to defend worldbuilding as a valid and unique tool for writers to take advantage of, I have unfortunately never seen a response to Harrison that actually refutes his interpretation, or that provide any alternative theory for how worldbuilding operates, or what might make it a useful approach.Many fans have pointed to Bakker as a great defender of worldbuilding, and they are fond of quoting his response to Harrison (buried in this interview). The quotes seemed to show a writer who was lucid and intelligent, and so I was excited by the prospect of finally seeing an actual attempt to defend worldbuilding, refute Harrison, and provide some alternative view of what authors can achieve with this technique.Disappointingly, instead of addressing Harrison's thoughts and words, Bakker sidetracks into impugning his motives--though as an off-the-cuff response in an interview, I don't blame him for failing to present a complete defense (I analyze the exchange more fully in this post). After that post, Mr. Bakker was kind enough to show up on my blog to address my concerns.I would expect that a great proponent of worldbuilding in his own books would have put suitable thought into the technique to have some good insights into it, but as the exchange went on and gradually petered out, Bakker didn't seem to have much to say on the subject. There was nothing to indicate that he possessed an approach to well-written, worldbuilding-focused fantasy, and as such, I'm afraid it's back to the drawing board for me. Perhaps someday, I will find that great defense of worldbuilding, a refutation of Harrison's theory, the presentation of an alternative view, or even a book which uses the technique to great effect--but today is not that day, and Bakker does not seem to be that author.My Suggested Readings in Fantasy
