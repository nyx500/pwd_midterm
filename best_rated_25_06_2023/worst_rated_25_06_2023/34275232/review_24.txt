I enjoyed the first half of the book because of all the mystery and potential. The easy pacing and small fantastical elements were like comfort food. However, the second half lost my interest once it dived into a string of nonsensical fairy-tale events. The character development and ending were unsatisfying. I didn't hate it, but it's a bit of a shame that the book didn't stick to the landing when it had more potential.
