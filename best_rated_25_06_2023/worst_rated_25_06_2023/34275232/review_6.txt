So let's see how it goes! I think I jinxed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just wasn't feeling it and that makes me sad =( But, we can't love them all. I did enjoy the character of Finch, he was my favorite! "Hi," I said, flustered. I was on my way home from work. My shirt was covered in scone crumbs and my hair was spiked with sweat. "You smell like a coffee bean," he said when we reached the corner. "It's awesome." He glanced back at the restaurant, his face so full of regret I almost laughed. "Okay, I better get back.""Back to stabbing your dessert."His smile reached his eyes then, just for a moment. A flicker of light on dark water. Then he swung around and walked back up the sidewalk.I'm sure more people will love the book. There seems to be a ton of people on Amazon that love it already so there is that. Anyway, on to the next! Happy Reading! Mel ♥MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading ListAMAZON: REVIEW
