This book took me almost 4 months to read because every time I picked it up I just felt dread. That may be a bit harsh considering I really enjoyed the beginning of this book but I quickly found that it just was not what I expected or wanted. This was marketed as a fantasy so I was very confused when the fantastical elements didn't even come into the book until 2/3 of the way. If you're gonna sell me a fantasy you better deliver. I also was very uncomfortable with the way Finch, the only person of color, was treated. Alice the main character constantly refers to him as unattractive. And there is one scene in particular where they are stopped by a police officer whom Alice tries to provoke and Finch explains to her that it is dangerous for someone who looks like him to be disrespectful to cops and she just totally disregards and brushes him off. Problematic content aside, this book just wasn't for me. Maybe another type of reader could find enjoyment out of it but I was very disappointed.
