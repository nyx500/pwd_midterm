This book was AMAZING!! I haven't particularly read any fantasy books (other than repeatedly rereading Harry Potter) and it was refreshing to read this.This was my kind of fairytale- more of a Grimms fairytale than a Disney one. I loved the dark tones to this book and the darkness of the stories mentioned in "Tales of the Hinterland", the tales that are mentioned through out this book.This book enabled me to really develop my imagination. From creatures to the settings of dark dark woods. This book was also suspenseful and fast paced that I just did not want to put it down.I wish the author would write a book solely on the Tales of the Hinterland! I'd definitely buy it! I absolutely loved the main character- Alice Proserpine. She may sometimes be described as an "unlikeable" character but antiheroines are always my favourite. Overall this story was a great way to get me back into reading fantasy and fairy tale books. It is a book that I'm excited about rereading. I'm looking forward to reading future works by this author.
