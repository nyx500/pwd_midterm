This didn't pull me in as much as the Abhorsen Chronicles did from the very start, maybe because of the target audience being younger for this. I liked the sketch-style artwork included in the book, and the general "visual" aesthetics of the world Arthur is pulled into. The story as such is interesting enough and, at this point, nebulous enough, too, to make me want to continue the series in time, despite the lengthy passage here and there.
