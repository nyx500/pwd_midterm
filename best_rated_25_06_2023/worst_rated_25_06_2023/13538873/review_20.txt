This is not a review, it's a love letter.I adored this book. Why? It had a likeable narrator in Clay Jannon, a mysterious bookshop, romance, puzzles, secret societies, a San Francisco locale (with side trips to New York), and a sly sense of humor. The theme of Old Knowledge (books) vs. Internet knowledge gave the author the chance to slip in scenes at Google, a museum dedicated to knitting overrun by first graders, information about fonts, a character who made his fortune creating realistic 3-D versions of breasts, and a warehouse of artifacts that seemed a cross between what I imagine Amazon's warehouses to be and the warehouse from Raiders of the Lost Ark.The theme also allowed for scenes that reminded me of other books and movies, from Lord of the Rings, Canticle for Leibowitz, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Shadow of the Wind, and, strangely enough, O Brother Where Art Thou.There were so many parts of this book I wish I could quote here! But I will restrain myself and wait until it is published in October. Until then, I will content myself with recommending it enthusiastically. This book is  fun . It's the kind of book that made a reader of me, the kind of book that keeps me reading, the kind of book I can't wait to tell people about. So be prepared.
