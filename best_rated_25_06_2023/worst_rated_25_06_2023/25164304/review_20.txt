This was everything I wanted from it and more. A delight to read. I want to give it as gifts and peddle it to strangers. It warms my heart that this book is in the world for queer teen girls. Do you like Frozen but wish it was more gay? Of Fire and Stars. Perfect if you like fantasy or court politics or trying to find out who the betrayer is or magic or starcrossed lovers or grudging-friendship-turns-into-love or... Honestly, I just fell head over heels for this. All the best part of Tamora Pierce with twice the queer content. This reminds me of everything I wanted from Disney movies, but with added depth and maturity. (Maturity as in there is brief sexual content and swearing.) I can't wait to have a finished physical copy. I haven't swooned this hard for a book in years.
