Of Fire and Stars had the potential to be good as a YA fantasy with a lesbian romance, but it all fell pretty flat. Unfortunately, the execution didn’t hold up. There’s a huge lack of world-building and character development. And the biggest problem for me was how a lot of it just didn’t make sense. The plot doesn’t add up. Plus, the adult characters are all very stupid for some odd reason.Dennaleia, known as Denna, has been promised to the prince of Mynaria where magic is forbidden. But Denna has a secret she must keep or risk being killed. She has an affinity for fire and it seems to be harder to control since arriving in Mynaria. This should be problem enough until she forms a friendship with the prince’s sister Mare that soon grows into more.There are political situations among the kingdoms we’re thrown into where they all differ on their views of magic causing tension. There are groups unhappy about the alliance formed by Denna’s marriage. The issue here is there is no reason given for why Mynaria hates magic. So there isn’t any ground for these plot lines to stand on. There are times when the book feels really juvenile with very little logic to it. Scenes felt forced. The characters lacked depth. Denna and Mare’s relationship was confusing how it went from complete dislike, to friendship, to oh we’re definitely only friends. Other than the prince, I just don’t understand why in a world where homosexuality is openly accepted you would try to pass something off as friendship for so long.Alas, the execution could have been better.
