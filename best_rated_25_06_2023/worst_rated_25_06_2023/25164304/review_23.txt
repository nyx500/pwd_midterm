Honestly, more like Of Fire and Horses because the stars thing was just bad (and there are a lot of horses in this book).Despite seemingly the only sensible adult with a fully-functioning brain being killed way off in the beginning, I was invested in the book mainly because there was a subtlety to it all. However, as soon as the half mark hit, the book just escalated its pace and ended up falling flat. The political intrigue is laughable at best, the secondary characters get sidelined in favor of horses (and more horses), the plot opts for shock and awe and gets totally predictable in the process, the prince has the most ridiculous sounding name ever and is there to just do princely things. Lastly, I thought I actually liked the gendered world-building until I realized how pretty much all the royal women are not taken seriously at all and just no.I can go on, but I guess I should save the rest for the actual review.
