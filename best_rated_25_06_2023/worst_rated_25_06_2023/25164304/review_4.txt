DNF @ 31% I. CAN'T. DO. IT. ANYMORE. I. FUCKING CAN'T. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SLOWEST BOOKS WITH THE MOST BORING PLOT AND ABSOLUTELY SHITTY WORLD BUILDING. IT IS SO FUCKING SLOW, I LITERALLY AM WILLING TO READ FIFTY SHADES OVER THIS. I'VE BEEN READING THIS FOR ABOUT A MONTH. A FUCKING MONTH. I NEVER TAKE A FUCKING MONTH TO FINISH A 400 PAGE BOOK. I HAVE NO ENTHUSIASM TO READ THE WORDS WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK. I CANNOT FORCE MYSELF TO TURN ANOTHER PAGE BECAUSE IT IS SO FUCKING BORING. THE MAGIC ISN'T EXPLAINED. THE PLOT IS NOT CAPTIVATING. THE CHARACTERS AND WRITING IS SO SO DULL AND I CANNOT FIND A FUCK TO GIVE TO CONTINUE READING THIS. I AM BORED OUT OF MY MIND AND I'M DONE. It's pretty sad because this was such a cool concept. An f/f fantasy stand alone. But the plot was so fucking slow and excruciatingly boring srsly.
