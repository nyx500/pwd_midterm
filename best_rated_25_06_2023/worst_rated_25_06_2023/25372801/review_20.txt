All the Birds in the Sky is a very different book. Part science fiction and part fantasy, it also has a feel of magical realism. It follows the friendship of Patricia, a witch, and Laurence, a science genius, from middle school to adulthood.On the surface the story is about the collision of the worlds of magic and science set against the decline of both the natural world and society. Embedded in that context is the more personal story of friendship and love, what that means, and how it can take time to truly appreciate. The writing is very fresh and the tale is skillfully told by Anders as she makes these characters come to life. This probably isn't a book for everyone, but I loved every minute of it.
