Well that was a surprise! A pleasant one though. Once I had adjusted to the talking birds and realised there was much more fantasy in the book than science fiction, I settled down to enjoy what I found to be an excellent story.Laurence and Patricia made a beautiful pair, especially once they had left home and school. What an awful school that was! The assassin/school counsellor reminded me of Terry Pratchett's books. He was very fond of his school for assassins and the amazing things they could do. They nearly always came to sticky ends too.I suppose there was a lot of fairly profound stuff I could comment on about nature versus science and the future of our planet but I was mostly interested in Patricia's amazing witchy skills and her relationship with Laurence. I was so absorbed in what was happening between them at the end that I totally missed the surrounding events (little things like war and the future of the Earth) and had to go back and read the last chapter again.Having read it twice I can state that it is a satisfactory ending on all accounts and an excellent finale to a very entertaining book.
