So, since this got a bunch of good reviews, I decided to pick this up. Just my luck that Target would have autographed first editions of it:The basic premise of this book is that the main characters here are the background players in everything else. The funny thing is that this story, while YA, makes fun of YA tropes and bloated subgenres like vampires or demigods or immortals and kids "dying beautifully of cancer". That's the whole joke about this book is that it's poking fun at how airheaded YA culture can be sometimes, how teens can mindlessly go after the next big thing and turn it into a plague that destroys their brain cells while parents pretend it isn't happening.It's as if the camera were to pan away from Bella and Edward and start following Anna Kendrick and all of the other nobody characters (but without all of the tryhardness of IRL Anna Kendrick that gets really obnoxious). The Rest of Us Just Live Here is about the people who have to watch from the sidelines and are never part of the larger story, which is probably why this book is very popular: it speaks to all the people who weren't popular in school.
