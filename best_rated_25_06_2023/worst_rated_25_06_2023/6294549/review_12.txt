3.5/ 4ishI really missed a good UF!I admit, it took me a bit to get into the story. But well, once I got there, I couldn't get out!I absolutely loved it! Loved the world it created and the characters, even the "case" was a damn interesting one (and that's not very easy to find).This series has a lot of potential, can't wait to get to the next one!
