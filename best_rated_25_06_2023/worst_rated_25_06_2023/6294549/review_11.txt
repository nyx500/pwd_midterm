This was a tough book for me because I kept falling asleep every time I tried to read it. I swear, it was like a giant Xanax.30 minutes of the endless descriptions and the politics of every single fae creature will do that too.Plus, on top of the endless descriptions and explanations, October/Toby was weak as hell. She was injured the entire book. By the end of it, she is dragging her half-dead, bleeding corpse around to fight monsters way bigger than her, but she still refuses to shoot first. Seriously, there was one scene when she just needed to shoot the freaking gun that was in her hand to stop everything, but she hesitates and ends up getting someone else killed and herself even more injured- if that were possible. She just stands there, talking to the bad guy who says he is going to kill her. Bitch, shoot him!!It was frustrating!Look, I live in Texas. We shoot first and ask questions later. This woman got on my last nerve.On the good side - the world was interesting. There were a hella lotta fae running around. Plus, there were even two cats I liked - the thornbush cat, and the king of the cats dude. He was interesting and hot, but there wasn't enough of him to keep me awake.All in all - good book if you have insomnia.
