Not sure if I loved this so much because I was in the perfect mood for fantasy, or because I've had a month of low rated reads, but I soaked this up! I'm sad that I gave away my physical copy based on the book jacket synopsis. Reasons you might like this:-elemental magic - fire, ice, light, darkness-enemies to love with lots of banter and softness-a competition (but it's not too big a part of the plot)-a morally gray heroine that might be a prophesied villain (!!!)Anyway, just throw the other 2 books my way, I'm gonna blaze through this series.Audiobook review: 4 star narration. The narrator had a very pleasant voice to listen to and I had no problems with the voicing or emotion.
