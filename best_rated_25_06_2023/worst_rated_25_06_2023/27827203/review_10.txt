3.5 StarsThis is one of those books I really wanted to love, but it just kept coming up short.If you're a fan of fantasy or YA, frostblood offers nothing new. To me, it just felt like a mix of different plots that has already been done before.With that said, I will read the sequel, because I've heard it's a step up from the first- and because I genuienly like her characters and world.Edited 24.12.17 due to spelling errors.
