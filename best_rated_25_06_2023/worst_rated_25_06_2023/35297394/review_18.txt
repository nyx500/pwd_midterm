Dark, delectable and atmospheric.  “We wait for death. We hold our breath. We know it’s coming, and still we flinch when it claws at our throats and pulls us under.” Penny lives in the town of Sparrow, Oregon, a town that has been under a curse for the last 200 years. 3 teenage girls were drowned for the crime of witchcraft. Since then the 3 sisters return every summer to claim the lives of teenage boys as revenge for the way the town treated them. They inhabit the bodies of local girls on the first day of the Swan Season and over the next few weeks the bodies of boys will be found drowned and washed up on the shore. When Penny meets Bo, a mysterious traveller who seems to never have heard of the Swan sisters and everything weird that happens in Sparrow she gives him a job and invites him to live in the cottage on the island she lives with her mother. Her mother has lost her mind ever since Penny’s father disappeared. As bodies begin to appear and everyone is determined to work out which girls have been taken over by the swan sisters and to stop them the island becomes a very dangerous place. This was a wonderful read full of dark magic and secrets. Once again I found the insta love too much but that’s just me and YA. Highly recommend.  “Because they don’t inhabit bodies just to be alive again; they do it for revenge.” “Revenge on who?” “The town.”
