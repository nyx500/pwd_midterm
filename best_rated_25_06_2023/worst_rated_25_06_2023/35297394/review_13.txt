I never thought I would love this book that much!❤️I can still feel the salty air of the coastal town of Sparrow on my skin and imagine swimming in the cold ocean by night.🌊 I loved this atmospheric story, its eerie setting and the spooky legend of the three sisters sentenced to death two centuries ago. Witches, curse, disappearance, ghosts, possession and revenge... If these words appeal to you, read this book! You're even gonna get a great twist (I saw it coming, but it was still terrific!). Without a doubt, this book intrigued me and captivated me from the start.4.5 rounded up
