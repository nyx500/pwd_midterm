Wickedly Witchy!I enjoyed this book. It did sort of remind me of Hocus Pocus (which I love), but for a much more mature audience. The focus on three witches put to death over two hundred years ago and returning due to a curse is the common theme between the two, but this book differs from there with actual deaths, plot twists and a few unexpected surprises.
