This book had an excellent concept which as soon as i read, intrigued and enthused me, however in execution, this one fell flat for me.It wasn't  bad  per say, but its been 2 months since i read The Wicked Deep and i could honestly not tell you any of the characters names or half of what actually happened in the story. Also has some weird notions when it comes to consent toward the end which made me feel, well.. icky.
