Ever since I finished Tithe I've wanted to finish this series.. but never seemed to try and read the second book. No idea why, maybe I'm super lazy or I just never got the book.. but I'm happy to redeem myself people. It follows Val Russell, who is about 17 years old, and she have a terrible life. Her family sucked a bag of dicks and her whole life spiraled down a dark ass rabbit hole. Yeah, things were not sunny on her side of the street. The grass was not greener for her. Well, her life sort of gets better when she finds herself within a homeless crowd. From this, she meets Dave, Lolli, and Luis. Things don't always go according to plan when Val is involved which is probably why this book was so entertaining. I wouldn't necessarily say it was a page turner from start to finish - because I did get bored while reading this. Speaking of the people she meets, Lolli, man, she was so freaking weird! That whole killing a cat just because she didn't want to take care of it .. man, it gave me the shivers. I cringed so hard. I don't even like cats that much and I would never do that. AND I'M ALLERGIC TO THEM BITCHES! Besides that, things happened in this book that kind of shocked me a little bit. Overall, it was an interesting book that I'm kind of happy that I dove into. I'm super happy that I dove back into this series and I can't wait to dive into the next book of this one. I hope it's not as creepy or cringe-worthy as this one.. but I'll still probably read it.
