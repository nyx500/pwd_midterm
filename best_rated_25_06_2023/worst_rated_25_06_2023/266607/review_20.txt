I was a bit disappointed when Valiant didn't start up where Tithe ended. However, I quickly got over it. This story follows 17-year-old Val Russell who runs away from her dysfunctional home within the first few chapters. In a moment of shedding her confusion, she embraces a new identity and shaves her head, leaving everything behind. She also finds herself in the company of three homeless teens--Lolli, Dave, and Luis who live on an abandoned subway platform.Eerie and strange, Val finds herself caught in the web of drugs she's never seen, and a life she never imagined. Luis is severe, blind in one eye, and pierced with iron. He also wears the role of protector for both Lolli and Dave. He's none too happy to find Val among them. Dave is the younger brother who mistakenly takes Val on a delivery her first morning with the trio. With him, she finds the web of glamour that will keep her from ever seeing anything the same way again.Under the blanket of the world of faerie, she finds someone to stand up for and takes control of her future. I can't wait for Ironside which picks up Roiben and Kaye's continuing story.
