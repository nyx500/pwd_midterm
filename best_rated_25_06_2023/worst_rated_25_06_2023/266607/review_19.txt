3 starsFor my thoughts on book one, Tithe, see this review. My reviews for this series are reaction reviews, so please check the title page for a description. This is such an interesting series to me. Not necessarily because of the strength of the plots or storytelling, but because it's an almost near-perfect excavation of a very particular YA trope niche in the mid-2000s. After Tithe, this was an odd second novel - it follows a completely different set of characters and tackles different themes. In particular, teenage runaways, homelessness, drug use, and faerie politics. To name a few. Because of those harder themes and lack of connection to Tithe, I have to admit I didn't enjoy this novel as much as the first one DESPITE it having a stronger plot, better pacing, and more logical scene transitions. (I'm not a fan of reading/watching/witnessing hardcore drug use due to personal reasons, so that was definitely a me thing and not the fault of the book.) However, what brought this novel up to three stars was its stellar ending sequence. The last 15% of this was awesome, and had all of the best elements of urban/speculative faerie fantasies with a dark twist. Really interesting to see Holly Black continue to explore the threads of faerie culture that she hones in later series, and in this book in particular, I also see some similarities in theme and tone to one of her other books, The Coldest Girl in Coldtown.
