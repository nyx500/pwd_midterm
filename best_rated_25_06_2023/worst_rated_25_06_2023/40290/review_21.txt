**Spoilers, not much though**Nothing about this book really wow’d me or stood out enough for me to say “here friend, you’d love this book,” The selling feature of this book to me was that it was written by Orson Scott Card, which only makes the fact that it didn’t do anything for me all the more disappointing. I loved the Ender Series he wrote. I normally pick up any book by him I can find but living in my small town the book store isn’t normally stocked with much of anything but Ender’s Game. When I found this series, and for pretty cheap, I picked them all up. The writing, the style, the characters, none of them spoke to me in a way they did in Card’s other novels. When Alvin was coming into his powers or lying on his death bed I couldn’t care less about the ending. Some of the sentences are oddly constructed and can be hard to follow when you’re just trying to get in a few quick pages. The characters weren’t very ‘connectable’ and the Unmaker doesn’t even feel like a problem to me either. Very little happens and you get very little out of this book. I wouldn’t really recommend this to anyone except for Orson Scott Card fans who just want to get his whole collection of works. I’ll continue to read this series and hope it picks up but if you’re looking for a thrilling fantasy book (or even an interesting book) this isn’t the place to look.
