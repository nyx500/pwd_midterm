A BR with Lily!Sadly DNF @ page 150I almost finished day 2 but I can't continue this book, let alone a whole trilogy!I had one thought while reading this: that it sounded like it was written by an accountant. Guess what? It is! I came here to check the author, only to find out that she has an M.A degree in accountancy and a Bachelors of Arts in English Literature.You know that I like to support new and trending authors but the writing style just is not for me, if you are like me and read this because you heard it is like SoC then don't because they are nothing alike!Also my friend Lola wrote in her review that this Sin City is Las Vegas and not something new and I couldn't agree more.P.S: the author used the term "Cocky" in page 142, that is illegal, right?(Faleena hopkins must be proud of me!)
