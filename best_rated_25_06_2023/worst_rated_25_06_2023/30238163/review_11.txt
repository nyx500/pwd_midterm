The reviews put me off reading this book at first and now I’m so frustrated because I’ve been denying myself such a good book for ages!!! This was so unexpectedly good! A prim and proper finishing school girl meets a rough and ambitious street lord and I SHIP IT SO MUCH! I loved the 1920s Las Vegas-esque setting and the magic system and ahhh so good!I can’t wait to jump into book two. If anyone fears it being a Six of Crows knockoff - as the other reviews claim - have no fear. There aren’t really any similarities AT ALL. If anything, this has some similarities to Caraval with a magical game atmosphere.
