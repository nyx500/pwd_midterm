2.5 STARSNo one is more disappointed than I am that this rating is anything less than 5 STARS. I went in wholly expecting to adore this story; the cover is gorgeous and the comparisons to Six Of Crows had me cautiously fangirling over this book from the moment I knew of it's existence. Throw in the fact that I absolutely loved Daughter Of The Burning City last year and I was completely sold. Unfortunately, this one just didn't work for me. I'm not here to deter anyone from picking this up, as I think the main reason I didn't enjoy this was purely based on reading preferences and nothing actually harmful from the book itself. Ace Of Shades has some awesome representation and an intriguing premise, but I think maybe I was a little too old to appreciate this level of YA. In fact, even though some of the content was slightly unsettling, I think the younger side of YA may enjoy this more than those closer to the NA age. The language used felt on the immature side, and I just found myself constantly zoning out or dozing off while reading this. I was bored.  There, I said it. Again, I definitely think this is just a matter of opinion and I genuinely wish any and all readers more success with this book than I had. Review copy furnished by the publisher.
