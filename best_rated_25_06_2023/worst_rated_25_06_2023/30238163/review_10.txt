Fun fact about me: I need to stop reading books solely because they’re compared to Six of Crows.It invariably results in disappointment.Honestly I think it’d be fairer for publishers to stop comparing every. Single. Dark YA fantasy to Six of Crows, but APPARENTLY that’s not going to happen so. Looks like the responsibility lies on me.My life is so hard.BUT THIS BOOK IS COMPLETELY A KNOCKOFF OF SIX OF CROWS.(Emphasis on the word knockoff.)This is a dark YA fantasy where a ragtag crew of diverse teens live in a Fantastical City Of Magic and Crime and there are gangs and casinos (our male protagonist is even a gang leader, for god’s sake - even his NAME, Levi Glaisyer, sounds like Kaz Brekker) and Good Girls Gone Bad (OUR FEMALE PROTAGONIST IS A SNEAKY DANCER) and heists and thievery and general Planning.That, my friend, is the exact same concept as Six of Crows. You can’t fool me.Except Ace of Shades is SoC but minus the excitement and banter and lovable characters and fun and Planning Action Montages and good quality world-building and magic.So what is all of that replaced with, you might ask?Well, I live to suffer, so this shouldn’t surprise you.It’s STUPID, INSTA-LOVE-Y ROMANCE.And I hate it with my life. I am not here to read about how cute Levi Glaisyer thinks Enne Salta’s cookie addiction is. If I wanted to read about a girl thinking about little else besides cookies, I could read anything I’ve ever written.I WAS HERE FOR MAGIC AND DARKNESS AND ACTION. NOT OVERPROTECTIVENESS AND TWO TEENS MAKING PUPPY DOG EYES AT EACH OTHER.Plus, as if the gross love and the general this-is-a-worse-version-of-Six-of-Crows feeling that pervades were not enough. THERE IS MORE.The world-building is really weird and...bad? It has nothing to offer that a million other YA fantasy worlds don’t, minus the fact that it was sloppily done and I still don’t really get it. (What the hell is a Mizer? Why are there different types of Talent? Why is there so much political history if I still don’t understand any of it or really why it matters?)And the fun of Kaz Brekker as a character is that he manages to be both human and very, very good at what he does. Levi Glaisyer is...not. He is, in fact, a very terrible crime lord. I feel that if I were suddenly shoved into the streets of the City of Sin (which, sure, just steal the nickname for an existing real life city because who even cares at this point), I would make a better gang leader than this lil boy.It’s a low bar for success.Similarly, Enne is no fun to read about, because she spends the whole book being prim and proper and completely f*cking stupid and then suddenly transforms into...not very proper but still unbelievably dumb? Levi has to save her all the time, but he’s also a total dumbass so then Enne has to save him, but she’s also still dumb so then she needs to be rescued, and the whole thing ends up like an Abbott and Costello routine except with who’s dumber.The only thing worse than a damsel in distress is TWO damsels in distress.And also the damsels are in stupid, boring, uninteresting, unwanted love.Bottom line: This was so completely un-fun it was astonishing.----------pre-review*picture me standing on some rooftops, absolutely screaming*WHEN I PICK UP AN ADVENTUROUS ACTION-PACKED BOOK ABOUT A DARK CITY AND SOME TEENAGE CRIMINALS...I AM NOT, REPEAT NOT, LOOKING FOR A WILL THEY/WON'T THEY ROMANCE.review to come / 1.5 stars----------i will read literally anything that's supposed to be like six of crows
