I really do not think the audiobook is the way to go with this one, which is the format I read this in. I was excited for the premise about mermaids who are created from the African slaves that were thrown overboard during the slave trade. The premise was so unique and interesting. There was one character who held all of the memories of her race and discussed how much of a burden that job was. However, the story itself was really hard to get into and the plot jumped around and was hard for me to follow. I wasn't sure what the purpose really was or where anything was going. I wish there was more of a narrative and a story. There was a lot packed in here, but as a complete story, it did not hold my attention or make me want to keep reading.
