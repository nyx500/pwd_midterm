3.5 starsThis was a really interesting/upsetting/disturbing/wonderful premise - all the pregnant women that were held in slavery on ships and tossed overboard to drown, their babies were kept alive by the ocean by turning them into a new race of mermaid-like people. This new species then develops a culture that focuses on letting go of their past. In fact, they have a designated person, the historian, who is responsible for holding their memories/history, and that person is the protagonist of the story. It's a lot to think about. However, I am not sure the actual storytelling was quite as enthralling as the idea of the story, but it's still worth a read/listen.
