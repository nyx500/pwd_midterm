Giveaway win!5 Stars isn't enough! Water dwelling creatures who are the descendants of African slave women. How could I not read this book. The Deep is filled with flowery poetic language that I normally hate. Flowery language often comes off sounding pretentious and it usually leaves me rolling my eyes. But that flowery type of language fits The Deep just perfectly. The Deep is a modern day take on African folklore. The same folklore that was brought to America on slave ships and passed down to each new generation. The Deep is strangely beautiful and a strikingly impactful story of coming to terms with the savage and barbaric history of slavery and the ability to move past that and find inner peace. A MUST MUST MUST READ!
