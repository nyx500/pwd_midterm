Wow, talk about going into a book expecting to be bored as fuck and trashing the shit out of it....and then coming out screaming and loving the crap out of it and screaming so much BECAUSE AHAHAHAHA this was great.So, I've read The Hunger's Game, but never once, did it occur to me, that THIS BOOK, is literally just like that book. Not once did I compare it even though IT IS SIMILAR. There's just something so???? original and captivating about this book and it was so fun!!! It wasn't until afterwards I read someone's review that I saw them point out the similarities between both books and then the realization hit me. Honestly, I can see why many people find this book boring and that's because there is no action and nothing exciting in this book. I wouldn't call it slow paced either because I flew through this beauty. And slow paced book never work out for me. Don't go into this book expecting too much badass action or cool magic because you will not get that. I recommend diving straight into this book knowing nothing because I did that and it worked out great. Many of my friends hated this and thought it was boring. I never bothered to check what this book was about and just started reading with my lowest expectations and I WAS SO SURPRISED BY HOW MUCH I LOVED IT!Pasha is literally like Rhy. He reminded me so much of him. They both are heir to the throne. They are charming, flirty, funny, witty and so loveable. AND I KIND OF SHIP HIM WITH VIKA LMAO, IT'S GONNA SINK ISN'T IT????Nikolai is serious, hot, serious, hot, and quiet. Kind of reminds me of Zuko without the anger. Vika is a badass and strong character and I really liked her. The love triangle can choke.Initial reaction:WHAT THE HECK SOMEONE THROW THE NEXT BOOK IN MY FACE, I LOVED THIS. WOW. BYE. IM DECEASED.I DONT KNOW IF I SHOULD GIVE THIS 4 OR 5 STARS SO RATING AND REVIEW TO COME.
