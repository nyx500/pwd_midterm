The CW is developing this book and it's time to get excited!!! Not only does this book sound awesome but it's going to (maybe-potentially) be on TV! And I just really want to see Dorothy die. Is that too much? ;) ----UPDATE: 4/1/14So good!!! Lots of action and twists that I didn't see coming. One of the most brutal and violent YA books I've ever read, which just makes it that much more epic since it's set in Oz. And Danielle Paige knows her L. Frank Baum. I've read probably 10+ books about Oz and I was so impressed how she wove his world into hers, making it unique but still stayed true to the original. Loved how she brought up all the specific countries in Oz. Plus, super cool points for the Patchwork Girl shout out! Definite 5 Star read. Now all that's left is a long wait for the sequel. Oh, and apparently the CW passed on the script and didn't pick it up for a pilot. Which is beyond stupid! This would have been a fantastic TV show. Excuse me while I mourn what could have been...
