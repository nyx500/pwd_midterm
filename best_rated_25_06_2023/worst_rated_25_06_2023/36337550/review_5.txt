I really can't express how much I hated this book. It felt like I was taken in, because it promises a lot up front, but it does not deliver. Too many characters, too much going back and forth between the same scenes with no clear road map made my head hurt. 512 pages of confusing gibberish later I thought there might be a stunning conclusion to wrap it all up neatly, no, that was way too much to hope for. Many of my smart Goodreads friends did not finish this, I wish I could have been among them.
