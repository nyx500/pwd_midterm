Well, yikes.Here are the things I knew about this book before starting it:1) Its original title (and current UK title) was The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, which, in pure coincidence, is very very similar to The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, and was therefore changed in the US. (I think this is awesome.)2) It’s a murder mystery with quite possibly the coolest conceit of any book ever. (I think this is awesome.)3) It’s teeming with gratuitous fat shaming. (I think this is one of the less awesome things I've ever heard in my life.)Add to that list that the style is extremely overbearing and unyielding over the course of 480 pages (which feels like many more), and you have my list of major takeaways from this reading experience.Let’s go in order.NUMBER 1: TITLE THINGWell, we basically already covered this.But it says a lot that I still think this is the most interesting thing about this book, and it has nothing to do with its contents.NUMBER 2: PLOT THINGThe idea for this book is SO COOL. Which is why it’s extra lame that I found the first 300-ish pages to be very, very boring, and also found the Big Reveal to be - while not predictable - also boring, and generally speaking was very bored by this whole thing.Also, the fact that the conceit of this book is what it is (meaning, a guy wakes up in a different person’s body every day with the task of solving the murder of Evelyn Hardcastle) means there must be Magic involved.Cool! Who doesn’t love magic?Um, apparently this author, because this Magical World goes largely unexplained and then is halfheartedly told at one point but is clearly not the Main Issue.Which is extra, extra lame.NUMBER 3: FATPHOBIA THINGReading this author say that he did not intend to shame fat people in this book is the stupidest, dumbest, most useless excuse for blatant hatred I’ve ever heard.It’s actually worse if the fat shaming in this book is not intended, because the idea that someone could go around subliminally thinking things as hateful as this is absurd. The way the fat character in this is written - traitless but for the fact that he is very fat, and therefore lonely and abhorrent and disgusting - is so awful. It’s to the point of being basically unreadable.This book got better towards the end, but I still wish I had DNFed it at this point.NUMBER 4: STYLE THINGI could tell within a couple dozen pages that this style - extremely overwrought, extremely overbearing, and extremely present for the whole book - was not going to work for me.It never did.Bottom line: The only cool thing about this book was the idea behind it, and everything about the execution was a major bummer.-------------pre-reviewwell, i didn't hate this as much as i expected.what a rave review.rtc / 2 stars-------------42 pages into this and already brutally sick of the style. YET ANOTHER PROMISING READING EXPERIENCE
