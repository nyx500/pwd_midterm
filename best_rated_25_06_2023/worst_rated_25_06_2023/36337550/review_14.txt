Holy crap on a cracker! First chapter and I’m in crazy town! Well. That went downhill fast! I’m totally in the minority here! I usually love this kind of strange book. But I had to slog through this book. Seriously, I need to start dnfing because time is precious! Sigh!! I’m happy for almost ALL of my friends that loved this!! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
