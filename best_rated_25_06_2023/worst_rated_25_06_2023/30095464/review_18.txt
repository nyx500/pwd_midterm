Snapped up the audio version for my first OverDrive adventure to participate in the NicNax Book Club Backlist Readalong hosted on bookstagram by the amazing Tasha...how she manages to organise such awesome readlongs at the same time as the fab fun BookBingo is a mystery to me 🤩I had such fun sharing thoughts and ideas with the group and we're continuing straight on with the sequel, because this ends in an interesting place with tasty tidbits and hints still to be unravelled.Told in an alternating timeline, we meet our MC when she's a girl & learn her story as she peels back the layers sharing her tale with a Bard while working in isolation on an intriguing project. The "results" of this project are so interesting to me! (Spoiler free enough to pique anyone's interest? Lolz 🤗)The audio version distinguished the timelines really well having a male narrator for the Bard scenes and the female narrator was really fun to listen to especially her accents even if Parmina was hard on the ears at times...it's supposed to be 😂I really enjoyed the magic system and the world established in this YA series opener, even if at times the different lands and cultures could be a little awkward to remember because their intros could be a little info'dumpy - but I think this could be because I was listening to the audio, may have been multitasking and thus confused easier 🤷‍♀️The Asha remind me of magical Geisha and the gifted men of this world join the Deathseekers dictated by what the characters heartglass reveal around their 13th birthdays. I had hoped for more of a magical school/lessons setting and part of my niggles with this read is how much we're told vs shown. As with many first books in series there is a lot to fill the reader in on and for how beautiful this world sounds the reading experience was very description heavy especially the clothing & food (I was having GoT foody flashbacks) any action felt rather spaced out 😅However I would love to see this adapted for the screen as it sounds visually stunning! Especially the way the magic is layered into the clothes and jewels - fascinating!I enjoyed the characters and most particularly the relationship between the MC and her familiar brother - what a way to maintain a special bond! 😈I like the blossoming sisterhood and the way these characters give us glimpses into the many magics of the Asha.Being a more unique Dark Asha/Bone Witch made our MC a little "not-like-other-girls" but this tends to be par for the course in YA - I am surprisingly more curious about necromancy type magic than I thought I would be & find myself eyeing the Gideon the Ninth series a little more seriously now lolzI'm not overly fond of the hinted at love geometry - but seeing as it appears my preferred ship should sail I shall wait and see how that may come about before casting too harsh a judgment on the shapes...yup guess I'm peak hypocritical 😇The ending felt a little out of left field for me as if there were any hints as to its possibility earlier in the book I mostly missed them - those seeds were well hidden! However as mentioned above and below it does leave the door open with interesting options for what happens between our timelines and I am curious to see how they join up 😆3.25-3.5*YA tends to be a little too surface level for me these days & I struggle a bit with the characters ages and how adult they sometimes feel...just make them older. Aged 18 to early 20s they can still make rash decisions and juvenile mistakes without making 14-17year olds act more adult than I do 🤔In saying this I did enjoy my time in the world and am plenty curious to see what comes next 😎
