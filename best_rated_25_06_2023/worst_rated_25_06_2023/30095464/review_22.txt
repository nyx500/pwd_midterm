(I received an advance copy of this book for free. Thanks to SOURCEBOOKS Fire and NetGalley.)"This is death magic, complicated and exclusive and implacable, and from the start, I wielded it with ease."This was a YA fantasy story, about a girl with the power of necromancy. Tea was quite a strong character, and I liked how she wasn't afraid to stand up and act when the situation called for it. I also found the way she discovered her powers (by raising her brother from the dead), to be pretty awesome.The storyline in this was quite slow, and mainly dealt with Tea leaving her family to go and train with another bone witch/Dark Asha, and it wasn't until right at the end of the book that we got a bit of action in the form of a 'daeva' - some kind of monster, which Tea had to go up against. The slow pace leading up to this point started to bother me though, and it felt like the book had no real plot other than describing Tea's training and clothing. The ending to this did have a little more action, but I have to admit to being a bit confused as to what really happened.6.5 out of 10
