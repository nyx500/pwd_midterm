4.5 stars. I have found over the years that statements like "nothing happens" really didn't mean much and I started ignoring them more and more when reading reviews. The Bone Witch is yet again proof that as far as I'm concerned as a reader, I was right to do so. Indeed I personally love training/getting to know their powers/their new world plots, and in that aspect this book certainly deliveredâ€”as a result, I was never bored. Now, we can philosophy away on what we mean by "nothing" when we write this in reviews (I, too, wrote these 2 words on occasion for sure) but at the end of the day, what matters most is the ability to captivate us. So. Did The Bone Witch succeed in this endeavor? Absolutely. The writing is compelling, the world fascinating and I really liked Tea, the main character. The two timelines structure is something I used to be wary of but learned to love, when it's used as a way to increase the tension especially, as it was done here. As for the romance, there's none in this first book but I did what I always do when I know a love triangle is a possibility : I asked a friend to let me know (only the relationship part). Let it be clear however that this information is not needed at all to enjoy this bookâ€”as I said, there's no romance in this bookâ€”I just have trust issues okay? ðŸ™ˆI'm so excited about reading the sequels.CW: graphic violence, blood, gore, death, warPS. Just a thought, but I would have done without the french slur s***** used here. I hate this word with passion and it took me by surprise â€”and not in a good wayâ€” both times it was uttered. I'm sureâ€”I knowâ€”that there are other swear words in french that could have conveyed the same meaning without resorting to that very sexist one.
