~before review~my strange and violent self seeing the cover: just squeeze a liiiiitle more~after review~woah. that last line gave me chills. anyway, i thought that it was pretty good (though i am disappointed because there wasn’t really any big plot twists) but for the last seventy pages, i have no idea what happened. there was like a serpent or something and then people were fighting, it was just a lot packed into seventy pagesgood things:-i liked Sorasa a lot-i thought that the world building was pretty good and the map was so pretty -nobody super important dies so thanks Aveyard for sparing me the pain-Erida was so cool-there’s a lot of things i haven’t listed just because i don’t remember-I JUST FOUND OUT THAT ERIDA IS BI AND I’m SO HAPPY
