“Hammer and nail, the Companions are now seven, wind and gail, bound for hell or bound for heaven.”⭐⭐⭐⭐.5 starsThis was my most anticipated release of 2021I counted each and every day until the releaseAND MY DEAR BOOKWORMS, IT WAS WORTH IT🥺The first thing I would like to say is that this book is not something everyone will like. Most will find it very slow-paced or boring.But I will tell youThis is a slow-paced masterpiece 🥺Sure the first 2 chapters are infodump-o-topia, but after that, it's extremely interesting and the characters omg my heart flutters at the thought of them!This book is extremely diverse and shockingly different from most YA books. While most books rely on romance, angst, fast-paced scenes and not like other girls this book is everything against itThere is like very minimal romance and that is VILLAIN ON VILLAIN ROMANCE ADSKJLAJFUSHF And it is also VERY different from Red Queen. If u know me, u know that I'm a sucker for Red Queen books, so it might be surprising so as to why I like thisWell, it has all the good components of Red Queen.*We have a FARLEY or rather 2 FARLEYSS*We have a MAVEN*We have an EVANGELINEAlso, this doesn't have the unnecessary angst from Red queen(even tho I enjoyed it)NO LOVE TRIANGLE EEEKDo I need to convince u further?And the magic system in this book ah omg so good! The concept of spindles, spindle blood etc...was something I really enjoyed.Sure, I was confused as hell but it was a good kind of confused“There are no greater teachers than fear and pain.”Also not everyone in these books are teenagers. Becasue as we all know, its impossible for teenagers alone to save the world. I loved that accept!Corayne and Erida and Andry and are teenagersSorasa and Sigil are in their late 20'sTaristan and Doma re 500+ aged immortalsValtik is an OLD witchI LOVED ITPlotI just cannot explain it. Ugh I have been sitting here for half-hour wondering how to describe the plot in my own words or whatever bcz my words cannot do justice to the plot.Even the blurb cannot do justice!Um....um....Okay, so Corayne is the daughter of a pirate. The pirate is not just some pirate but a very dangerous one. She pleads with her mom to let her go on the ships, but her mom refuses.“My love, you don’t know what you’re asking for.” Corayne narrowed her black eyes. “Oh, I think I do.”After her mom leaves she is sad bcz she has spent nearly all her life wanting to sail. But then something shocking happens. An immortal and an assassin come to meet herGasp, she's the only living descendant of a previously dead lineGasp, she has to save the Realm from some very evil hoomans or rather immortalsGasp, no that's all for gaspsShe cannot do it alone. She needs help. And that is when the rest of the crew joins.Gasp, they are awesome!Together they have to fight against some very evil not so evil *side glances at Taristan* immortal to secure their realm and make sure What Waits(evil thingy) always remains waiting and not planning on visiting.Forgive my very mediocre explanationWriting“Only men can speak all day long and still think themselves silent.”“I don’t belong anywhere,” Corayne said, her voice failing. To her surprise, Sorasa cracked a smile. “There are plenty of people like that,” she said. “And nowhere is still a somewhere.”My stupid self forgot to mark quotes while reading because I was too into the story*punches self*But anyways I loved it! I saw soo much change in her writing style and 3rd POV suits her better than 1st POV.The only problem I had was the info dumps at the starting and hence the 0.5 stars reductionBut anyways, I loved it! Did I say I loved it?I LOVED ITWorld buildingThe World is literally the most important thing in Fantasy and gotta say this didn't disappoint!The whole concept of Spindle blood, Spindle swords was soo creative and omg so good.Sure, it was confusing but once i ~kinda~ understood everything I had soo much fun! ANd Im thinking the author is gng to introduce some alternate universe monsters in the next bookIM READY> IM FREAKING READY.The magic was complex and yet soo simple. I loved it sm ahhhhhhhhhhhhhCharactersOk there are soo many characters I wanna talk about!There are 9 characters u should know abt...They are the MC's!* Corayne the map obsessed gal*Dom the cinnamon roll immortal*Sorasa the badass assassin*Andry the very cute squire*Sigil the very awesome bounty hunter*Charlon the very funny forger*Valtik the witchy witch*Erida the very gray queen*Taristan the cute evil guy<3But Im going to talk about only some of them Corayne“This is the best way out of here. To the horizon and beyond it. To whoever I am, in my bones.”To those people out there who call Corayne boring..WTF IS WRONG WITH U?Just because she is not like other YA MC's doesn't mean she is boring! Unlike almost every Ya MC, she doesn't know how to fight. She cant handle a sword. She is intellectually clever. She knows how to handle a map and can solve riddles. She likes pretty things *cough*Andry*cough*She is sassy strong and brave.She is the definition of "bravery doesn't lie in one's abilities to fight"She lets others help her unlike some *cough*Mare*cough*. Corayne will listen to ur advice and interpret it in her own way. She is always ready to learn and that scene when Sorasa teaches her to fightADSKJLBCHACIUBCHSBIASVFNVUI ADORE HER OMG.Even though she can't fight with swords, she is clever and makes plans<3I LOVE HER.Sorasa“Boys do stupid things to feel like men, no matter how old they are.”SorasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaSHE IS THE FREAKING FARLEY I WAS TALKING ABOUT EEEEKSorasa omg the first chapter I read from her POV, I was blown away. She murdered someone then*excitedly jumps*Sorasa is an assassin. Unfortunate conditions have led to that. She is brave and very strong. She can kill you in 50 different ways. She is sassy and takes no hate.She saves everyone's ass almost every time and she does it with style. You know u can always rely on Sorasa to save you.ALSO, SHE AINT A TEENAGER SHE IS IN HER LATE 20'sHow often do u see grown-up characters in books??I LOVE HER AHHHHH“Sorasa spat heartily, her aim true.”Mare Barrow who?Hey, but Sorasa is nothing like the lightning girl[image error]*panics because I don't have enough space in the review*Im going to try and keep everything shortErida“Only men can speak all day long and still think themselves silent.”Erida my very morally grey Queen. No, she is literally a queen. Until that very particular plot twist I liked her, but not much.But after that OMG SHe HAS BECOME MY FAV CHARCTEREveryone meet my book gf💖💖, Erida the queen of......(I forgot I'm sorry)SHE IS MINEEE*may contain spoilers*Erida is the Evangeline of this story.Erida is the queen of...... She is not evil but an opportunist. She knows she has to keep her kingdom safe so she agrees to Taristan.She sacrifices her happiness for that. She will do anything for her kingdom<3AND I LOVE HERI REALLY DO. Im ah so excited to see her in the next book eeeeekThe next few characters I'm going to talk very little about. Though I love them, I actually have no idea what to say about them and how to express my love for themTaristanEvil, Cruel and the Villain. But I like him. Why?I don't know he is soo interesting to read and omg his twisted brain💖💖“You are a realm breaker, Taristan. You would crack this world apart and build an empire from its ruins.”Dom is supposed to be an cruel immortal. But omg he is soo innocent and cute. I soo respect the author for reversing the gender roles for making the Female characters strong and the fighters and making the guys very cute and cinnamon rollishHey but if u cross Dom, he will tear u apart into pieces :) Andry omg! Most times I have to remind myself that he is a teenager. Because he is soo cute and innocent. Cuteness overloadSigil who is another Farley. We don't see much of her here only in the last 1/3rd of the book . She is brave clever and she like Sorasa can kill u very easilyCharlon that guy is funny. He has a ~mysterious pat~ which Im looking forward to learning more about.Valtik omg she is a witchy witch. She is Old with a capital O. she will speak mysteriously and irritate you but U can't help loving her.Relationships and RomanceThis book hints at many upcoming relationships in the sequel. It lays down the foundation and hints at something bigger!!!!The Friendships in this book are to die for ah! Sorasa and Corayne and Sigil omg! F/F friendships are literally the bestDom and Andry omg their relationship is like mentor disciple!

And writing in 3rd POV definitely suits her!And Omg we got a Farley😭And a Maven like character?AND NO MARE YAAYYYYVillian on Villain romance ahhhhhThis book did not have all that drama from Red queen and it felt soo refreshing after reading some very particular YA boooks.The first book has laid some base for some great relationships, character dynamics and has all the promises for an epic fantasy seriesThis book was slow-paced at the very start and there were some info dumps at the beginning but at about 20% it picked up and I loved it sm<33And I can't believe I have to wait for the second book . It doesn't even have a title😭Review to come----------------------------------------OMG OMG OMG OMG AHHHIM SOO EXCITEDI PREORDERED THIS BOOK AHHHHHHOMG OMG OMGI WILL NOT CALM DOWN UNTIL THIS BOOK IS IN MY HANDSS
