holy smokes. this is the fantasy adventure story we deserve this summer.things we love to see:- medieval kingdom vibes but with pirates! and monsters! - a large cast of characters with my favourites being a soft boi, a morally grey queen, and that one stoic duty-bound character who is adorable when teased.- great fantasy tropes like a group of strangers on a mission to save the word, old magic bloodlines, an immortal race advising humans, and unexpected fate.honestly, this reminded me a lot of ‘there will come a darkness,’ just with how each of the characters play a part for a greater purpose. and although there are so many of them, i wouldnt necessarily say this story is character driven. its definitely propelled by the plot - so much happens! but the characters do have depth to them (even the ones introduced towards the end), which i appreciated.this is lengthy, but the 550+ pages blew by so quickly. fingers crossed the next book is just as long!thank you so much to harpercollins for the ARC!!↠ 4.5 stars
