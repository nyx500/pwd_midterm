this book pretty much includes everything I love! dirty pirates! disappointed mothers! mysterious lineages! extremely tired immortals! destinies being thrust upon the unwilling! a rag tag group of the least likely heroes! a very large and scary world! Victoria takes some tried and true fantasy tropes and once again smashes through them with her sword. it's the most fun I've had in a while.feb 7th edit: reread the physical ARC and my love for this book only grew. cannot wait for everyone to meet this crew of misfits who are often stubborn, sometimes stupid, but always brave in the face of staggering odds. I just! love them so much!!! and the worldbuilding is honestly on a whole other level. Allward lives and breathes as easily as the cast of characters Victoria painstakingly brought to life. preorder now, I promise you'll fall in love.also, VILLAIN ROMANCE!!!!!!!!!!!
