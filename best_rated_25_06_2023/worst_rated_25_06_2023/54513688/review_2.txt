Victoria Aveyard be writing 500 pages of absolutely noting. this book tried to do some much but fell flat. there wasn’t a plot and you can’t convince me, characters are dull, no romance and the world building was good but if i wanted to sit through 500 pages of worldbuilding i would just read a SJM book. I will be reading the sequel because the book has so much potential and i can see this being pretty good but Aveyard has to learn you can’t keep writing these big books that are 80% nothing and then a plot twist in the end this is not 2012 anymore, readers want more than that now.
