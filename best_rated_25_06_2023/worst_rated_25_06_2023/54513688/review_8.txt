“You are a realm breaker…you would crack this world apart and build an empire from its ruins.” To anyone unsure about picking this up because of the Red Queen series (like I was). Don’t be! This is miles better and was honestly such a breath of fresh air 😊Multiple POVs (but not so many that it is confusing), fantastic world building and characterisations. Everything from the young girl thrust into a dangerous world far away from anything she has ever known, to a ruthless, murderous assassin to the sweetest cinnamon roll of a squire. Not forgetting the crazy ass witch and the immortal warrior with an ability to piss off earlier mentioned assassin 😂A dark force is at work, breaking worlds apart and causing chaos. Only one bloodline have the power to stop them - Corayne, daughter of a ruthless pirate, knows nothing of her father or her heritage. But she soon will, and the fate of the world will be on her shoulders. Meanwhile a power hungry Queen will make some pretty dodgy decisions. Honestly such an improvement from the Red Queen series, my only gripe is that I read this one so early I now have to wait ages for book 2!!  “Stand tall and steadfast true. The darkness comes, your choices grow few.” **********************I’ve added this despite being mostly annoyed throughout the entire Red Queen series. 🤷‍♀️
