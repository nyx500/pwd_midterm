3.5/5 starsI'm torn because I really loved Holly Black's writing in this book, but the story still felt too rushed and put together for me. There was lots of insta-love and the characters didn't really get developed - Tana did a bit, but barely. I can understand the rushed feeling because it is a standalone paranormal book - which there are hardly any of - but I've read some great standalones that aren't rushed and include some great character development - I just think this one could've been better!Overall it wasn't a bad book, I definitely enjoyed reading it, but it wasn't one of my favorites and didn't blow my mind.
