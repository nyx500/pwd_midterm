I probably would have rated this a tad lower, but (and I can't BELIEVE I'm saying this) I adored the love triangle.I KNOW, RIGHT?!No one is as surprised by that statement as I am.And it is a love triangle. There's the boy she's loved all of her life, and then there's the boy she's forcibly engaged to. Guess which one I picked?The new guy!Again, no one is as surprised as I am. I'm a HUGE sucker for the We've-Been-Friends-Forever sort of love. Plus, there's no easy winner in this triangle. Like, it doesn't turn out that Mr. Boy Next Door is hiding nefarious plans for world domination or anything. He's awesome, and he really loves her.However, in the immortal words of the philosopher Beyonce...If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it. Nice world building in this one, as well. The concept of the world and it's brand of magic, while not new-new, had a nice flavor to it. Ok. I'm going to be honest. I can't for the life of me figure out a way to describe the plot that sounds even remotely interesting. I've been staring at this page for several hours (read: minutes), and I'm coning up with a blank. Sorry.There's magical relics, quests, a tough heroine, honorable princes, an evil villain, secrets, and dreams from a dead queen.Read it for yourself if you want to know more.I will say that at times my mind did wander a bit between action scenes, but that's typical for me because I have the attention span of a squirrel, and doesn't necessarily reflect poorly on the book. My only quasi-complaint?The Big Twist was something I guessed fairly early on, but that didn't really lessen my enjoyment of the story all that much. So, yeah...tiny annoyance.This was (on the whole) an interesting book, and I had very few issues with it. If you've been sitting on the fence, go ahead and give it a shot.Also reviewed for:
