Reread 2021My reread is officially underway! Enjoyed this just as much the second time, though could do without the ‘Stockholm syndrome’ type romance. ******************Original review 2018 “Bone used to mean good, or prosperous. From the French, bonne...that’s why they named it: the Good Season, the season of prospect. They see it as collecting their reward...Of course, the humans see it differently. To them Bone means that: bones, starvation. Death.” What an incredible debut fantasy! The world building was so intricate, it took a while to make sense of everything, and even then new stuff was still being introduced throughout!Paige is a clairvoyant, a member of an elite group of humans who can sense auras, spirits, and the aether. There is a hierarchy within the clairvoyant society, and Paige is a dreamWalker, one of the highest and most uncommon gifts. However, the society in which they live - Scion, looks down on and fears Voyants. They are forced into hiding, searched out and even killed. When Paige gets herself into a dodgy situation on a train and 2 guards are killed she is forced to flee. Unfortunately she is captured, and the place she is taken to is worse than any she could have imagined. Full of wonderful gifts, spirits, poltergeists and dangerous villains. This is an incredible work of fantasy, particularly as a debut by this author! I cannot wait to continue this series!******************************************What a wild ride! RTC
