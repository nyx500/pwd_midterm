when they say: “what do we say to the god of death?” we say:“I would not let a man who knew the value of nothing, make me doubt the value of myself.”I am this close to having that quote tattooed on my forehead. (definitely read the content warnings at the bottom for this book though). Some characters make some questionable choices but I understand that these were the grecian times…↣ This is a quick but emotional read that spans through Adriane’s whole life. It deals with motherhood and the complications of human relationships/feelings while making you feel like you are living in the Greek myths themselves. And I don’t care what anyone says, I liked the ending. No need for any greek myths research (don't do it!!) just take what you know and read. ↢P.S.
