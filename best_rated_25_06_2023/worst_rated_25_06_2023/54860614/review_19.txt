"No longer was my world one of brave heroes; I was learning all too swiftly the women's pain that throbbed unspoken through the tales of their feats." Ariadne, the Princess of Crete has loved to dance ever since she was young. She enjoys listening to the stories of heroes and gods that her nursemaids tell her about. But every year the Minotaur, who is trapped in the Labyrinth, requires a blood sacrifice. Then Theseus, the Prince of Athens comes to slay the Minotaur and she sees her chance to escape. Ariadne decides to help Theseus kill the Minotaur but her choice comes at a heavy cost. Will her decision end happily? What will happen to her sister Phaedra who doesn't escape with her?This was a great retelling about loss, love, sacrifice, power and greed. The beginning started off a little slow, but soon after I was transported into an intriguing world of gods and heroes. I loved Ariadne, she is brave, optimistic, kind, and loving. I also liked Phaedra, she is stubborn, brave, clever, and cunning. I liked that the characters are relatable they each go through challenges and hardships and find different ways of coping. The character development was very good, there were so many sides to the characters especially Dionysus, Theseus and Phaedra. The writing and storytelling in this book is excellent. I really appreciated that the author wrote the story from Ariadne and Phaedra's perspective, it was refreshing. It showed me how much a story can change depending on who tells it. The ending was sad and heartbreaking. This book will stay with me for a while.
