âžµ my mind is blown away. someone please tell me why i'm feeling both happy and sad, heartbroken and hopeful, at the end of this. absolutely can't wait for the next book! rtc.27.11.2021 i've been eyeing this book for more than a year since its announcement and now i'll finally be reading it early. tbh, i expect excellence because this sounds amazing. 21.08.2020 a half monster who who wants to be a hero; rival families; a paranormal world hidden within london? okay, so you mean i'm going to love it.
