𝟐.𝟑 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐬Just ok! Honestly, I liked the idea and a few other things here. But it still didn't work for me. There were many errors. Sad to say that the author was unable to structure the story tightly and convincingly. The most confusing thing I found here is that, after reading 65%, I didn't know what happened or what the author was trying to do. It seemed that everything was moving at a very fast pace and jumping from here to there without any details, which is why it was very hard to get through some parts. Anyway, if the second half had been as good as the beginning, maybe the book would have easily gotten 4 stars from me.
