this started off pretty rough, but im glad i pushed through it because i actually ended up liking it by the end. lets talk about the first half. yes, its slow. yes, the world-building is lacking. yes, its a little bit boring. yes, the characters are pretty flat. but eventually you come to a moment where you realise things are actually more interesting than you think. it just takes time. and honestly, vince is the key. im so glad i found him intriguing enough from the beginning or else i dont think i would have made it to that moment. vince and his mysteriousness is the glue that holds this entire story together. so i think if you have patience for the slowest of slow burning plots, plus have an open mind and are receptive to how different this story is, then i think you might enjoy this, too. â†  3.5 stars
