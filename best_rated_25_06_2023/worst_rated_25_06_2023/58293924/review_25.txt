I have odd, conflicted feelings on this one, because on the one hand it is Holly Black, a legend in the fantasy world, and on the other, this didn't feel up to par for what I would expect a Holly Black novel to provide. It wasn't made clear going in that this would be either the first in a series or a stand alone that leaves you with little to no closure, which is one of my pet peeves, and there wasn't really anything I could put my finger on that made this feel "adult" compared to her YA books. The world building was lacking, and I'm still trying to determine if I understand the magic system beyond the fact that it involves shadows, perhaps because there aren't a definitive set of rules that keep the characters grounded. All that said, the last portion of the book really picked up the pace and things started happening that made me not want to put it down, so I have hope that if the author chooses to write a sequel to Book of Night, it will be an improvement from this installment.
