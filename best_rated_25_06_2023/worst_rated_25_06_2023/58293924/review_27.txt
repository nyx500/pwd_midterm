I really liked this book! This was such a unique and intriguing urban fantasy book full of mysteries, magic, and betrayals. Charlie Hall is a con artist who works for gloamists, magicians who alter shadows to steal, kill or worse. Charlie tries to separate herself from her past mistakes, but her past catches up with her. Charlie learns that her boyfriend, Vince has been lying to her and soon after she finds herself caught up in lies and murder. She will do anything to survive and protect the people she loves. The pacing in the beginning of the book was very slow and it took me a while to get into the story, but by the middle I was very intrigued by the world the author created. The book is told from Charlie and Vince's point of view. The world building was a little lacking, but the shadow magic was really cool. I really liked Charlie, she is tough, stubborn, fierce and will do anything for those she loves. I liked Vince, he is mysterious, helpful, and really cares for Charlie. I liked Charlie's sister Posey, but I wish we learned more about her character and who she is as a person. I wish there was more romance in the book. There were a few romantic scenes between Charlie and Vince, but I wanted more. I enjoyed learning about Charlie and Vince's past and I liked that the author switched between past and present time. There were several twists and turns that I didn't see coming. The ending was so good and shocking!
