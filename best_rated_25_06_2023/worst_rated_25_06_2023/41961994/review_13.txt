An original book about books! The Library of the Unwritten is the first in a new fantasy series. The premise? Books that are not finished by authors reside in the Library of the Unwritten in Hell. The job of the Librarian? Tracking down any of the characters who may emerge from the stories.Claire has been the Head Librarian of the Unwritten Wing for many years. It’s her job to do the mundane mostly; repairing books and organizing them, but every once in a while, a character gets loose, and she has to find him or her. In fact, a Hero escapes from a book and is in search of the author. Claire has some help to assist her in tracking him down.But things go awry in a very bad way…Aww, I loved these characters! They were witty and clever with fun banter. The first half of the book clipped along and the ending? Well, it ended with a big ole bang! There’s so much to look forward to in the next installment and yet this book ended in a satisfactory way. Kudos to the author for that. Kudos to her for the whole thing!I received a complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.Many of my reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com
