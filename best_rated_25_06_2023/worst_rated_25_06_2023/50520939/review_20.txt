sorry i’m just sitting here thinking about how much i actually hated this book so i changed my rating to 2 LMAO. — i Wanted to like this book soooo bad bc it seemed to have so many things that i love and am interested in (the library of alexandria still existing helloooo??) but it just... i felt like it was never going to end. the magic system was confusing and i never really knew what was going on. it really only got going the last 20 pages which is annoying. the characters were v interesting but there were a few that when it was their chapters i knew i was gonna be bored. i probably will read the next one but god i hope it’s less long winded and maybe has a bit more world building
