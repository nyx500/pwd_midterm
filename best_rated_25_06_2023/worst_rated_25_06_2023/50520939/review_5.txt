The Atlas Six is a fantasy novel that understands what the people want and that is more dark academia stories with self-indulgent prose, impeccable vibes and aesthetics, and hot morally fraudulent characters who are constantly and agonizingly on the verge of either killing each other or fucking each other. That is, when they're not preoccupied with the pursuit of godhood (but more often than not they can multitask).
