This book is pure trash and I blame tiktok for setting my expectations way too high. This book has no plot that is understandable besides the last like 20 pages and even that's a stretch. The characters feel so....weird and pretentious and fake. Their relationships with each other was boring. This book just feels like someone telling you about their original characters and their magic but nothing about the world or plot
