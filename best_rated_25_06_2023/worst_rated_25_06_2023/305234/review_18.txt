Are there any books on your to-read list that you've been (consciously or unconsciously) avoiding because people keep harassing you to read them? Then, when you read them, do you kick yourself for being so stubborn?On one hand, I'm really happy I waited to read this book, because the third (and final? Edit: No, there's a book 4, at least...) book just came out, so no waiting for me! On the other hand... WHAT WAS I WAITING FOR????? This book was AWESOME!!I don't know that I was avoiding it because of what other people were saying, necessarily. I don't know where my prejudice against faery books comes from, but it's there nonetheless! (That's why I haven't read Holly Black's books, either...) Why would I not like them? Maybe I thought they were wussy little creatures... A Midsummer Night's Dream turned me off to them, perhaps?But whatever the reason, I'm glad I got over myself and read this book! I haven't been so surprised by the twists and turns a plot has taken in quite some time! I just... I didn't know what was going to happen! I thought I knew, and in ONE respect, I was right, but I was wrong about all the others! And that's funâ€”being surprised by the character's decisions. I loved all the characters (except the Winter Queen, of course)! Aislinn was AWESOME! I was a little worried about her in the middle... but by the end, she was pretty kick-ass. Keenan even turned out pretty well! ;) I'm in love with Seth and all his scary body piercings! (Never thought I'd say that in my lifetime....) And Donia... oh, I felt for her... Really great characters....About 20 pages from the end (the last chapter), I was spazzing out. I have no experience with Melissa Marr, so I had no idea if she was a happy-ending author or a depressing-ending author.... I had a HUGE grin on my face at the end. HUGE. I can't wait to read Ink Exchange and Fragile Eternity!! (Ink Exchange isn't due back to the library until August 17th! What am I going to do??!?!??)
