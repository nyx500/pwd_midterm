to compare this to ACOTAR is a disservice to not only the reader, but to both books, as well. it sets an impossibly high standard, one that only leads to disappointment (because we all know SJM is the queen of fae). so having seen a lot of negative reviews in regards to how this book is pitched and the comparisons made, i decided to go into this with a completely open mind and no expectations whatsoever - which i think is the only thing you can do in this particular situation. and it completely paid off because i quite liked this!the story itself is interesting. not exactly unique, but just the right amount of captivating to keep me engaged in the plot. stories about fae are pretty common, so i really enjoy how this introduces some aspects i havent previously read and provides new things to learn about that particular world. the writing also has a brilliant flow - so much so that i read this in nearly one sitting because i just wanted to keep reading. there is such an effortless quality to how this is written that you can go from page 1 to 100 in the blink of an eye. its just that inviting and easy to consume. i think people who go into this expecting it to be exactly like ACOTAR in terms of plot and quality will be a bit disappointed with this. but its a strong enough story in its own right and should be treated as such, because it definitely provided a full afternoon of light and magical entertainment for me!â†  4 stars
