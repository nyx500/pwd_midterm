This was pretty underwhelming, which is a huge bummer, because I really wanted to like it.A lot of people might compare this at first to ACOTAR because of the fair folk and their courts, but - surprise! - fairies and their courts are actually longstanding fairy lore that go back centuries. Sarah J. Maas didn't make all that up on her own. Anyway, as I said, I really wanted to like this, if only for the cover.But, alas, the world building felt unfinished, the purpose and direction of the story was unclear to the very end, and the characters were a group of bland strangers I never truly got to know. I love fairy court folklore and had high hopes for this book; however, the only thing that truly impressed me here was the fact that I finished it, which again: bummer, especially since Rogerson has a very fluid and engaging writing style.As such, despite my lackluster response to this book, I could probably be convinced to attempt another book by her, provided the blurb sounded interesting. And I got it on sale.In the end, Iâ€™m glad this at least has a purty cover, since I have it in hardback via Uppercase. So at least it will look pretty on my shelves if nothing else.
