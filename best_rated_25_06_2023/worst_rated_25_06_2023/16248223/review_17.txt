Exceedingly enjoyable fantasy novel set in the Chinese community of historical Malaya, where Li Lin's down-on-his-luck father proposes she become a ghost bride, ie marry a dead guy so he can have a wife in the afterlife. This spools out into a murder mystery, plus a fantasy rooted in Chinese myth and folklore and funereal beliefs, plus a romance that doesn't go where you initially think, but definitely goes to the right place. Our heroine is a bit wet at first but shines up her spine as the book develops, and the setting is vivid and really creepy at points. Very good fun.
