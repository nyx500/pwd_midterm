4.5â˜…"The problem with the dead was that they all wanted someone to listen to them."Now, I wouldn't have thought this was my sort of read at all, but it shows how wrong you can be.More than what I was expecting as I knew there would be the fantastic and paranormal,this was also a (somewhat tepid) romance and a murder mystery. Ms Choo's use of evocative language is assured - quite amazing that this book was a debut. Ms Choo allows us to pick delicately through Li Lan's complicated beliefs - every bit as complicated as life in nineteenth century Malaya would be. I just accepted everything I was shown.Quite wonderful. I'm only knocking half a star off, because in the middle it dragged a bit & because I guessed the two twists quite easily.https://wordpress.com/view/carolshess...
