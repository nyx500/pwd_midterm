12.01: On offer Today for 1,99. Enjoyed this a lot although I did not have many hopes. I bought the book because i found it as book deal on kindle. I am really happy that I the book read since I learned a lot about old Malaya's culture and history. Also, it was fascinating how the author introduced the reader into the world of the Chinese-Malayan myths about the afterlife. What I liked the most about this book is how beautifully the author describes the sights and culture of Malaya. I remember reading about some food the main character was eating at the party and it made me seriously crave for what she was eating. I do not think this happened in other books I read. She made me see, smell and feel, just like i was there inside the book. The action flows fast enough not to get bored and there is also a love story. However, the magic of the book is in the worlds the author creates, both of the living and the dead.
