This really was some gothic excellence, omg.Please allow for a small list of all the things that made this story REALLY GOOD imo:1. The setting!!! High Place’s aesthetic of rotting decadence was exactly the kind of atmosphere I LOVE in horror2. Noemi!! She was such a headstrong MC and so capable the whole way through. Truly a delight to read about3. The historical setting! The 1950’s is not a time that I’ve read a lot about, and it was quite interesting. The way the author worked discussions about colonialism, racism, and eugenics into the plot was really well done too.4. The weirdness! Lots of spooky and gross things going on here. While I did find certain parts of the mystery a bit on the predictable side, there was ultimately so much happening that it kept me engaged & the body horror was TRIPPY!!!
