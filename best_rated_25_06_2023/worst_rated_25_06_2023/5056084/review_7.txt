Wings was definitely a unique take on fairy mythology. And I finally get the significance of the cover now, which I have to say fits the novel perfectly. 		I’m a huge fan of the Faery/Fairy/Fae... (was it is really?) genre, or rather sub-genre. I wasn’t surprised that I really liked this novel. Sensational plot line, really different than anything I’ve read. The first part of the novel moved a little slow for me. But once I became fully engrossed in the world that Pike created, I couldn’t get through the pages fast enough. The writing was outstanding, it flowed really well. It’s one of those instances where you don’t realize your reading it’s so easy to read. Maybe that’s just something that happens to me personally, but I love when it does. The characters were also really well depicted. Although we don’t know much about Laurel’s history, I still felt like I really knew her as a character, and even though Tamani’s presence in the novel is few and far between, he is probably my favorite character, which says a lot for Pike’s character development. And then of course one of my personal favorite elements in any story.... the love triangle! I can’t wait to see more of that in the future novels, as far as I’m aware I believe there are to be three more, consisting of a four book series.... I could be wrong. Overall, a exciting and beautifully written novel!
