Most of my friends rated this book one star, and some friends even have it on shelves to avoid... but there's just something about it that I really enjoyed...Although Laurel is a TERRIBLE heroine, and I went into this book with quite low expectations (see my 'morbid curiosity shelf, reserved for books I have heard terrible things about but still have a desire to read) and the only reason I picked it up was because I saw it on the shelf in my local library... I actually enjoyed the book.Aprilynne Pike first turned me off reading ‘Wings’ when she blurbed Kiersten White’s Paranormalcy basically saying that she preferred the rapey stalker to the nice boy in that book’s love triangle – probably because he was a ‘hot’ faerie ��� and I stayed away from this book for years. I’ve put books down because of who blurbed them, and I’ve picked books up due to blurbs from authors I trust. Although Stephenie Meyer is a friend of Pike’s (and I hear recommended her to her own superstar agent) and I’m not a huge Meyer fan, I do actually trust her taste in paranormal romance – she did, after all, write only the most popular paranormal romance ever which, it mostly seems, too many other PNRs try to emulate. One of the things that drew me to Wings was the idea of the girl being the monster, not the boy. I was already reading Hereafter, although that was starting to grate on me, so I picked up Wings……and promptly read about half of it in one sitting.It was very addictive. Although Laurel’s a despicable heroine – she’s perfect in every way, clearly has anorexia although no one thinks it’s out of the ordinary, compares herself favourably to supermodels and is generally more beautiful, graceful, and smarter and more modest than everyone else – she’s also incredibly judgemental, which totally annoyed the crap out of me. When Laurel meets a new boy and notices his straight teeth, she immediately assumes he’s had braces, even though she runs her tongue over her own 'naturally straight teeth’. If hers are so perfect, why can’t anyone else’s be natural? She meets a boy with brilliant green eyes and immediately assumes he’s wearing contact lenses. And even though Laurel is a perfect fragile princess whom everyone adores, she’s still self-conscious enough to want to hide away even though she clearly has nothing to hide.Well, except for the blossom that grows out of her back and marks her sexual maturity. That’s right: the ‘wings’ that the book is named for is actually a plant because – surprise surprise! Perfect Laurel is actually a plant – a faerie to be exact – and this most beautiful, intoxicating display is a natural part of a faerie’s maturing process. Never mind that fact that at first Laurel has no idea she isn’t human and refuses to tell her mother – who home schooled her, so you’d think there’s be a certain level of trust there – that she’s growing a flower out of her back. Nope, instead Laurel runs off and tells her new BFF hot-nerd boy (which I have to give kudos for, because nerds are hot) instead. If I was Laurel, I would have been all like ‘there’s a parasitic flower growing out of my skin, get me to a hospital!’ But because Laurel’s adopted parents (aha!) are so new-age hippy-ish none of them ever go to hospitals or even see doctors… and all of this is relevant to the plot.Laurel’s blossom didn’t seem to last for a very long part of the book. Most of the plot up until now was very solid – and the writing was for the most part more than bearable –  but when Laurel met another faerie – a hot boy one, of course, who mirrored Patch in his cockiness and sexual innuendo – and he told her that he puts his hands in her blossom to make a seed and that her ‘human’ sex organs were not reproductive and therefore just for fun… that’s when I started to go a little loopy. Laurel immediately assumes that she can have sex with no strings attached just because she can’t get pregnant. As an added bonus, she’s actually nineteen, not fifteen, so she has a bonus instant age of consent! Up until this point, I was really enjoying the book. The wings seemed more like an opportunity to send her to the school dance and have everyone be amazed at how beautiful she was rather than the other important plot point which revealed she was actually a faerie. So that was weird.One of the other things I liked was that the romance developed by trying to figure out what the heck Laurel was, and the villain wasn’t just tacked on in the last quarter of the book to create a climax. It was woven all the way through – you could tell who the villain was, because he was ‘ugly’, ‘unsymmetrical’ and ‘creepy.’ And apparently all lower evolved creatures are – faeries, who are so incredibly beautiful, are perfectly symmetrical. That’s right, all my mentally and physically disabled readers, all my burns and other accident victims and pretty much everyone who’s not a supermodel – you’re ugly because you’re unsymmetrical and therefore lesser evolved! Yeah, that part was weird and I skipped over it so sorry if I got it wrong.  As if Laurel wasn’t perfect enough.I think Laurel could have redeemed herself just a bit with me if she’d been able to defeat the bad guy herself. In the end she couldn’t even do that and even though she’s the monster of the book, she still had to be rescued. My inner feminist fumes. It appears in PNR that no matter if the girl is the human or the monster, she’ll still need to be rescued. I know, I know – I need to switch genres if I want to read about girls who can actually look after themselves – but still.Overall the writing wasn’t perfect but it was easy to read, and I was in a relatively good mood when I read the book so I just laughed at all the stupid stuff instead of getting all knotted up and ranting and raving like I did about Hush, Hush. I think out of all the hyped PNRs I’ve read, Wings has the strongest plot, and Laurel is not as bad as Nora and not as stupid as Luce, and more capable than Bella. It’s not the best book I’ve read and I still hate Laurel – not because she’s a perfect Mary Sue but because she’s so damned judgemental and convinced no one could even be as perfect as her and I totally don’t buy her whole ‘I hate being the centre of attention’ thing. However, I enjoyed it enough to want to read the other books in the trilogy and I’m not even dreading it. Pike doesn’t need ‘another chance’ with me – I like her writing, if not her heroine.It’s entertaining fluff and if you like PNR you’ll most probably like this. If you’re not a huge fan of PNR, then this will probably be hit or miss – it just happened to tickle my fancy at the time.Happy reading!
