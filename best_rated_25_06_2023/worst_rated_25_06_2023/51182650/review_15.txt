Plot: The plot felt suuuuper slow. There was just so much inner dialogue and description, and it didn’t seem like that much happened outside of it, especially for the first half of the book.  Characters: Soraya was painfully naive, which I guess makes sense since she had been isolated her whole life. But still, yikes. The villain was very predictable, and I didn’t feel anything strongly for them or the MC. The pariks were the best characters, but had a small role.Overall: This book is based on Persian mythology, which was super interesting and new to me. The message was nice, but I wish the world, plot, and characters had been more thoroughly developed. They weren’t bad, but left me wanting more.
