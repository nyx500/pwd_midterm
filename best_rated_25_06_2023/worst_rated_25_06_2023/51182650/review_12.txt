”You could kill me with a single touch. Why should you ever be afraid of anyone?”4.5****This book was captivating and unexpected, filled with Persian mythology and culture. Our main protagonist, Soraya, the sister of the Shah, is cursed- she is poisonous to the touch causing almost instant death to most living and breathing things she touches. Living a life of exile in the palace, we witness her loneliness, jealousies and fear of her own power. When Soraya hears that a Div has been captured, she immediately sets out to find answers about her curse and how to get rid of it. She also captures the attention of a new soldier along the way providing her with new opportunities to explore a whole new world outside the confines of the Palace. This wasn’t a romance book so much as a book of a character’s evolution and discovering her power. We witness everything from Soraya’s perspective; how she has jealousies, loneliness, anger, love. She is not the perfect princess that most fairytales portray, and this story instead shows her villainous side as well. This book features a bisexual heroine (which was a unique touch as this still does not always arise in YA fantasy) as she tries to navigate her feelings despite being cursed. This is her discovering the truth of the past, why she is cursed, and the awakenings and longings that arise outside of the Palace that she is kept in. I adored the use of Persian mythology in this. This is the first book that introduced me to Persian myths and I was fully immersed in reading it. This book also featured a girl who is poisonous to the touch which had me highly interested to read this book. This book had different twists and played out in ways that I did not predict- which was a nice surprise.A fantastic magical standalone!
