I liked the plucky heroine and the brooding vampire but the book just went on FOREVER. Upon my attempt at a reread, I'm sorry to say that I feel the same way now as I did before. Con and Sunshine had good chemistry but there's so much pointless filler. The paperback is 400 pages but I don't think it needed to be. There's a lot of pointless meandering that could have been shaved off. McKinley has always been a hit or miss author for me, although I appreciate her more as an adult than I did as a teen, but I'm sorry to say that this one is more of a miss.2 stars
