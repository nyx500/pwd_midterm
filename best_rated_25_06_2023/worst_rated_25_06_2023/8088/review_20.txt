3.5What a frustrating book! On one side, this is an amazing read. McKinley paints a deeply complex and detailed world peopled by humans, weres, vampires, demons, and people who can wield magic. The feel is very much urban however, but one that has suffered wars and has not yet quite recovered. The author succeeds in conveying such depths that it is only too easy to immerse oneself. Characters are also brilliantly portrayed, full of subtlety and ambiguity. Rae is very easy to like. Her seemingly simple life as a baker (yes, the descriptions of her baking are mouth-watering!) transforms into something else but nothing is as what it seems. Additionally, the vampires in this story are nothing we have come used to expect. There is an alieness to them that makes them more than just 'Other' - somehow even repulsive.So, what went wrong? Well, as much as I liked Rae, her narration ended up distancing me from the story. The first person in this instance becomes a kind of stream of consciousness. Usually I'm fine with this but here it made the narrative convoluted. This annoyed me to no end because otherwise I can see I would have loved this book.Perhaps it is me after all... I may try to give Sunshine another go in a while.
