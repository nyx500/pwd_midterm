I'm afraid I won't be finishing this one. This is pretty disappointing, because everyone seems to love it and that cover is just beautiful, but the book itself... Maybe it does get better, after 100 pages it feels like a slog already, so I just don't think it is for me. I won't give it a rating, but I do have to say, the downfall of The Belles for me is the fact that the author just tries so hard to make it original and special, but all this faffing about results in the story and character development falling by the wayside. The book really overuses metaphors and similes (reminding me a little of Caraval, though I quite enjoyed that book). Camellia didn't strike me as likable, or even particularly interesting, and I am a reader who can forgive a weak story if the characters are well written. I also got tired very quickly of all this talk about beauty, blah, blah, blah. I'm guessing the story will deepen and there will be far more to it, but as I say, I did read 100 pages, and I generally think I can get a decent sense of whether I will like a book by then. I wish I could write a rave review for this book and tell you that I really loved it, unfortunately it just wasn't for me. Hope you enjoy it more, if you give it a try!Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com
