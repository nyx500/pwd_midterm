My feelings on this are quite mixed. I liked aspects, but disliked others, was intrigued and excited at times, but also bored at others. The Good: POC main character, interesting world, diabolical villain, beautiful descriptions I liked Camille, and her character growth through the bookThere were a fair few plot twists that were great too The Bad: The pacing wasn't the best in my opinion, as I said above. i got bored at pointsI also think the world building could've been a bit more structured. Like we did get a good overview of the world and how the Arcana works, but it didn't feel quite as structured as I would've liked it to be. Also the descriptions were a little over descriptive too, as well as a bit repetitive Overall this was an okay first book in a series, but it didn't blow me away I'm not sure If i'll continue the series yet. It'll depend on the description of the next book I suppose, but at the minute, I don't think it's likely. I think i'll lose interest between now and the next book coming out, as it will probably be 1 year +I honestly wish I could've loved this, but it wasn't meant to be haha
