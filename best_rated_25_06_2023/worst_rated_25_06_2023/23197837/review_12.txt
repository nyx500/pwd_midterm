3.75/5The writing was beautiful and I enjoyed our main character a ton. 🌺🌹I did feel like the plot was a little slow throughout the book but it really picked up towards the end of it. I enjoyed the aspect and the overall theme of the book and how it centers around beauty and what is beauty as well as how far people will go to be beautiful.🌸💐There were a few things I didn’t like which is why ultimately I gave this book a ⭐️⭐️⭐️.75 but I still really enjoyed it.There is a trigger ⚠️ for attempted sexual assault in this book.I will be filming a mashup review on this book very soon so look out for that to hear more of my thoughts.Overall a solid start to an intriguing ya fantasy series!
