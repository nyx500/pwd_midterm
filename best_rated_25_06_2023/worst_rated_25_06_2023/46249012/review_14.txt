I'm also a book blogger: Vee_BookishThe idea of this is so much better than the execution and the start was so promising I was predicting 5 stars - two friends, both coming of age and expected to lure a man and kill him. You've got the polar opposites - Alesse that hunts animals and enjoys it, and Sabine, who has only killed one animal and hated it.The story fell apart when Alesse met her Amoure, Bastian, a boy who decided the best way to avenge his father's death is to kill a completely random Bone Crier. After he kidnaps Alesse he seems to forget the whole murdered Dad thing cos, damn, she cute. Their relationship was so random, I couldn't understand why they were together. There was no build up except a vague attempt at enemies to lovers which was quickly abandoned.The random French words scattered throughout and the italicised words really got on my nerves. B French or don't, don't use the word Dauphin and then Prince in the next sentence to explain it to the audience. The French setting didn't work for me either, there was a lack of world building and the extra character at the end confused me, as we hadn't been given a good explanation of how the world worked, except clues that it might be Paris? Maybe?A lot of this story is vague guesswork on the part of the reader. You have catacombs and French, so that leads you to Paris. There's fantasy elements like the Bone Criers, but no explanation of why they have magic and how it works. We are told Bastien is a wanted thief, but the story doesn't go into that. Then there's sacred bridges, Gods and ghosts. It's all rather confusing.Some of the story devolved into soap opera declarations and bizarre twist reveals that weren't surprisingly so much as silly and overdone. Those reveals really weakened the story for me and made it very hard for me to continue to force myself through it.
