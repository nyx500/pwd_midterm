when i went into this book i had really low expectations because i hadn’t heard too many good things about this book but i actually ended up loving it. i love the Ailesse SO MUCH!! i love sabine and their friendship as well. A lot of people didn’t like the romance but i thought it made so much sense? This was a great book and i cant wait to read the sequel.
