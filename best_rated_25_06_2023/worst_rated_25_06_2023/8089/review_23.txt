Reading this book is like watching someone else's dream. Things happen inexplicably and the dreamer is unruffled, incurious. She just moves on to the next strange occurrence. You get a sense of symbolism everywhere, but the symbols are specific to the dreamer herself, and have nothing to do with you, nothing to tell you. The people in the dream are not people at all, they are personified roles and attributes - Bravery, Intelligence, Wealth, Wisdom, Envy - moving through a landscape of Big Town, Small Town, Manor House, Enchanted House.Everything is heavy with magic, every living thing and situation, but it's unclear, really, what the hell is going on. Even when Beauty finally gets some explanations, at the very end, it doesn't make a lot of sense. And, like a dreamer, she doesn't mind at all. Because Happily Ever After. And given the choice, she chooses poverty, and for the Beast to not revert to his human form, because "not even the wisest married pair can see the best way to dispense justice for people beyond their own ken." Ergo (apparently) being human, having power and wealth, are Bad. So much so that Beauty, who was herself the personification of Kindness, would have become some kind of tyrant if she'd gone that way. A large statement of belief crammed into a very small space, jarring even within the illogical dream-story.Sorcery and the quest for knowledge are also Bad, by the way. Sorcerers are inevitably utter bastards - save the Beast, when he was human, but it's cool because he thought sorcery was a false discipline and went with philosophy, instead. Greenwitches are ok, because Nature is Good. All very black-or-white. It's a dream.It's an ok story. Not really recommended. I remember McKinley's first Beauty and the Beast story was quite a bit better - think I'll find and re-read that one.
