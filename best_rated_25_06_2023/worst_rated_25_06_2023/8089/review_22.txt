(Re-read)I liked this better than Beauty. At least, most of it. By the end, I was bored and ready for it to be over.I came closer to believing in the love story here, but not close enough. And I guess McKinley's writing doesn't match my tastes so well anymore. Too much description!(Makes me want to read a really awesome Beauty & the Beast retelling, though. The trick, of course, being it has to be awesome for me.)
