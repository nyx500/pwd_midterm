Am I expecting too much from a book these days? Or the books are just dull? I mean, I expected an angsty, swoon worthy romance. I thought there's gonna be a lot of will they-won't they moment. I also expected a grumpy hero with a mysterious past (Yeah I'm that typical. Judge me)But there was nothing in this book! The hero was boring and plain and more boring. There was literally no chemistry between the two MC. Most of the time they are just talking and arguing over lame stuffs and then he just cuts her off. Repeat. The plot?MC is talking with her new "elf friend" or reading journals. Again some talking about plants, short argument with the elf king, again reading journal (sounds exiting right?)There's a few things I liked too. Like the protagonist wasn’t as annoying as I thought she'd be. I mean, she's bold and strong willed and admirable. I can't say the same about the author's previous protagonists. Even though nothing happens in this book but the writing was good. I didn’t feel bored for a moment. It has a Hades-Persephone vibe but it's not for A Court of Thorns and Roses fans! If you want to read a cute fantasy romance? Sure go on. But if you're looking for something like A Court of Thorns and Roses, here's a friendly reminder, don't let the synopsis fool you.
