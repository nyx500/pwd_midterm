Juvenile dialogue. Emotional depth of characters is flaky at best. Hero is supposed to be this hard, powerful male who staggers when she expresses sympathy for him? Really? Heroine talks about being duty-bound all the time but thinks it’s okay to take off a few days after going to the otherworld realm simply because she doesn’t like it? Heroine is made out to be the only one to contest her fate because of her herbalist duties because almost 30 Human Queens before her were starry-eyed dumb bitches who didn’t have a life? Yeah, she’s special alright.
