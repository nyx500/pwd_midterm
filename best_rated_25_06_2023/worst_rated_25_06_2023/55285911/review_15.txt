the magic system gave my head physical pain.the main couple lacked any semblance of chemistry.the love was just lust on steroids.the drama felt like high school angst.the worldbuilding made absolutely zero sense.the characters I couldn't care less about.the action was nonexistent.even the cute wolf couldn't save it for me.one star and i'm not wasting any more brain cells on this.
