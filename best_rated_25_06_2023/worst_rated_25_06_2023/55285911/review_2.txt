- Hades & Persephone- Beauty & the Beast- elves & faeriesWhat more could you want??? 😉 This was such a fun read! Going into this, I didn’t expect much. At first, the writing style didn’t appeal to me and nothing in particular stood out to me, but I’m so glad I continued reading because I was wrong! 😏 I ended up having a grand time with this! Luella and Eldas definitely snuck up on me. I thought she’d be some average fiery heroine and he some average dark faery/elf/troll/goblin (dealer’s choice lol), but they actually really grew on me! Both as individuals and as a couple! It left me with a similar kind of joy that Cruel Beauty did. It also had some Stolen Songbird vibes. 🥰PSA: While this is the first in the series (Elise Kova says there are four planned books in this world, at the moment), it is also a standalone, so you needn’t worry about cliffhangers...which I find SO REFRESHING! 😅 Despite how much I liked this, I simply couldn’t award this five stars because there’s not anything new about it either. It’s just pure enjoyment...which is honestly what most of us need this year, anyway. Sooooo...I’ll just sit here and wait for the next one! 😂
