EMPIRE OF SAND is the kind of book that you have to reread certain parts, or read more slowly, just so you can savor the words, story, and development. At least, that's what I did. Inspired by the Mughal era of India, EMPIRE OF SAND features a resilient heroine who struggles to survive in an empire where her people, the Amrithi, are despised. Throughout her journey, she finds hope and kindness and respect in the unlikeliest of places. Think of it as loosely beginning like THE WRATH AND THE DAWN with more mature characters, and the phenomenal world-building of CITY OF BRASS, with a heart-stopping romance like in A CROWN OF WISHES. Basically, a must-read for fantasy readers. Review to come!
