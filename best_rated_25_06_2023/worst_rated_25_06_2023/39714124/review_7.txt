The potential was breathtaking, but the execution was feeble.Goodreads really needs to add half-stars, because two is too low and three is too high. Empire of Sand isn't bad. It just isn't good, either. I liked the writing. I liked the two main characters. I liked the concept. It had so much potential be something truly special and rare... but instead it was underwhelming and boring.The main problem with Empire of Sand is how the length in no way reflects the actual content in the book. I was looking forward to haunting lore and wild beauty, but I got daiva that showed up three times despite being one of the things the book promises most. I wanted to see an intricate city with vibrant culture and panoramic dunes, but I found worldbuilding that was essentially just a regular city and a desert. Amun and Mehr were good characters in a book that didn't have much going on. I wish the Empire had more of a role in their stories. There weren't enough things happening to Mehr and Amun. I still don't understand the magic system, the storms, the Maha, or the mystics. I feel like I fell asleep during the middle of an audiobook and woke up at the end, even though I read this as an ebook. The conflict was resolved in three pages after way too much buildup. I did enjoy a few of the chapters towards the end, and Mehr was a nice character because of her quiet intelligence.2.5 starsBuddy read with my fellow clown. We don't understand what the plot of this book is.
