In the city of Bethal the prophet is law. The scriptures are the rules to live by. Immanuelle Moore was born into this world after her mother died giving birth to her after running off into the Darkwoods. Her father being burnt on the pyre for his sins, she is left to the mercy of her family. All her life she has been told to stay out of the Darkwood, the forest surrounding the city, where evil and the souls of the witches live. Years later, Immanuelle is lured into the woods, starting a bloody chain of plaques onto the land. She has to find a way to stop the plaques and the prophet before it is too late.I hated the ending of this book. That is why it only got four stars. Immanuelle is better than I. I would have left all their butts to die. I am petty like that. I might have saved my man depending on how I felt about that day.
