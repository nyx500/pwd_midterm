-3.5 ‚≠ê- This book is a very modern 2020 witchy tale. I find this book to be entertaining and I love the dark forest atmosphere. As I read, I thought of the movie The VVitch -not just a family but a whole town. Men are good (light) while women are widely condemned (darkness). The villain is an old pedo Prophet with many wives, a fraud in the name of the Father. One of many ways for young girls to remove sin is to become his bride (chuckles at the hypocrisy). You know what, it's fine! After all, it's dark fantasy. If you're a male with sin, then you're sh!t out of luck, into the pyre you go. The author said this book fills in that gap between YA and adult, a crossover so I was hoping for a dark, disturbing, and scary read. It left me wanting a little more. The Year of the Witching is totally a YA book. If your heroine who "saves the world" is 16 years old... to me that's YA.
