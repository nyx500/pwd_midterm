imagine if the new sabrina series followed prudence instead of sabrina. that’s the year of the witching. anyways, this story felt so fresh and is truly a perfect autumn read. it’s deliciously spooky and eerie, definitely akin to the creepier parts of the new sabrina series. i do think it’s weird that people don’t think this is horror?? not every horror novel needs to scare the pants off of you to be part of the genre - have yall never read gothic horror or classics like dracula??
