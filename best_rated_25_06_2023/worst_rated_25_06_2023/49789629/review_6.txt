i feel like this is one of those books where you either really love it or it just isnt for you. and being that my fatal flaw is indecisiveness, im right down this middle with this one. there are a lot of good things about this - the relevant themes, the relatable characters, and the easy-going writing. i like how this is set in a very distant and dated world, but so much of the story applies to reality. i love immanuelle as a character and i appreciate that she had a determined strength to her, but is also kind and thoughtful. i feel like i dont see enough of this combination in books. i also like her interactions with ezra and enjoy their narrative. that being said, this potentially could have benefited with a few more revisions. the world-building surrounding the witches seems to be lacking and the descriptions of the cities are confusing (this definitely could use a map). because of this, i felt myself focusing more on the side plot of the cult-like society and its leaders within the town, rather than the main plot of the witches and the curses from beyond. i also feel like this could have improved by embracing a more adult storytelling, as i think the YA vibes hold the story back from its full potential. so some good and some not so good but, overall, this is a pretty decent debut!â†  3.5 stars
