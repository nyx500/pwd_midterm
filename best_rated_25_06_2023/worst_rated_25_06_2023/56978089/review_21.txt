"There is a difference between living the suffering and reading about it."‚≠êüí´1.5 starsI read somewhere - likely on Twitter - that this book was inspired by The Descendant of the Crane. I certainly see it. The flowing prose, the vivid worldbuilding, the themes of family, betrayal and unravelling of difficult truths. I enjoyed The Descendant of the Crane, and for the same reasons I did like some aspects of A Magic Steeped in Poison quite a bit. Don't get me wrong - though I mention similarities, they are two different books that stand separately - firmly on their own strengths.I just wish the pacing of this book wasn't this much of a mess. Sure, the writing flows so smoothly that I almost felt as if I'd been swept away by a stream, but it was as though I was simply carried from plot point to plot point, never once immersed. It was hard to follow the story for this reason, and even harder to keep myself from losing interest.(The same could be said about the characters, even though I followed them for a greater part of 400 pages. It was as if I hadn't really met them at all? Ning especially - and she's the protagonist whose perspective we follow. It was like I thought I knew her, but she always acted the complete opposite of internal monologue. This could just be me - I was too distracted, fighting off my growing disinterest.)A Magic Steeped in Poison contains all the ingredients for a wonderful story. And, as I've mentioned, the writing had so much potential. But I won't lie and say I wasn't disappointed. As it stands, I'm not sure if I will be continuing on with this series. Still, I'm excited for the novel's debut. I'm absolutely certain that a lot of people will enjoy this. It was just not for me.Big thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for providing an ARC in exchange for an honest review.Content Warnings: assassination, death, disease, poison, violence.
