2 Stars Naturally the book with a beautiful cover, I don’t like…. I listened to the audio and at one pointy started skim listening as it wasn’t my cup of tea <— pun intended. I loved the idea of tea and myths but it just bores me. I’m not much into competition books any more either. And someone’s review said there was animal cruelty which you know I hate but I must have missed it in my skimming Either way, if you loved it great, if you didn’t, that’s great too. Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
