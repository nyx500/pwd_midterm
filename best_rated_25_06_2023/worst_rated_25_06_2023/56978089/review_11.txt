This one should have steeped a bit longer!A Magic Steeped in Poison has a great beginning and ending, but a bit of a confused middle part with some logic holes and things that made no sense to me, as if the author had not had the time to edit the middle as thoroughly as the rest. But the incredibly gorgeous cover makes this definitely worth buying even if you just want it as an art object, and the evocative prose and unique tea brewing magic system are its biggest strengths. Plot and characters didn't always convince me as much, especially the weak YA insta-romance,  and I hope they don't end up together because the protagonist does not deserve him! She kept distrusting him despite of *having put him under a truth spell* which meant he couldn't possibly have been lying, and she then expresses that distrust by saying the most hurtful things possible, the kind of words sure to stay with you for years. Eww, go get a nice girl, Kang!)Things I liked:- pretty prose and descriptions- cool magic system- female friendships- intense love for one's family- good build-up of tension and suspense- magical competition- interesting side characters I liked- entertaining, quick read that flows nicelyThings that didn't work for me:- some aspects of the story and setting don't really make sense when you think about it- some logical discrepancies- constant secrecy/lies/deception that usually seemed so unnecessary, I kept wondering why something had to be kept secret (e.g. mild spoiler, not a big deal: the emperor's death was kept secret for *two seasons*, with all of his servants locked up with him and forbidden from leaving or communicating with anyone, and then just as arbitrarily his death is openly announced and the locked-up servants aren't mentioned anymore, and nobody is upset about his decomposed body or the deception and nobody wonders why it was concealed) Another example would be when Ning is hanging out in the palace kitchen, which then has to be concealed for unknown reasons, leading to her pretending to be newly hired kitchen help, who's then forced to change into a maid dress and serve tea at a palace party (which would not be a kitchen help's job at all), just so she can conveniently discover something there (pure plot contrivance). These kinds of occurrences are just a bit farfetched and contrived, and don't feel well-thought-out.- romance is a little toxic (with the heroine being the toxic one for a change)- it felt a bit derivative of Elizabeth Lim's wonderful Spin the Dawn - too many gratuitous food descriptions for my taste (this might be a plus point for you, but I started rolling my eyes a bit at all the glazed things drizzled with this and that)- too many convenient coincidencesThis sounds as if I didn't enjoy it, but I'm actually still looking forward to the sequel - this is only a debut, and the author clearly has a lot of talent for beautiful prose and creating tension. With a bit more attention to more thoughtful plotting, characterization and world-building, she could become a favorite.
