1/25/2023Liked it less this time around. Still think it would have been better as a smutty adult romance because there is just not enough world building for this to be a good fantasy novel. Often, I felt as if characters existed in a vacuum. ________3.5 starsThis book, I would have preferred to read written for adults. It is mostly a romance, with a lot of talk of virginity, ravishing, tearing off dresses, etc. But because it's YA, despite being quite sensuous, it doesn't go further than kissing. Too bad really, I don't come across many good adult romances, and setup of "Cruel Beauty" is perfect for creating all kinds of convenient excuses to facilitate sexy times. I enjoyed mythology/fairy tale mix as well, although I got lost a little in it all by the end.
