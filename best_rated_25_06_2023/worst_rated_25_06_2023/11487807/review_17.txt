Ahmed has created a fascinating new fantasy setting with a rich feeling of its own history, but with enough parallels to our own world to make it easy to relate to its problems and peoples.Throne was a really fun read. Ahmed's prose style is fluid and accessible, and his villains are truly terrifying without going over the top and becoming cartoonish. Ahmed claims he wanted to bring back the feel of the Dragonlance or Forgotten Realms novels he loved when he was younger, and in this, he has succeeded.I would have liked this book to be another hundred pages or so, with more exploration into the characters and their motivations/love interests. The ending tied up most of the loose ends neatly, but I felt the book rushed to its conclusion.
