3Â½ starsA sword & sorcery fantasy set against an Arabian Nights backdrop. The story follows the paths of three unlikely characters: Adoulla Makhslood, an aging disgruntled mage and the last ghul hunter left in the city who's still hunting ghuls; Raseed bas Raseed, the mage's young pious protege who, unfortunately, has no magic of his own but has been blessed with great strength; and Zamia Badawi, a young gifted (but self-righteous) shapeshifter from a desert tribe who no longer has a home. These three are drawn together by circumstance--a powerful sorcerer is creating powerful ghuls and letting them loose to slaughter in the desert. For Adoulla and Raseed, it's their duty to rid the land of evil, but for Zamia the journey is one of vengeance and self-sacrifice. There's also a royal conspiracy plot running in the background.This is a fun story and I enjoyed it quite a bit. There's adventure, tension, humor, awkward first love, retirement jokes, fights over customs and ideologies, and a good amount of peril. The set-up reminds me somewhat of Peter V. Brett's The Warded Man but better executed--better plotted and better written overall. As the first of the trilogy, this book shows a glimpse of what the rest of the trilogy could be and there's a lot of potential here.
