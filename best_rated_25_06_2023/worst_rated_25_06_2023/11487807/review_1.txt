I love picking up a fantasy novel and reading something I haven't been exposed to before. With this book, that pleasure came from the fact that the world had some distinctly Arabian worldbuilding and cosmology. It's more than merely a different flavor to the same old story. It's not like the author just mad-libed out the generic European wizards and goblins and replaced them with Fakirs and Djinn. It's a different sort of world, complete with unfamiliar cultural values and superstitions. In terms of the overall story and character (Which is the meat of the matter) this one hovers somewhere between a four and a five. But the fact that it's the author's Debut novel, combined with the fresh Worldbuilding, nudge it up into the five star range with me. I'll be interested to see what Saladin comes up with next....
