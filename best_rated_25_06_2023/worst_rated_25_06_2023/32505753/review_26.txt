✅ Pace ✅ Gorgeous cover ✅ Politics and betrayal ✅ Magic ✅ Main character✅ A few twists✅ Kiss of distraction✅🆗 Plot (good, but mostly predictable) 🆗 Secondary characters 🆗 Kind of love triangle?❗️❗️ Trigger warnings: physical abuse, torture, and mention of rape.It’s safer to live only in the present, to be a girl with no past to yearn for and no future to have ripped away.Ash Princess is not an epic story, but it is a good YA fantasy book with a fast pace that makes it a real page-turner. It reminded me a little bit of a reversed version of The Winner's Curse. “We are not defined by the things we do in order to survive. We do not apologize for them,” she says quietly, eyes never leaving mine. “Maybe they have broken you, but you are a sharper weapon because of it. And it is time to strike.” After witnessing her mother's murder when the Kalovaxians invaded her country, Theodosia, the rightful heiress of the kingdom of Astrea, became a captive of the Kaiser. She’s been held in a golden cage for the past 10 years and has almost become complacent. She tries to please the Kaiser to stay alive and lives a quiet submitted life... until she can't anymore. Is it better to have your life ended by someone who hates you or someone who loves you? There is deception, betrayal, love, and a few twists in this book. Slavery and abuse are major themes in this story and it gives Ash Princess a darker note that I liked. It shows the reality of war prisoners and the fate of conquered people being forced into slavery. The world-building is well done, and I liked the magic system. Some people have elemental affinities, and they can use their powers if they have a Spiritgem. Each type of magic and gem gives a different set of affinities, going from being super strong to being able to craft illusions or heal. We did not see much of the magic though in this book, and I wish there will be more of it in the rest of the series.“The hope inside me is not smothered yet. It is dying, yes, with only a few embers left. But I’ve seen fires rekindled with less.” Theo is a good main character, even though she feels a little juvenile (it is a YA after all), and I am curious to see how she will mature in the next books because there is definitely room for growth for her and the other characters too. She is still young, and while she was a prisoner of the Kaiser, she also was sheltered from the harsh reality of her people for the past 10 years. Some of the characters are average, and they could have been a little more defined. I did not really get attached to Theo’s Shadows, and her relationship with Prince Soren was not surprising or unexpected at all, but I did enjoy her conflicted feelings for Cress. I will not anger the Kaiser and he will keep me alive. This is the rule I’ve learned to follow.Theo starts as a complacent prisoner and she grows into the would-be queen that is ready to start a rebellion and die in the hope of freeing her country and helping her people. I understand why she was so complacent at first, especially since she had no hope of escaping the Kaiser, but I much prefer the strong and determined Theo that we get to see in the second half of the book.There is a kind of love triangle between Theo, her childhood best friend, and the kind prince that I did not enjoy that much. I don't really get why it was added to the story, maybe it will become clearer in Lady Smoke. As I said, I do not care much for Blaise, Theo’s childhood friend, and if given a choice, I would go with Prince Soren, but after the way this book ended, I’m assuming that romance will not be as simple as Theo choosing one of the guys and live happily ever after.While being a captive in the palace, Theo befriended Cress, the daughter of the Kalovaxian General who killed Theo’s mother. Their relationship is a complex one that is not as simple as them finding an unexpected friend in each other. We can see as the story progresses that Cress sees Theo more as a friend that she can control, than a real friend. Cress does care about Theo, as long as Theo doesn't get in the way of Cress’ ambitions and plans. Theo cares about Cress because she is the only being who showed Theo kindness and tried to make her feel better, but she comes to realize that what they share is not a real friendship. There is definitely a lot of tension between them at the end of the book, and I can’t wait for them to face each other again in the next book.You’re a lamb in the lion’s den, child. You’re surviving. Isn’t that enough?The fact that the rightful and only heir to the throne was kept alive and paraded in court (even if she was a prisoner) did not make that much sense either, in my opinion. It would have been easier to kill Theo and remove any threat of rebellion, but it was necessary for the story to keep her alive I guess. The ending is promising, with a new shocking character being introduced, and I am also hoping for some pirate and sea adventure vibes in Lady Smoke. Overall, Ash Princess is well developed, and honestly, even though this book is nothing out of the ordinary and has a common storyline, it is a page-turner and a quick and entertaining read.“I was a princess made of ashes; there is nothing left of me to burn. Now it's time for a queen to rise.” Follow me on Instagram
