I picked up this book because my friends loved it and I wanted to follow their hype! Unfortunately it wasn’t for me. So much of the plot followed the standard YA fantasy checklist without adding anything new. What bumped this down to 2 stars for me is that I couldn’t stand the main character. For someone who has an entire country depending on her to reclaim their land, she does nothing other than act wishy-washy and indecisive. It drove me crazy that she kept on talking about having to kill people without actually doing it because she was stuck in her head so much. Even when it comes to conspiring treason, other characters had to guide her along and make the decisions for her. She played no active role at all, and I was so tired of being stuck in her head. Please, I’m begging you to make a decision for once in your life!!
