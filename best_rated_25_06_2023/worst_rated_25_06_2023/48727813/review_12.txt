(3.5) This book started so strong, I thought this was going to be a new favorite book and an easy five stars.Sadly, I had issues with the pacing (even had to go back a couple of times because I thought I had missed something). I wasn't invested in the political intrigue as much as I would have wanted.I did root for the romance (for once!) but nothing could have prepared me for the fisting scene XD
