[2022] had to bring my favorite book to see some of my favorite humans (it was a little too fitting... hehe) <3[2021] my favorite book of the whole year :]ARC provided by TOR - thank you so very much!this was truly so magnificent, and will for sure make my best books of 2021 list (if not my favorite book of the year, too)! but i truly am simply just a ouyang apologist. Content and Trigger Warnings: starvation, loss of a loved one, death, murder, mass murder, gore, war themes, brief mention of cannibalisms, hurt to an animal, death of an animal, mention of slavery, non-consensual castration in past, mention of vomiting, plague, mass illness, quarantining, off-page torture, bombs, many mentions of alcohol consumption/maybe alcoholism, off-page death of a child, depression depiction, fear of being outed, misgendering (always in a negative light), and just a lot of internalized body/gender feelings - this book can be heavy at times, so please use caution.
