MY REVIEW: 4.5 Stars ⭐️ I loved the main character, Zhu! She does whatever she has to do, disguising herself as her brother, to survive and make her claim to fame so to speak. (Turns out the seerer was correct, read the book) There are other wonderful characters in the book, even the villains are fleshed out nicely. And everyone in the the book has some kind of underlying issues. Some would say Zhu is a villain of sorts but she just does whatever she has to in this world and to me, I just can’t not like her! There are battles, I mean obviously. I would just recommend reading this book so you can meet some great characters for yourself. You just might find your next gem!  *I would like to thank Tor for offering me to read this book through, Netgalley. I’ve never been offered to read a book from Tor so I greatly appreciate it and that you to Netgalley. Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾BLOG:https://melissa413readsalot.blogspot....
