She Who Became the Sun is one of my Top 5 Anticipated Releases of 2021, and the first of those 5 that I've read. And I'm utterly delighted that it did not disappoint at all. A historical retelling that follows a lowly girl as she steals her brother's name and illustrious fate to rise from peasant to monk to military commander (and in the sequel, emperor), it is a book that shines with Zhu's desire for the fate of greatness. full rtc to come when it's not 2am. (will say I'm not entirely sold on the use of The Song of Achilles as a comp title and I wonder why they used it, as the only similarities are that they're both loose retellings with strong military aspects . . . also pretty queer . . . also some trauma and heartbreak that made me cry . . . okay maybe I see it, a bit)- still, my comps for this would be The Poppy War (determined heroines, military aspects, both influenced by Chinese history), Sistersong (both reimaginings with leads that engage with gender identity), and And I Darken (another historical reimagining where a prominent male leader is reimagined as a woman).  > 4.5 stars! *This contains SO MANY OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS that I’m vibrating of excitement - founding emperors!!- the Ming dynasty!!- (kinda) Ancient China!!- beautiful villain PINING AFTER A PURE PRINCE OH MY GOD- lots of long, billowing sleeves- it was comp’d to THE SONG OF ACHILLES so I’ll be crying in sorrow by the end I imagine- the author likes the untamed so they’re my favourite person now
