Hello friends, this contains content warnings for SHE WHO BECAME THE SUN.SHE WHO BECAME THE SUN is a book about gender identity (amongst other things). While the two genderqueer protagonists reflect aspects of my own experiences of genderqueerness, this doesn't mean these perspectives are necessarily affirming to any other LGBTQIA+ identifying persons. Please read the warnings if you're concerned, and take care of yourselves.Most violence occurs offscreen, and the level of depicted blood and gore is in line with that of your average 15+ historical TV drama.It is an adult book, not YA.Content warnings:* Dysphoria* Pre-existing non-consensual castration* Misgendering* Internalised homophobia* Life-altering injury (amputation)* Ableist language* Non-graphic depictions of death by torture* Major character death* Offscreen murder of a child* Scenes depicting extreme hunger/starvation* Graphic depiction of a person burning to deathIf you have read the book and believe additional warnings would be useful to the community as a whole, please contact me.
