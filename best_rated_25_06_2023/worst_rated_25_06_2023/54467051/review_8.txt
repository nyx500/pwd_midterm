Clark's "The Unbroken" is an epic fantasy about loyalty and picking sides. The main character Tourraine is a soldier off to help the Queen-to-be put down a rebellious colony. Like many other "Sands," Tourraine is returning to her birthplace from whence she was stolen as a child and trained to be a soldier for the Empire. Here, her loyalties are tested as she struggles with whether her loyalty lies with the Empire, her fellow indentured soldiers, or her birth people who she barely remembers. Her loyalties are further tested as she becomes the Princess' assistant, confidant, and lover. In this novel, their tragic romance seems natural as part of the story. Is her loyalty to the rebels, to her former fellow soldiers, or to the Princess? The Empire feels like the French Empire, particularly the names and the manner of address. The colony feels much like North Africa, particularly the desert climate and the Magic practiced by an unknown culture in the hills. But it is no more France he Morroco than Robert Howard's Stygia was Egypt or Aquilonia was medieval England. This is a novel that becomes more intense as it goes on with the stakes becoming higher and higher. And, there is at least a sequel in the works.
