The Unbroken is a dual POV epic fantasy that follows two women from very different backgrounds. One is a disgraced soldier of Qazali origin and the other is the future ruler of the Balladairan Empire. Touraine is saved from sure death for a crime she did not commit by Luca is exchange for being a pawn in her plan towards peach between the Qazali rebellion and the Balladairans. However Luca's version of peace is still a very much colonized version where even granting the people minimal rights is a power struggle, And Touraine having the most freedom she's ever had really has to grapple with her place in the world. All she knows is serving the empire in different roles. So it's interesting to read about her basically decolonizing her mind to reject the notions that have been programmed into her. Right now she's an outsider who has been tugged away from everything she knows and her Sands(fellow soldiers) she can relate to. There was a little point where it lagged in the middle while we get to know the characters more in the routine they've settled in. It does end up picking back up as Luca and Touraine battle each other on different sides. There's romantic tension between the two but it's not a sweet romance where they perfectly fit. Luca is the master and the one with dominant power which is something that can't be ignored. CL Clark does an great job describing the world of Qazal. I love fantasies where you can picture the town clearly and are given vivid descriptions of what people wore and ate. I also liked the parallels to the real life French Empire's rule over North Africa.I received an arc from Orbit Books in exchange for an honest review.Full reviewhttps://womenofcolorreadtoo.blogspot....
