"The rats on board carried away one of my sheep;""Care and vigilance, with a very common understanding, may preserve a manâ€™s goods from thieves, but honesty has no defence against superior cunning;"It seems that I had a completely incorrect opinion of what Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travel would be. To be fair, my prior opinion was solely based on the children's cartoon that I had watched years ago, but the book holds a shocking contrast to that easy going adaptation with a bunch of Lilliputians in every conceivable way. Okay may be the humor is still here, but this humor on human nature is coming from a more complicated level altogether.I'm not that used to these kind of satirical proses, so it took me a while to get used to things. At first, I was a somewhat confused as to why would the author be using such a complex prose for a children's book, but it quickly became apparent that this is even beyond the average YA book. Swift's witty remarks on general human conduct alone are quite complex, and he's not holding back in conveying his observations about society at that time, even resorting to several offensive comments.The book is a compilations of four different adventures, though, each subsection is identical in the sense that Gulliver getting shipwrecked each time to be followed by arriving at an island populated by a strange civilization and proceeding to learning their culture and languages, providing a detailed description about the inhabitants encountered using Gulliver's POV. This, in my opinion, had been done in a masterful way, not once betraying the fact that Gulliver's perspective is not authentic. However, the identical sequence of events occurring after the initial encounter does start to feel repetitive after a while, making the book more of a 3-star read. But, since all this helped me to reminisce about the time I got to watch the cartoon a long time ago, I couldn't help but add another star."Whoever could make two ears of corn, or two blades of grass, to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians put together.""Truth always forces its way into rational minds,"
