This was my favourite classic growing up, and don't ask me why! Re-reading it as an adult didn't really feel like a book a child would like but oh well, I guess I liked all that poop and pee talk! I am not a fan of satire and political science, I also think that it's almost impossible to fully understand a book like this which is so deeply rooted in the society it was written into, but overall I think it's still very enjoyable for a modern reader, and an important - albeit weird - classic of literature. The absurdity of the society Swift describes, the imagination he's capable of and the crazy ideas he put into this work still amaze me after re-reading this for at least the third time! This is probably one of those weird books that everybody loves but you just can't quite pinpoint the exact reason why. Maybe because we're all a little gullible deep down... üòè
