imagine if you lived in the 1700s and this was like...the most fun book available.screaming and crying.so grateful to live in a time when the only reason i read this book is because its cover is pretty, and not because i live a life of suffering and no running water and my idea of a raging good time is...this.phew.bottom line: this was fine, that's all.
