I picked this up to do a re-read. Out side of the Lilliput part of the story, I remember little about this. I read it over 20 years ago.The book is several different stories told by Gulliver on his wild travels. They are: 1. Lilliput - the most famous one people know this story for2. Brobdingnag - the opposite of lilliput. He goes to a land of giants3. Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib and Japan4. HouyhnhnmsIf this book had just been about Lilliput and Brobdingnag - it would have been a 4 star read for me, but taking the whole into account and it's barely 3 stars. There are weird things that happen all through this story. In Lilliput, the royal quarters are set on fire and Gulliver rushes to helps. He urinates on the building to put out the fire. The queen is so upset about this that they want to blind Gulliver. The first two parts are interesting. Starting in Part 3, things get very slow and somewhat miserable. Jonathan is a wonderful writer and that is something, but it was miserable trying to get through the end. I can't believe I got through this as a kid. By the time we were in the land of the Houyhnhnms and he was describing the hair around their beasts anus and their utters, I was just done. It was horrible. The end became a torture. I was so glad to be done with this book. I'm surprised I don't give it a lower star. I know this is supposed to be satire, but I don't know what was happening back in the 1700s enough to get the references. I can't really enjoy the satire. One thing, I will never read this book again. If anyone asks. If you know European history and love Satire, then you might enjoy this book. All others should read the first two parts and put the book down.The last two parts would be a good torture devise for someone you don't like. Just make them listen to it.
