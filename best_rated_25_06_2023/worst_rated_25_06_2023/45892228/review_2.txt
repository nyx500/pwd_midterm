I tried, I really did.But this was just so cliche that it HURT. There was no way I could make my way through 600 pages of this. The fact that the main character was like "ugh gross, I'm not like the other girls in a YA romance" made my soul cringe. Plus, it's just weird to me that the MC and the vampire went from being rude to one another to literally two seconds later on top of each other rubbing each others faces. Like, y'all are strangers! What's happening?! I have got to go.Blog | Twitter
