Damn it!! I was hoping to love this book so I could buy them and have them on my shelves and blah blah!! This is NOT like Twilight. I love Twilight with a passion! The movies more than the books but I love both. I love the idea of all the supernatural creatures in the book other than vamps and werewolves and witches. I mean freaking dragons and gargoyles are enough and then finding out what the main girl is, I might read the next one just to see. I’m just super ass mad because I want this book and this story to be more. Whatever!! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
