2.5 starsThis started out strangely, continued that way for a while, then went really downhill.Nathan was someone that I immediately felt quite sorry for. The way his mother , siblings, in fact everyone treated him from the time he was a new-born was just disgusting and awful. How anyone can treat a poor defenceless baby that way I don’t know. Poor Nathan just got tormented, put down, and generally mistreated his entire life.This book for me seemed to be about racism? I might have that wrong, but on a very basic level that’s what it seemed to be about. There were the white witches and the black witches, and the ‘half-codes’ – those people who were half and half were treated like treated like vermin. Nathan’s life seemed to go from bad to worse, and the things that happened to him were just unforgivable.This book was written a little oddly though, the writing style was quite unusual, and while I appreciated the fast pace, we hit a bit at around the 60% mark which was just boring and felt like it would never end!There was a hint of romance in this, but not a lot. I wanted things to work out for Nathan and Annalise, but because she was a white witch and Nathan was a half-code, that seemed to be worse than Romeo and Juliet.The ending to this was okay, and I was pleased that Nathan did finally get something that he wanted. I can’t believe that his life is going to be much better from now on though.5 out of 10
