2.5, because oh, who am I fooling, it's a 2 and that's it.I'm sorry, but I'm afraid this review will be terribly short. The reason? Take the title and replace the word "Half" with "Totally". Here you have my review.But, as I'm sure you know by now, I wouldn't be at peace with myself if I didn't at least try to explain why.• The pace is off, off, off. Pages in which nothing happens, others in which the hell happens, but my attention is already drifting in a sea of "let's guess how much f**k I give between none and none minus the number of pages of this book".•The writing tries to be original, but actually it's simply dull. Criminally dull.•The characters are duller than the writing, and that takes talent. With one exception: Annalise. She manages to be disgustingly annoying with just three or four scenes she's in. That takes talent too.•The world building: the world is divided between fains (muggles, that is), Black Witches and White Witches. The White Witches hunt the Black because they think they are bad.Uh-uh. Sorry, I think I missed the part where I had to be impressed and clap my hands in delight.•The only thing I liked? Nathan's childhood is depicted like a hellhole. In this, Sally Green succeded perfectly: no drama, no sentimentalism, just a crude and harsh description of the facts. But, I'm sorry, I can't bring myself to care for a character or his whole book only by virtue of his past. I need more. I needed more. And this book just didn't comply.
