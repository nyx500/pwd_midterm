Half Bad is a young adult fantasy novel that seeks to be "grittier" than typical YA fare. It succeeds, in part, but is bogged down by the typical angst-y relationships and fairly predictable plot.I think most readers agree that the opening is the best part of Half Bad. It is a bit of a downhill ride from there.
