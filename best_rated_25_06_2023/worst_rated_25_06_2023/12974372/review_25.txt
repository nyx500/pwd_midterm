4.25*Getting my books out of boxes, and sorting them out, I landed on this one and couldn’t resist diving back in.Picture a world similar to Victorian England but one where some types of ‘dragons’ exist, and I mean the reptile kind and not the more fantastical ones. Now zoom in a young girl who is fascinated by the natural world and wants to study it, problematic since women are only allowed to become wives in this society, and you’ll have an idea of the story.Brennan gives us an amazing character in that of Isabella, the titular Lady Trent, one full of sass, intelligence and drive, and we witness in this book her origins and first expedition. As much as I enjoyed this, it is the voice that totally captivated me, the author blending the young Isabella with the much older Lady Trent, the result being charming and sharp at the same time. What else? From someone who’s read the whole series, it gets better and better! ;O) P.S: The paperbacks have wonderful illustrations by Todd Lockwood peppered throughout. Why don’t novels have more of these as a general rule?P.P.S: The audio read by Kate Reading is brilliant! She literally becomes Lady Trent. Wonderful :O)
