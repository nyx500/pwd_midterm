4.75*Lovely book, a total surprise. It was an easy read that really grabed my attention and was hard to put down. I loved the world, that was very "normal", with normal animals and a normal society ressembling the 19th century. Sometimes it felt almost like I was reading a goood historical fiction... with dragons! I don't usually read a lot of books about dragons, but in this one they were nicely imagined and described and fit very well in the story. The prose was beautifully written and had really nice nature descriptions, like the forests or the night sky. Once again, also loved the 1st person, one POV, since I've been reading too much multiple POV's lately. The main characters personality, which most of the time felt "misplaced", was a really strong part of the story to me - she doesn't let society's chains keep her from doing what she loves to do, and ends up becoming a successful science woman. I think that's a very important message. Also loved the fact that her brothers, father and then her husband were supportive of her "strange" hobbies and dreams, unlike her mother - society's prejudices towards women sometimes come from women themselves, and not always from men. However, I guess I don't give this book a full 5* for two reasons:- I wish there was a little more depth and development to some of the other characters - I understand this is a 1st person POV, so Isabella knows how she feels but doesn't know how others feel. Still, I think her character was very well developed while the other fell a little too flat sometimes;- The way the dragons (and other wild life) was sometimes killed (almost casualy as if it were nothing) bugged me a little, and I have to admit that's a bit of a down side to me. But overall it was a very good book that i really enjoyed reading. Would definitely recomend!
