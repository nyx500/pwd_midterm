Everything in this book is so CLEAN! I loved that. You have to understand, I had a "thing" for utopian societies in high school. BRAVE NEW WORLD, THIS PERFECT DAY, HARRISON BERGERON . . . oh, yes! I've read them all. And what struck me about some of them was that it was supposed to be the perfect, future society, but everyone just seemed so sweaty . . . But not so in the Society. Everything is carefully sanitized. Clothes are clean, or quickly changed when they are not. The world has been cleaned up: there are only one hundred poems left, one hundred paintings . . . because too many choices, too many THINGS contributed to the confusion of their ancestors (us, in short). The world has been streamlined, recycled, and recreated into this sterile perfection, and it fascinated me. I loved the fact that Cassia feels like things are spiraling out of control, and they are, for her. But she continues to eat her specially prepared meals, continues to go to work and to the school, so the temptation to succumb, to go back to the dreamy calm of no choices and no worries is always there. The reader wonders until the last page: what will she do? Will the Society pull her back in, or will she rebel? Her dilemma is artfully done, and there is appeal in both of her choices. It was what kept me reading, along with the flawlessness of this serene Society which Ally Condie has created.So, this book has been heavily promoted. (I should be so lucky as to have PR like this!) And with that comes the fear that the book itself isn't very good, just the PR team. Well, have no fear, my people! The book is worth the hype. This is 1984 for teens, and it works. Also, I myself am not a "romance" person, particularly when it comes to YA. I will admit there have been other books in which my eyes rolled so much I feared they would fall out. I loved the romance in this one, I thought it was very natural and very well done.Two thumbs way up for Ally and MATCHED! Can't wait for the sequel!
