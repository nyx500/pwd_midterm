This book defiantly surpassed all my expectations...Thats probably the reason im giving this a 5. i loved the dystopic theme and the strong character buiding the author decided to follow on .But again,Yes,there's no denying.i did find the plot moving to a bit to slow, but then again the book's great narration and unpredicated ending,defiantly made it self up to me .all in all..not a bad read ! will definatly be checking out the rest of the series soon.And yes, this book will be going into the set of "My favourites" , what can i say ? LOL i just liked it better than "HUNGER GAMES" ;D Cant wait for the movie to be out anyway ! ♥
