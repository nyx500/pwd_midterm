1.5 starsUsually I can power through a crappy book and make it to the end but man oh man I just couldn't do it with this damn book.I feel like this entire book was just an intro for the rest of the series. A super. Long. Dragged out. Intro. The conflict was introduced but nothing ever really happened with it. All of the sudden she's in love, like what? Just not a fan. 1.5 stars only bc I like the writing style, the content was lacking
