i am about to tell you the least surprising thing ever:i was one of those kids who ate lunch in the english teacher's classroom in middle school.her name was Ms. Costello, she was like probably 25 years old and had a specific intense celebrity crush i can't remember, and she once told us all in passing that you should put lotion on while your skin is wet and i ascribed to her philosophies so intently that i now cannot physically tolerate the sensation of lotion on dry skin.she is important to me and i would die for her. unrelatedly, i haven't even seen her in passing in 10 years and i have no idea what she's up to.anyway. there were maybe 3-4 girls who lunched with Ms. Costello, and we used to take books from her in-class library all the goddamn time. teacher's pet privilege pays.this is one that we all read, like we were a love-starved pubescent micro-book club. we basically exclusively read dystopian stuff with love triangles, and we lived for it.i loved this then (because it met my singular standard of Girl Like Me Is Adored By Multiple Hot Teenage Boys), but i reread it later and. well. didn't.didn't reread it AND didn't love it.but i still have the memories! <3again, part of a project i'm doing where i tell you all i'm reviewing books i read a long time ago but i trick you into learning about me.
