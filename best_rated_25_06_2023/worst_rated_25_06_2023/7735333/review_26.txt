Yes, I am aware I have read this way too many times4 stars This is a beautiful work of art. Here's why I liked this book: Cassia made her own choices. She did what she thought was right. Let's look at Katniss. Katniss was the mockingjay because people told her that's what she needed to be. Cassia took a step back and saw the flaws in her own system. Nobody had to tell her. True, her grandfather helped her, but look at her father. Cassia's father loved the Society. He thought it was perfect and Cassia could have just stayed with her father and nothing would have happened.I could go on and on about how this book is different from the hype. Yes, it has a love triangle, and yes it has a standard government, but here's the difference: Cassia was her own person because she wanted to be.
