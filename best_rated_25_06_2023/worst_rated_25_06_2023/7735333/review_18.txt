Really disliked it. I found it espcially hard to believe in her love for (insert forgotten name) as she barely knew him and all that napkin stuff was really cringy. Didn't feel for the guy at all, since all he seemed to want was for somebody to feel sorry for him. I would have prefered it if she'd fallen in love with her best friend but been given a different match. The fact that the matches were so sucessful most of the time was the biggest let down for me. I also disliked how 'deep' we were supposed to think she was just because she liked some poems. I found it really difficult to believe she could have any real appreciation of words growing up in that kind of society. People were far too happy with the situation. While the premise is interesting it doesn't live up to its potenial. I would have prefered a little more unhappiness in the society, not much, just a few more whispers behind closed doors. Also, barely anything actually happened in the story, till the very end and it was chock full of flashbacks-most of them irrellevant! The amount of times she brought up her grandfather was shocking, ok they had a close relationship-I get it! Urgh.
