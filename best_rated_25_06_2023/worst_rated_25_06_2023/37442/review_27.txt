Alas, I'm getting rid of this book to make room for others. no ... my wife took it, read it, loved it, kept it! I really can't recommend any book more highly than I do this one! Take it to the beach! okay, I will admit that I have no idea about how someone who has no idea what The Wizard of Oz story is about would react to the book ...This is a great read, in my opinion far better than the follow-up books he wrote. Everyone is familiar with the story of The Wizard of Oz, and Maguire has such a fantastic idea of writing the life story of a rather minor, though important, character in that tale. Not only that, but from an utterly frightening, "bad" character in the former story, he has morphed her into someone who we are very sympathetic towards, and who we care about deeply (at least I did). This was one of my very favorite books of the few years around the time that I read it.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Previous review: What the Numbers SayNext review: The Ecotechnic FutureMore recent review: The Death of VishnuPrevious library review: Streets of LaredoNext library review: The Fixer Malamud
