Jar of Death Pick #38I finally finished it! I started this book way back in 2020 but I quickly realized I wasn't in the mood for it, so I did a soft DNF. I wanted to pick it up several times between then and when I actually finished it but I knew I wasn't in the right mood yet. For me timing is everything. Wicked is the "true story" of the life and times of the late great Wicked Witch of the West. As I read this over the last week or so, I realized something....I really like stories set in the world of The Wizard of Oz. I've read and watched several such pieces of media....and yet I've never read the original book series. How is it that I've watched 3 different silent movie versions of Oz but I've never read the original???I've even watch that awful movie Oz the Great and Powerful(I think that's the name but I don't care enough to check) but I've never read the original book??? Anyway back to Wicked.I think I would have enjoyed this more if I hadn't seen the musical. That musical is perfection and the book just pales in comparison. Not to say this isn't a good book because it is. It's just not the musical. I also think part of my problem with book is that I don't really vibe with Gregory Maguire's writing style. I can't put my finger on what bothers me about but something does. I own another book by him, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister and I think I'll read that to further flesh out my thoughts. Overall I did like this book, Elphaba was such an interesting and cool character. Depending on how I feel after read that other Maguire novel I might pick up the other book in this series.
