GREEN EDGES.Is it normal that it makes me so excited?One week later.Maybe the green edges set too high expectations.I may or may or may not have skimmed through he last 150 pages (out of 520).And now I really don't know what to say about this.The writing is very rich, substanstial, and ther story seems, initially, to absorb such qualities itself, but right after you close the book you just know that, actually, it left you nothing. And while I know -I experienced- that this story is anything but flimsy, I wonder what went wrong. It's not even that I found it boring as many reviews say, it just told me nothing.I think I will pick this up again in the future. But this time around, it uninterested me so much that I am speechless. For the wrong reasons.
