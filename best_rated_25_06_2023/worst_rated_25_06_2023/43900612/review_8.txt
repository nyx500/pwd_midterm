“Do not be silent. Raise your voice. Be a light in the dark.”Wowwww this was so amazing that i cant even put it into words😭😭 It engages feminism, homophobia and lies in such a way that it's not only intriguing but beautiful!I loved the main character and I could relate to her throughout the story. She grows up seeing her world through a perspective that is proved to be made up. She's fighting every form of prejudice put her way but will she succeed??What's the price to knowing the full truth??I love this retelling because there's absolutely no prince charming! Instead we get a wholesome Sapphic romance because Kalynn is that queen!Our main character is feminist, lesbian and bad ass, what's not to love? Tbh, if you loved Cinderella don't read this. It might disturb you a bit because this Cinderella retelling is dark and deep.Once again, this author has given me a beautiful story and a beautiful cover. I stan!
