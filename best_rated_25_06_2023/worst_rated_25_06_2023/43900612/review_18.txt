I LOVED THE PLOT TWISTS!, THEY WERE LIKE YASSSS! I also loved all the characters!, they were awesome! except for prince charming! 👀🔪 U'll see why! 👀 ~The Plot~The book started with Sophia and Erin somewhere near the palace i think. They ran when they thought the guards were after them! Sophia went to town to get her dress for the ball fitted. Some stuff happened in the middle that i don't think was that important. Sophia went to the ball with Erin, and they had a fight in the carriage! (ALL ERIN'S FAULT!) They got to the ball, and this guy Sophia's mom had asked to take to lace shop before said that he'd marry her, and then they would runaway. BUT that didn't work out, cause Sophia's friend Liv was taken away by the king because she was underdressed (later she was killed🔪🔪) Anyway the guy she was gonna marry was taken away, and Sophia ran away. Where she met Constance ❤️ and Sophia and Constance went places to try to figure out how to stop the king aka prince charming, on there there way they also met Amina aka the fairy godmother. IT'S AWESOME!, THE PLOT'S AWESOME! i couldn't find the right gif (it's suppsed to say this is awesome right?), so this is apparently the closest i could find or not idk~My Thought's on the Plot~I really enjoyed the plot!, it didn't go too fast or too slow which I liked cause nowadays i seem to read books where the plot starts by going slow and then it keeps a good pace which annoys me a lot!, so this is was good cause the plot went at the same pace throughout the book! And overall the whole story was enjoying and engaging!, the characters were all awesome too!, except for one person!, who hopefully know's who he is 🔪 (This so weird it's prince charming!)~Plot Twists~I'm adding this for some reason! :) this is one reason this review is in the full spoiler thingy! DO NOT READ THIS PART IF U HAVE NO READ THE BOOK PLS!THE PLOT TWISTS WERE SOOOOO UNPREDICABLE!, LIKE SERIOUSLY!1. PRINCE CHARMING'S EVIL! (WOAH, i want to kill him so bad)2. AMINA PRINCE CHARMING'S MOTHER! (WHAT THE HECK?!!!)3. The evil step mother's are not evil (This was not the most surprising plot twist but it still surprising)4. PRINCE CHARMING killed Cinderella's mother (when i found out it left me hanging like why did cinderella marry prince charming then? why cinderella? she was charmed into marrying him“It's risky...But sometimes that's the only way to get things done. Take the risk, light the fuse. Onward.”~Characters~SophiaSHE'S BADASS!, I LOVE HER!, SO BRAVE! (I need to chill with the caps since there will be a lot more caps are u read along) I really, really love how brave she is!, i love it so much!, (I also need to chill with the love!, because she's not the only one who's supposed to get that!) I really liked that she was outgoing, and didn't like being confined, to a destiny she didn't want!, I admire that bout her a lot!, it was one of the quality's i extremly liked! “And you're not lost?""Maybe I am. But the difference is that I want to be found. I'm not happy pretending everything is fine when I know it's not.""And just who is it that you suppose will find you?""It'll be me. I will find myself.”ErinI PRETTY MUCH HATE HER! She's so annoying, and just because she is not brave enough to run away doesn't mean she has to pull Sophia down with her! Ugh! ERIN I'M SORRY ACTUALLY I'M NOT BUT U DON'T DESERVE SOPHIA! U PULL HER DOWN. Plus Erin wants to be normal. DOESN'T SHE KNOW NORMAL IS BORING ERIN STAND UP FOR URSELF! pls don't make me pity u “We are all trapped here, our stories already written.”ContanceI LOVE HER!, I LOVE ALL OF HER!, HER PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING, okay i need to chill, she's is very brave, and i really like that about her like so much!, I love her energy!, and how she kinda helped Sophia after she ran from the ball. that was so sweet!, btw i starting shipping them form that part! ❤️ She went through a though-ish childhood, and there she was being so good, and cool! SHE'S AWESOME!, LIKE SERIOUSLY AWESOME! Prince CharmingI HATE HIM WITH ALL MY BURNING PASSION. I HATE HIM SO MUCH!, HE'S THE WORST!, HE IS ONE REASON WHY I HATE MOST FANTASY KINGS!, THERE ALL (NEARLY ALL) EVIL! 🔪🔪🔪 FIRST HE TRAPPED CINDERELLA, NEXT HE MADE WOMAN HAVE NO POWER AND LASTLY HE TRIED TO MAKE SOPHIA DIE A SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH! I ALSO THINK I GENERATE NEGATIVE ENERGY TO HIS SUROUNDINGS. Amina aka Fairy Godmother(PLS SAY THIS HER NAME, IM GONNA BE SUPER EMBARRASSED IF I FORGOT HER NAME) I have no idea how to feel bout her. dO I like like her? do i not like her? i have no idea, i also have no idea why i included her, i have no idea how i feel bout her. let's try again. I always had this weird sneaky feeling that she wasn't really telling Sophia and Constance who she fully really was!, and i was right! SHE WAS PRINCE CHARMING'S MOTHER, when they reunited~Ending~The ending was brilliant and also sucked at the same time, it was mostly those last 20 pages of the book!, that made me feel things, that were not supposed to be felt. like seriously it broke part of me, but it also me, want to throw the book as far away as i could throw. such a weird feeling, so weird. ~Romance~From the beginning, for some reason this never happens, but i never shipped Sophia and Erin, usually if someone likes someone i ship them and if one of the someones changes i change my ship. I'm pretty sure barely made any sense but pls go with it, but in this book it never happened cause i never shipped Sophia and Erin! I WILL ALWAYS TOTALLY SHIP SOPHIA AND CONSTANCE! THEY WERE MEANT TO FIND EACH OTHER!<3 OH!, AND WILL NOT SHIP CINDERELLA AND PRINCE CHARMING!, IN THIS BOOK!, CAUSE PRINCE CHARMING EVIL!, HE TRIED TO HURT MY POOR SOPHIA! AND NOBODY HURTS SOPHIA! 🔪🔪🔪🔪 BUT CINDERELLA GOOD! “I don't want to be saved by some knight in shining armour. I'd like to be the one in the armour, and I'd like to be the one doing the saving.”~Overvall~Overall, this book was awesome!, and this was a very awesome cinderella retelling, and it was within my standards, cause cinderella is my favorite fairy tale, so i kinda did have high expectations for this, and it pretty much hit them. Also the plot twists were awesome, like so much!, LASTLY GO READ THIS BOOK IS AWESOME, U'LL LOVE IT HOPEFULLY U WILL! PLS LOVE IT!~Reactions~btw i like putting reactions, cause i find the gifs soo funny, and i have a gifs on reviews obsession and i need to feed it somehow!This kinda also has spoilers, so u probably shouldn't read this part either if u haven't read the book yet pls, this is for u not to get spoiledPrince Charming's EvilCinderella Married Him Even Though He Was EvilPrince Charming Killed Cinderella's MotherThe fairy godmother aka Amina is prince charming motherCinderella's evil step-sisters weren't really evilWhen prince charming was trying to hurt Sophia------------------------------------------AS MY FIRST CINDERELLA RETELLING I READ THIS GOOD!I LOVED AND HATED THE LAST 20 PAGES OF THE BOOK SO MUCH!ALSO I HOPE THAT CONSTANCE AND SOPHIA END UP TOGETHER!
