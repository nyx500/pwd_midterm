I thoroughly enjoyed the first few chapters of this book, I was instantly captivated and moved by the authors powerful words that held true not just within the story.I did feel as though the story began to fall a little flat after the initial world building and character constructions (which were fantastic) but I enjoyed the narrative and the inclusivity of the story. I loved the re-imagination of the classic tale and was left feeling inspired.
