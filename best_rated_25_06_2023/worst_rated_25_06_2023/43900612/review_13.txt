This was so exciting!! I want to get alternate stories of all the popular Disney stories, where like this one the villains are completely unexpected. Sofia found out the hard way that Cinderellaâ€™s story is not the happy fairytale we all know. They live in a kingdom where women are treated so horribly, and she has recognized this for basically all her life. I could feel her passion for trying to change this and this made the adventure a really fun one to read. I also enjoyed the twists we got here and there throughout the book. There was definitely a lot of creativity exuding from this book and we love to see it!!
