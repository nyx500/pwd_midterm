This was a BR with:the potato DJ Khaled Solohoe (I'm exposing you traitor)OH WHY YES, A BUDDY READ THAT ACTUALLY WORKED OUT WITH A BOOK I ACTUALLY REALLY ENJOYED AND WILL PROBABLY BE REREADING THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THAT ENDING IS SO BEAUTIFUL, I NEED MORE OF IT. OH LOOK, I ALREADY FEEL LIKE REREADING THIS GEM OF A BOOK. I'M SUCH GARBAGE FOR THE BEAST. This book is so beautiful and magical and I can't get over it. This book takes its time in explaining the world building and the ABSOLUTELY HEART WRENCHING RELATIONSHIP between Beauty and the Beast. I'm so glad this buddy read actually worked out with me and I actually really ended up enjoying a book in a buddy read. This rarely happens oml even though I finished it without two of my BR partners. The reason why this ended up being a successful BR is because I didn't choose the book. WHENEVER I CHOOSE A BOOK, IT ALWAYS ENDS UP BEING TRASH AND MY BR NEVER WORKS OUT WITH ANYONE. Yeva is a girl who wants nothing more than to be hunting in the forest alongside her father. She doesn't want to be getting married off to some handsome rich guy, but simply being out in the woods where she can be free and do what brings her happiness. When Yeva's father falls under a debt to pay, they have to sell their house and move out into the woods and survive the cold, hard winter. Yeva's father hunts for them also mumbling about a magical creature in the woods out there for him. So when one day, he disappears *poof bye bye* Yeva goes searching for him and the mysterious creature her father was talking about before he disappeared. I really really liked this retelling because it is unlike any I've ever read before. (This is probably my second one???) The thing that makes this retelling so unique is that the Beauty is the deadly one here and all she wants to do is hunt down the beast. She is brutal and thirsty for the blood of this beast. She wants nothing more than the satisfying death of this creature and to return home, but SPOILERS and SPOILERS. I really liked her character as well. She's badass, she wears dresses, she loves her sisters and dog. She is kind and loving and that doesn't mean she's a rude ass bitch, which is honestly so refreshing from all these YA badass heroine tropes. ⚔Also the relationship between Yeva and her sisters was so amazing. The love the sisters had for each other and the will to sacrifice their happiness for each other to an extreme extent was so real and beautiful.⚔Also the amount of attention the dogs get in this book is so amazing as well. I loved how the dogs played an important role and how they were treated with love and like family. I love Doe Eyes sm. I loved how the author took her time in explaining the world building. It's not rushed, there is no info dumping. The book is really slow paced and it takes its time in revealing everything at once and it's done super well. Usually slow paced plot, and world building bother me, but this book does it really well and again, I'm surprised at how much I enjoy it. The relationship between Yeva and the Beast is so well done and beautiful, I might have screamed for ten minutes straight. What stopped me from giving this 5 stars was that sometimes the story got really dull at a certain point. It is full of magic and beauty (ahahaha... okay i'll just laugh by myself), but it doesn't really have that much dialogue in it. I like my books with lots of dialogue, but it even though there wasn't much of it in this book, it didn't bother me that much and I still ended up liking it. The lack of dialogue in this book made the book sort of dull and bland at certain points for me, but like I said, IT WAS STILL REALLY GOOD OKAY. I also ended up predicting something major, though I'm not really sure it's major? I KNEW BEAST WAS IVAN/EOVANI also loved the whole message of happiness and wanting in this book. It's so real, heartbreaking, and beautiful, my heart hurts. ***Major spoilers from here on now, so if you haven't read the book, DON'T READ THIS PART***POOPPOOPOkay, can we please talk about the beast?? He is the most cutest, frustrating, adorable and sweetest piece of shit on earth and my fucking heart hurt SO BAD for him. I hated how he was hurting and HIS FEELS FOR BEAUTY OH MY LORD. THE FUCKING CUTEST THINGS ON EARTH, I'M SCREAMING. I WANT TO STEAL THE BEAST AND PET HIS FUR AND HUG HIM ALL DAY AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.AND THAT ENDING??? OH MY GOD, THAT FUCKING ENDING HAS ME SO HURT. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL AND SATISFYING, YET IT STILL FEELS INCOMPLETE??? Even though Yeva and Eovan get their happily ever after, I'm still not satisfied. I don't know, but I was expecting something more? OVERALL, Y'ALL SHOULD READ THIS.
