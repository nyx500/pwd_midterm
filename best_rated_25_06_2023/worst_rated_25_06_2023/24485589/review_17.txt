I wouldn't say I've had the best of luck with books that are re-telling fairytales. So, to be honest, I didn't have the highest hopes for this one. But I was quite impressed. It was more adventure than overly fairytale, in my opinion. I really loved Beauty. She is not a helpless girl, who needs to be saved- she is a brave and skilled tracker and hunter. The ending felt a bit rushed to me, aside from that, I'm fairly happy with the story overall and would recommend it to anyone who likes fairytale/adventures.
