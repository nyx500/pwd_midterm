This is a story about a brave maiden. This is a story of a tragedy. This is a story about the power of love. This is a story about the compassion and love and sacrifice between siblings. This is a story about selfishness and selflessness. This is the story of the greatest sacrifice. This is a story about life. “Beware the goblin men and the wares they sell.”This book is magical. The writing is exquisite. The world is so encompassing and real. The characters are flawed and selfish and selfless and strong, so so strong.There’s so much passion and love and fire and emotion. The book winds you up in its magic and takes you on this rollercoaster that you can’t get off even if you wanted to ((which let’s be real, you don’t want to))I am absolutely enchanted. I am absolutely shattered and heartbroken and mourning. Someone help me this book has exceeded my highest expectations and ended on a note that I cannot bear. W O WOkay, I have no more words beyond that I’m going to go sob for a while and get dehydrated over it. That’s how good it is. I’m legit out of words. “She was the sun and he was the earth waking from a thaw.”5 stars!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Buddy read  with Jianamin
