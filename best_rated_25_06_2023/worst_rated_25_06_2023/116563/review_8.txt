When the young readers in my acquaintance complain that there aren't more Harry Potter books to read, I like to suggest this series.I usually start the campaign with a few questions to get them interested."What if kid wizards couldn't tell their families about their powers?""What if they had to risk their lives in secret to keep the world safe?"I find the pre-teen and teen characters in this series to be much more engaging and realistic than the self-centered, clueless and common sense-lacking characters found in much juvenile fiction.I also fell that the way Ms. Duane portrays courage, friendship, trust and sacrifice in these books teaches a positive lesson to the young readers in an entertaining (and almost subliminal) way.
