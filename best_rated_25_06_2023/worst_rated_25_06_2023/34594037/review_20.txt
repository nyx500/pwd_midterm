I loved this and am kind of mad at myself for waiting so long to read it! Sibling (twin) rivalry, magic school a la Harry Potter but queer inclusive and realistic, murder mystery, teen drama, an emotionally damaged hard drinking lady private investigator?? Every aspect was so well done and the writing was excellent and it made me cry and it surprised me! What more could you want? Also: excellent audiobook narration by Xe Sands and a perfect ending.
