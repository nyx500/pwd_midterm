3.5 Stars rounded up. Very solid read! This reminded me of a more mature, slightly less fantastical version of Harry Potter, mainly because of the fact this takes place in a school for magic. Our protagonist is what Potter fans would call a muggle, she has no magic, and she is contracted to investigate the murder of a professor at this wonderful School of magic, and what's her twin sister also works at. This had the obvious element of mystery, as we are trying to figure out who dunnit throughout. I was not surprised by the reveal at all, but still satisfied by how things wrapped up at the end. I would not be surprised if this became a series, as the ending seemed a bit open-ended. The characters were all incredibly flawed, yet likeable, which made this story that much more enjoyable to me. Even our 'villian' received my sympathy, and I really understood their motivations. This was a fast paced, above-average read IMO and I can understand how it made some beat of the year lists!
