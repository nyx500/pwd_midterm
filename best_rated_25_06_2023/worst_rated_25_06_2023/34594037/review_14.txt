This time was going to be different. This time was going to be better. This time, I was going to be enough.Like so many of us readers, Ivy Gamble never had the chance to go to magic school and experience a magical fix for everything wrong in her life. Unlike most of us, she's not really allowed to put the dream aside and move on with life - her twin sister does get that, from her teenage perspective, and when this story begins years later, she's now a hard drinking, hard living PI, who resolutely tells herself she never wanted that life anyway. And of course, it's not long before that world comes knocking on her door - in the best of traditions, there's been a murder, and it doesn't take long before the shimmering promise of a perfect, magical, life is within Ivy's reach once more. Of course, it's not that easy, life is messy no matter who you are, or which laws of physics you can temporarily suspend. But it's the way that Sarah Gailey deconstructs the dream that makes this such a great book - she's realistic but not uncaring with her characters. Illusions aren't ripped away, but instead gradually removed - it still hurts, but they're given time to not be altogether unprepared. Each and every character feels real - flaws ranging from the mild to the serious, but mixed with the positive in a way that rings with authenticity. All in all, a great idea, executed masterfully, and a very good book.
