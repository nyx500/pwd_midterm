This book is 1,800 pages long.I'm not fact-checking myself, but rest assured it feels in the foundational religious text/600-level STEM textbook range.And I read every one of those proverbial tissue-paper pages. (I did not actually read a hard copy of this. See below hinting.)And yet, I have exactly one note.That note is: there is nothing funnier to me than charlie literally being no thoughts head empty. i knew i respected that man for a reason #acabHelpful? No. But it made me laugh. So thank you, past Emma.To be honest, I really liked this book at first. It almost...concerned me. It would have been devastating to my brand and image to genuinely enjoy a Twilight book in 2020.But thank god Stephenie Meyer saved me from herself.Because this got old very, very quickly.Twilight power rankings -1) Alice2) Charlie, the only cop I respect3) EdwardAnd yet this book still wasn't good.Being in Edward's head gets old. I can't imagine how he did it for 11,000 years before creeping on a child.But let's get out of here before we have to start considering the morals of this series.Bottom line: Don't - Read this book. Do - Donate to the Quileutes.----------pre-reviewwell. i did it.but at what cost????review to come / 3 stars----------currently-reading updatesLET'S! GET! READY! TO! SUUUUUUUFFER!note: this series is bad and has done a lot of damage. i donated what this book would have cost me to the Quileute tribe's move to higher ground and paid $0 for this. let's leave it at that.----------tbr reviewwhat better way to spend a summer than by reading thousands of pages' worth of sexually frustrated vampires----i already swallowed my pride and added the old edition of this book...now i have to do it again?!13 year old me better appreciate this
