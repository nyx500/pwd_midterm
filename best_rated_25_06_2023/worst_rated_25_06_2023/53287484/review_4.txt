i would like to thank not only god but mormon jesus for bestowing this gift upon me in the year of our lord 2020let's all stand for 672 pages of murderous, horny edward---------------------------------------review:i had no idea going into this book what i wanted it to be. i read the original 12 leaked chapters back in the day and just like everyone else i craved an entire tome. but i am so glad that we didn't get the release 12 years ago. the wait was undoubtedly worth it.this book delivered every unanswered question, every charming moment with side characters, every aching piece of internal dialogue from edward. we get to see edward at his most depraved, his most happy, his most anxious. we get to experience him falling in love. and it all made so much sense. if you find yourself wondering upon reread of twilight why the two fall so quickly, i feel like this book answers that question. and for all detractors of edward, i think we get a really convincing look at his attitude toward his relationship with bella (i.e. consent & respect king).in short, it was everything that a fan could hope for. my adoration for this book is without end. and my love for this series, much like edward's love for bella, is eternal.---------------------------------------also! if you love the twilight series, i think it's important to know that the real Quileute Tribe hasn't received any compensation from either Stephenie Meyer or the series/movies/merch (despite their culture and legends being misappropriated in the books). currently the Tribe is trying to move some of their buildings (such as their Tribal school) to higher ground because they are in a tsunami zone. here's a link to understand more/to donate!https://mthg.org/
