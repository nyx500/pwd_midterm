5/02/2021 update: as much as i would love to read about stalker boyfriends (not really), i decided to put this in the not gonna happen pile. if i really want to put myself through mental torture (the good kind), i’ll reread an ember in the ashes ✨—/—/—/—/—*me telling myself why reading this book is a bad idea*me: Edward is a stalker, Bella is annoying and has no individuality, I’m not a twilight fangirl and this series pisses me off.also me: *adds book to shelf*
