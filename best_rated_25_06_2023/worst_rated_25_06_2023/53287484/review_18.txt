this was the most bizarre mix of returning to childhood while also having that childhood ruined. it really put a damper on twilight's barely tolerable creepiness to learn that even when edward isn't noticeably with bella, he's always lurking in a tree outside her house or something. a book i thought would take me a weekend to devour ended up taking 3 weeks, so let that struggle speak for itself.(random sidenote: one thing i didn't expect from this was how much more i came to love emmett)
