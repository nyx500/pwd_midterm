Omg! THIS book was EVERYTHING! Please for the love of everything, Stephenie, write the rest of the books in Edward’s perspective!!! 🖤 I only put in a few quotes, but I will return with more at a later date!! Holy shit snacks!! I love it so much! It’s so damn different and cool!! It did not happen often, but every now and then I would be struck by the obliviousness of the humans around us. We were all so accustomed to it, we always expected it, but occasionally it seemed more glaring than usual. None of them noticed us here, lounging at the battered cafeteria table, though an ambush of tigers sprawled in our places would be less lethal than we were. All they saw were five odd-looking people, close enough to human to pass. It was hard to imagine surviving with senses so incredibly dull.I love how Edward talks about reading his families minds and the different thoughts and struggles. I really wish Stephenie would do the whole series in his perspective!Bella Swan walked into the flow of heated air that blew toward me from the vent. Her scent hit me like a battering ram, like an exploding grenade. There was no image violent enough to encompass the force of what happened to me at that moment. Instantly, I was transformed. I was nothing close to the human I’d once been. No trace of the shreds of humanity I’d managed to cloak myself in over the years remained. I was a predator. She was my prey. There was nothing else in the whole world but that truth. I was a vampire, and she had the sweetest blood I’d smelled in more than eighty years.to be continued.....
