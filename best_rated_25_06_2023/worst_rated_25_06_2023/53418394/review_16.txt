"The First Daughter is for the throne.The Second Daughter is for the Wolf.And the Wolves are for the Wilderwood."Well, this is a tough one to review, because there isn't anything wrong with the story, it just felt very "been there, done that, got the t-shirt". Sometimes we come across books that are the perfect match for other readers, but we've encountered this story in various forms so many times ourself, that it's tough to write what feels like the hundredth review for a similar plot. Obviously it's a fairytale retelling, it has the hundreds of years older H in contrast to the young h, familiar world building and plot, and generic characters. I definitely think the author's writing style has potential, and this was definitely my favorite aspect of the story, I just wish the overall page count had been shaved down by about 50 pages. Highly recommend to fans of fantasy with some romance and an *almost* YA feel. *Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.
