I wanted to love this series so badly - but something about it just didn't work for me. I kept expecting that Beauty & The Beast style story, and while it was there layered under different elements, I was too distracted by other plot elements to really enjoy this retelling. THOUGHTS: - The writing is actually very good, but I think because it's more of a new adult novel and the main characters are both so young.. it felt a little too juvenile. The character building focused so much on angst and not enough on building and allowing the characters to grow until the end. - There's another book, and I probably won't read that now but I think I may give this one a try again in the future? Right now, it just didn't feel right. I created a 'needs a do over' shelf for books like this that I think I'll come back to one day!! My mood may not have made this one an easy read. -------- There's a lot of symbolism in the way religion, sacrifice, and martyrdom are presented in 'For the Wolf' and I don't know that I agree with some of the messaging present. **Totally random, but I love the paperback version of this book with its jagged edge-cut pages, and the cover is gorgeous!
