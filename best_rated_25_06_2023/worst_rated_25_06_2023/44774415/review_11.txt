❥ 4 / 5 stars[ e-ARC received from NetGalley ]Adorable Story ✔️Beautiful Artwork ✔️Family Dynamic ✔️Magic ✔️Super Cute Main Characters ✔️This will be one of the books that I will buy for sure when it comes out although I’ve already read it. It has everything that I want in one book and the representation of someone who has a hearing disability is really nice. 💛P.S. I’m so thankful to Netgalley and the publisher who gave an opportunity to me to read this book.
