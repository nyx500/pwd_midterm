My thoughts in a nutshell It could've been better. Let's start with what I adored this graphic novel.I enjoyed the drawing style. It is gorgeous. I really like that the main character is non-binary and another protagonist is half Chinese-half American queer witch. I think the diversity works very well in this novel.The family dynamic and friendship is powerful. It is a vital part of the comic.I don't like the in medias res beginning. This novel didn't have a reasonable starting point or accurate ending. I hate the insta love. We didn't know the character's past.I don't understand the title. Why is it 'Mooncake'? I don't remember any of that.Overall, it is just okay. It was sometimes monotonous. The story didn't hold my attention.I gave it 3 stars. It was a fast read. I wouldn't recommend buying it if you can borrow it from the library.The ARC of this book was provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
