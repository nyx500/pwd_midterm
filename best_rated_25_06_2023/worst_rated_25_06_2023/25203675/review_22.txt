DNF @ 43%I really tried liking this! It had all the things I loved: Indian culture, post-marriage love story, fantasy, but it was really boring. I literally felt nothing while reading this and I fell asleep majority of the time. The insta-love would not have been that bad if Amar, the love interest, didn't keep telling the MC things like "you are my hope and more" and other sweet things after only knowing her for like days...  Update : Apparently, there was a reason for this but stillThere were like only 3 people in the castle which was really boring because I love me some side characters. The book was like a poorly executed version of A Court of Thorns and Roses I did like the beginning when Maya was at her father's castle but it went downhill after thatWon't rate since I didn't even go half way (but i probably would not have liked it anyway)  Pre-reading This is a hit or miss with readers. Hopefully, its a hit for me! ðŸ˜«Buddy-read with valedictorian
