4.5 starsI read this in one day because it is addictive as all heck.  Omfg. It wasn’t a perfect five for me, but it has been a hot minute since a fantasy romance captured me so entirely. This was such a fun ride and while I was able to predict the twist early on, it didn’t hinder my enjoyment.If you were a fan of The Bridge Kingdom but wanted it much smuttier and more magical (aka: Vampires), you will ADORE this book because it gave me VERY similar vibes. I would rate this a 3.5/5 on a spice scale,  especially because I appreciated all the ~self love~ scenes. I also adored how s3x positive this book was and how heroine refused to be shamed for it. That is always a hallmark of a stellar book and I adore heroines like Isolde so much. She is a warrior first and a queen second, she isn’t afraid to take action and ask for approval later. The romance was good and I liked how the tried to avoid miscommunication as much as possible. Their chemistry was immediate and you could tell how much he loved her from the very start. It isn’t my fave romance of all time, hence the 4.5 star, but it has so much potential. I also loved that Adrian always cleaned her blade for her whenever she killer someone—so sweet of him. Like I said, it is super fast-paced and a total page turner. However, that does mean that sometimes thing aren’t fully explained. This didn’t totally bother me because things were continually revealed as the book went on, and I know any plot holes or threads left over will be dealt with in further books. My favourite character, other than Isolde, was Sorin.  My baby brought so much comedy and had me laughing. He was so open and sweet to Issa, too. I swear, if anything happens to him, I will cry. This is my first book from St. Clair and I look forward to checking out her backlist. That being said, I NEED BOOK 2 NOW BECAUSE OMMMG THAT ENDING WAS INTENSE. Okay. Thank you.
