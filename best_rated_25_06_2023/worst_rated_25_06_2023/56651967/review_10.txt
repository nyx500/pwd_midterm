I had a lot to say about Isolde and this “romance” between her and Adrian… “Do not tremble under the gaze of the Blood King. Surrender today, live to conquer tomorrow.” Hoping to end the war and bloodshed that ravages Revekka, princess Isolde accepts to marry the Blood King Adrian Alexander Vasilia, even though he is a vampire and her kingdom’s sworn enemy. Isolde plans on getting close enough to him to find a way to finally end his life, but as she travels with him and spends time in the red palace, she comes to realize (of course), that there is more to their land’s history than what she was told, and that Adrian is not simply a bloodthirsty monster. Things get even more complicated and tough for Isolde when she realizes that there is an enormous sexual tension between Adrian and her and that they cannot seem to keep their hands off each other, even though she hates herself for wanting him. There is politics in this book, but it is your usual and predictable YA/NA fantasy politics. Some vampires do not like the fact that Adrian brought back a human queen and they are trying to get rid of her, but they are not very subtle, and their identities were never a secret. Besides the threats on Isolde’s life, it was your usual court politics, but not very detailed or developed. There were also a few twists and even a betrayal, but sadly, I saw most of them coming because of the hints that were dropped here and there. The foreshadowing was way too evident for me not to guess what was coming.Isolde is not a main character that I liked. I really liked her in the first few chapters; she was strong, and independent, and saying how she wanted to rule without having to marry because she was raised to be a good ruler… Then I stopped liking her when she started traveling with Adrian and his vampires because she couldn’t stop acting like a jealous teen and she was so contradictory! All of her driven side disappears and instead, we got a whining teenager facing mean girls and bullies. She describes herself as a “strong woman”, but she is petty and SO jealous, and believes she should rule because it is her right and she was raised to do so, and because of that I didn’t see her as a kind and altruistic ruler, but rather a jealous teenager seeing every other women as threats or people there to help and serve her. I was really not impressed with her.-Many women went to Isolde to brag about the fact that they had sex with Adrian before and they knew how to please him, and it made Isolde jealous so she lashed back at them and got revenge. -Adrian’s vassal (the one he was taking blood from since Isolde refused to let him drink from her) was trying to make Isolde jealous by talking about her “special” relationship with Adrian and of course, it worked and Isolde spent the rest of the book being jealous of the vassal, while the vassal spent the rest of the book lying and trying to make herself appear more important than she was (typical teenage drama). -Adrian and his vampires did not tell everything to Isolde because she made it no secret that she still considered them to be her enemies and didn’t trust them, so of course, they wouldn’t trust her with their secrets and battle plans, yet Isolde was hurt every single time she learned that they didn’t share something with her.At least, most of the time Isolde realized that her behavior and jealous/hurt reactions were ridiculous, but the fact remains that I had to read wayyyyyyy too much about her jealousy and her whining about her hurt feelings for me to like her. “I am many things,” he said. “Man, monster, lover.” Adrian is not a bad character, and he didn't annoy me as Isolde did, but I am pretty indifferent to him. He had potential, being a dark and ruthless "villain" with a fiercely protective side and a lot of sex appeal, but his character was not developed enough to be really interesting. We know a lot about his sexual prowesses, but I wanted more depth and layers, not just smut and some sexy or swoon-worthy moments every once in a while. “You assume I want a wife,” he said. “But I came for a queen.” It was my turn to stare. “So our marriage will be one of pageantry?” “Oh, I think we are both too passionate for that.” The author spent too much time focusing on the relationship drama, and not enough time on the plot and developing the characters. Also, the fact that many important and significant conversations between Isolde and Adrian happened while they were having sex just feels weird. They obviously have this very physical and intense connection that makes it impossible for them not to rip their clothes off when they are together for more than a few minutes, yet they can take the time to chat while having sex? And once the sex part is over, don’t ask them to sit and talk seriously because of course, suddenly all feelings-related discussion is just impossible to have. It only added to the immaturity I felt from Isolde, but from Adrian, it was a little harder to explain considering how old he is.This romance is a hate-to-love on Isolde’s part, but I feel that the “love” part did not develop entirely because of Adrian’s actions or words, or because Isolde realized that he wasn’t so bad. It mostly develops because they kept on having great sex together, and Isolde couldn’t endure being apart from Adrian because of the sex, not because she cared that much about him. That is, until the last 20% of the book where she suddenly realized that he was meant for her and she for him and that nothing would ever tear them apart. It just felt sudden, and a little too intense considering the lack of conversations and meaningful relationship-building between them during the first 80% of the book.“You dishonor her,” he said. Adrian offered a shrewd smile. “In what way? By fucking her against a wall? It feels like worship to me.” This book is mostly smut, with a side of plot, and a dash of action. It is not a bad book, but I was expecting more. I was expecting a smutty book sure, but with a decent plot and likable characters at least. Instead, I got a smut-fest with vampires. Isolde is the horniest, most hormonal young adult I’ve read about: most of the time, she’s either masturbating, having wet dreams, thinking explicitly about having sex or having sex. The horniness just never stops and quantity does not mean quality when it comes to smut in books. There is A LOT of smut in this one, and by the 50% mark, it even started to feel a little repetitive.Despite the fact that I only gave this book 3 stars and my many complaints in my review, this is still an entertaining quick read. It’s just that I was hoping for something a little more developed and layered instead of this smut-fest with a side of predictable plot. Still, if you are looking for an easy-to-read hot and smutty book to get your mind off things, this is definitely a good choice for you.Fanart by TheCleverCrowFollow me on Instagram 🙂
