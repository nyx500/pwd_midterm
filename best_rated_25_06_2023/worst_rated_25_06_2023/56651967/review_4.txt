“All the stars in the sky are not as bright as my love for you.” 🔹Overall feelings: 📚 I was so disappointed by this book. I’ve been seeing it on Bookstagram non-stop lately and the premise sounded so interesting to me that I decided to pick it up. I mean, come on; an enemies to lovers marriage of convenience where the girl is sent to kill him?!?! That sounds right up my alley. And on top of it all, it’s paranormal AND has vampires in it… *mindblown*. This is the sort of book that I normally genuinely love to read. That said, after actually reading it… I have to say that I was extremely let down.🔹The plot: 📚 The second I read the synopsis I actually immediately thought of “The Bridge Kingdom” by Danielle Jensen. The latter is one of my absolute favorite romantasy books because it was brilliantly able to (in my opinion) balance the romance with a very engaging and intriguing plot. Since both books deal with similar tropes and topics, I thought this one would also be a win for me. Safe to say, that was not the case.📚 I was promised a paranormal romance filled with political intrigue. What I got however, is smut…with absolutely nothing else. I’m not even joking. I understand that this book is now well beloved by many but you guys cannot tell me that this had a decent plot. In my opinion (pls don’t attack me lol), the only plot in this entire novel revolved around how horny the two main characters could get. 📚 Nothing happens throughout the entire book. We just follow Isolde as she pretends to hate her husband until she suddenly and out of nowhere realizes that she actually loves him. Nope, still not joking. As for the whole “witches” side plot and the big reveal at the end, the only thing that would surprise me about this “twist” is if anyone actually was surprised by it. It was not so subtly “hinted at” from the very beginning. Also, I’m just gonna say it: it was such a stupid twist. I usually love this sort of plot but it was not well done in here… at all. We don’t even understand how she got back (at least I didn’t—I might be the only one though, so I won’t dwell on this.) Also, I’m very aware that this is the first installment which means that many of my questions should be answered in the sequel— I won’t know for sure though since I’m not planning on reading the sequel but, you know, oh well.🔹The characters: Isolde:📚 My God I could not stand her. Here’s the thing. I absolutely love strong heroines. Honestly, who doesn’t?! Give me a strong, independent heroine all day everyday. I eat that stuff up. However, what I have come to find is that there’s a very thin line between being a powerful and fierce heroine and being aggressive and mean for no reason whatsoever. Authors often struggle with this line and this simple mistake can make me go from loving a character to absolutely hating her. This was the case with Isolde. We’re supposed to see her as this amazing, independent woman who doesn’t take shit from anyone but all I saw was a mean character who genuinely attacked everyone she meets for no apparent reason. And I hated that. She always felt the need to assert her dominance even when the situation did not call for it. 📚 Another thing that I want to mention here is the non-stop girl on girl hate. This is one of the most frustrating “tropes” (and I say trope because that’s literally what it is at this point) to read about. Can authors please stop doing this? It’s not realistic and not enjoyable to read about. Women are not like that in real life. I would understand if Isolde only met like, one woman who was mean to her and who had to be “put in her place” but in this book, the author made it seem like pretty much all women were against the heroine (not even because the latter is human—a lot of the hate also came from human women— but simply because they felt like it). That said, this is another thing that I hated about this book.📚 Also, this novel gave me flashbacks to the “Blood and Ash” series with how they glorified (?) the whole “pulling a knife on someone” trope. Don’t get me wrong, although I love that trope, I hate when it’s mentioned repeatedly or when it becomes something “cute” that the heroine did. It’s cute the first time it’s mentioned but after that, let’s just get over it please.Adrian:📚 Very one dimensional and boring. Again, I felt like the author was inspired by FBAA and based her characters off Casteel and Poppy. And although I now hate that series, I have to say that Jennifer Armentrout did a better job with the characters. Adrian’s whole personality trait in here is that he’s supposedly violent and that he loves his wife. I finished this whole book and I still know absolutely nothing about him as an individual character...🔹The romance and other stuff:📚 Isolde goes from hating her husband to loving him in the span of a few pages.📚 Isolde goes from completely rejecting vampires to accepting them and their way of life in the span of a few pages.📚 Isolde goes from not remembering anything to remembering everything and accepting the whole “plot twist” in the span of a few pages (by the way, the way she remembers and realizes who she is was SO anticlimactic).📚 There is absolutely no chemistry between the characters. All they do is have sex. There is not one meaningful conversation between them.🔹Final thoughts: 📚 This book had no plot whatsoever. The characters were not likeable or interesting in my opinion and I have to say, the writing style did not work for me for most of the book. In other words, the premise was extremely interesting but the execution was lacking and left much to be desired. That said, if the premise sounds interesting to you then I still won’t tell you not to read it. My opinion is unpopular (as always) so chances are, you’ll end up enjoying this more than I did (which I hope you do)!📚 By the way, please excuse this very messy review. I’ve been focusing on my bookstagram lately so I feel like I haven’t written a proper review in a while — which means that I’m very aware that this is kind of all over the place lol.“Never forget, my queen, that goddesses are just humans with great power.” Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rose_books2/———————————Why does this sound so good?
