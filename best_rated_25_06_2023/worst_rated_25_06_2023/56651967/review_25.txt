✨✨✨✨ starsSurprisingly I liked this omgI thought this would be like FBAA (barf) but actually, this was better. It had good plot and good smutI didn't hate the heroine which was a surprise bcz i usually hate NA heroines bcz they're all like "oh ik everything ill kill everyone" but actually never does it. And Adrian wasn't an asshole. He didn't speak stupid things and was actually morally grey<3 (swoon)I LOVED SORIN and DAROC. We stand the gayss <3.One thing i hated abt this was the woman vs woman thing where Isolde literally hates anyone who even talks to adrian I'm like girl chill pls :))))This books is nothing new (taylor reference yes) but actually a combination of good parts of FBAA, Shadows between us and TVD. I loved the whole witchy vibe in the second halfThis book is not perfect what you would call fine literature. Its just some trashy entertainment for people like me and that's why i enjoyed it. there were some plot holes here and there and some twists were kinda obvious but i enjoyed it nonethelessI cant wait for the next one to come out eeek
