you know that saying about pizza that says even when its bad, its still good?yeahhh, that also applies to this book. lol.nothing about this story is unique. ive read it all before. the plot in ‘the shadows between us,’ the twists in ‘city of thorns,’ and the overall vibe and world in ‘from blood and ash.’ this book is literally a combination all of these three with nothing that is new. but heres the thing. even if the material is recycled and the writing and characterisation not the best, i still ate. this. up. i loved those other books, so theres no reason why i wouldnt enjoy this one. my tastes are pretty simple when it comes to needing some easy entertainment and this hit the spot. ↠ 4 stars
