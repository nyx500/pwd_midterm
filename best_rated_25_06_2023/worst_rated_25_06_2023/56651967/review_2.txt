This was one of my most anticipated books this year, and my God, did it exceed my (high) expectations! Iâ€™m all for a good enemies-to-lovers story. Throw in an arranged marriage and you got me, hook, line and sinker. Isolde is the ultimate female power fantasyâ€”strong, just, wise, and willing to get her hands dirty when need be. Adrian, meanwhile, is the perfect anti-heroâ€”heâ€™s not simply evil, but heâ€™s no saint either. It makes him unpredictable and really just enticing. Their chemistry was just ðŸ”¥! Thereâ€™s a twist in the novel that I just went WILD over, and man did it wrench my heartstrings in the best way. Also, side note, but the writing itself? *chefâ€™s kiss* So good. Scarlett St. Clair writes enviable fantasy! The only hard part now is the book hangover I have to deal withâ€”and settling in for the wait to the sequel! ***GIVE IT TO ME.OH MY GOD. THIS LOOKS SO FRIGGIN' GOOD. DID IT JUST OFFICIALLY BECOME ONE OF MY MOST ANTICIPATED READS?HELL MOTHER-F*CKING YES.P.S. NO, I WILL NOT TURN CAPS LOCK OFF BECAUSE I. AM. NOT. CHILL. RIGHT. NOW.
