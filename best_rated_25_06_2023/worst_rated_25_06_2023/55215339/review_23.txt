ah, screw it. i'll do my homework in the morning. or in the middle of the night.(3.5/5)This book was absolutely trashy in the best way possible. There was literally no plot to speak of whatsoever, but I somehow found myself absolutely immersed and unable to tear myself away. (I sat and read for like 3 hours straight!!) There's nothing particularly special or nice about the writing, or the characters for that matter, but the way that St. Clair was able to write the slow burn was... *chef's kiss*I found Persephone pretty annoying throughout the whole book, but it was really funny to read things from her view in a third-person perspective, considering how awkward she was when it came to... everything, pretty much. That being said, the ending really fell flat for me - it seemed unnecessarily rushed and a touch too... I don't know. Perfect? Far more easily resolved than I had expected.Overall, there was something that really charmed me about this book and I simply wasn't able to put it down. The romance was cute in a way that reminded me of Elide and Lorcan from Throne of Glass.Side note: I have no intention to read the second book because a) I don't need a second book, b) the synopsis is making me hate it, and c) I usually end up hating the second book in these kinds of series (this is a fact, proven by a whole shelf of these sorts of books).
