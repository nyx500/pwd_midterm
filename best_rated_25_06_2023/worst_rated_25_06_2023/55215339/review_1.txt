Readers are bound to get hyped because of the Hades & Persephone reference, and I feel like this updated cover might lead to false expectations cause it’s too pretty and not enough risqué. Therefore, you should be informed that this book is a smutty urban fantasy loose retelling of the King and Queen of Hell. In other words, it’s the perfect escape for a mindless guilty pleasure read should you ever need one. I mean, who doesn’t?Hades was delicious. It’s Persephone I had a problem with, or rather this version of Persephone. She was, um, annoying. For one, she was a reporter—a terrible one at that; two, she constantly doubted and misjudged poor Hades to be the worst of the worst despite being proven otherwise; three, I didn’t like the mother daughter relationship she had with Demeter. Hecate was my favorite character, and I loved the Underworld.It’s easy to lose yourself within these pages because/in spite of the fairly simplistic writing and minimal world building. It’s entertaining, but I’m not fully invested in it yet. I’m not going to hold my breath, but hopefully these characters won’t embarrass the original gods and goddesses they’re based off of in the sequel. In the meantime, if you’re a romance fanatic who loves mythology and enjoys books written by authors, such as Jennifer L. Armentrout and Laura Thalassa, A Touch of Darkness will serve you well.(Read as an Audiobook)
