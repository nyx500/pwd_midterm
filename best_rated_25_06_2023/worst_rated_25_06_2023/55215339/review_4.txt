This was a huge miss for me. From the start, the writing felt very unpolished and I wasn't a fan of the writing style. The way things were explained felt very choppy and I could not ignore how badly things were explained or characters were developed. As far as the characters go, Persephone was so infuriating. She would make very stupid decisions just for the plot's sake and I was annoyed with her pretty much the whole book. I really did like Hades, but he fell flat for me in his development. We saw him through Persephone's eyes and never got to actually make our own decisions about him based on the way he acted. I'm curious how the book from his perspective would be because I was much more interested in him that I was in Persephone in the story. Overall, this was just a huge miss for me. There was also a trope used for the third act break up that annoys me to no end, so that was pretty much the last straw.
