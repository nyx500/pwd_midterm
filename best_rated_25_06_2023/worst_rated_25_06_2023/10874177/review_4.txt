A cute, young adult book with a steampunk theme that takes place at a "finishing" school which isn't about etiquette at all.I made the mistake of reading this without realizing that it was based in a world from another series of books. I'm guessing that I would have enjoyed it more if I had read the other set first.Etiquette and Espionage had plenty of fun moments in it. One of my favorites is when Sophronia inexplicably claims that werewolves enjoy the theater. From one of the other books? I'm assuming so. But it sounds legit. I also loved when one of the students bemoans the fact that she doesn't believe she'll ever be able to kill anyone and the teacher comforts her with the fact that she may never have to. What a relief.But funny moments do not a story make. The plot centers around Sophronia's introduction to a world filled with spies that she didn't know existed, the concealment of a highly desirable piece of equipment that has something to do with wireless technology, and, of course, fashion.It is funny, frivolous and frothy. I found that I wanted more substance. Recommended for a light summer read around the pool and, perhaps, you may want to read The Parasol Protectorate series first, starting with Soulless.
