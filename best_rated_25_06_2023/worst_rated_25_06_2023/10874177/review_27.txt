I picked this book up at my local Dollar Tree store. I had heard of this series before so when I saw it I just had to get it. I have never read the Parasol Protectorate series so I was a bit unfamiliar with the world. Regardless, this book was still lot of fun. My only issue was that the ending felt rushed.
