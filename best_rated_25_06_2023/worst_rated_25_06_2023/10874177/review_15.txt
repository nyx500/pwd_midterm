Lovely YA adventure in Carriger's SOULLESS world. It was fun to see some characters from her adult books as kids, and the series is off to a rollicking start. The underlying mystery of this book was a bit light, mostly so that she could introduce the finishing school and the cast of characters, and that was fine by me, because they were delightful. I'd really like to see her go a bit longer with the next one, this felt too short! Also, I really, REALLY need a mechanical wiener dog named Bumbersnoot because . . . IT'S A MECHANICAL WIENER DOG NAMED BUMBERSNOOT!
