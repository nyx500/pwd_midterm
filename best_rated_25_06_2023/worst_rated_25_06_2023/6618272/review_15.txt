Kiera Cass has that style to write books which are kind of cute and really easy to get into them but at some points everything turns out so predictive and nothing surprised me and specially in this book. In The Selection books I kind of read all of them really fast and I enjoyed them a lot, but The Siren I had to force myself a little bit to keep reading it and the plot was kind of cheesy. If there's something that I really liked was the relationship between the sisters but...sadly that's all. I enjoyed it mostly because it has the same style as The Selection and it makes you want to read more but the insta love and all the idea of sirens and everything going on there...just no.
