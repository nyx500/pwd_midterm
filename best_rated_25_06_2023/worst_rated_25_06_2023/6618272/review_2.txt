The Siren was a... SNOOZEFEST.I'm so disappointed in this book. I was such a huge fan of The Selection series so I expected to really like The Siren but honestly, everything was just super dull.The characters were boring. The only thing I enjoyed about the siren sisters was their dedication and loyalty to one another. The concept behind the Sirens and the Ocean was interesting but I didn't really love it. And on top of that, the romance was 100 percent insta-love. Their feelings developed too fast after just one date that lasted for about an hour and because of that, it became way too unrealistic for me and I couldn't even feel any of the emotions that I was supposed to feel in the end.Prior to reading the book, I thought the negative reviews were just a little harsh and I expected that the book would actually improve by a long shot once Kiera Cass rewrote and republished it again, but if I thought this "new and improved" version was ehhh, I could only imagine how the first edition must've been.The only thing that really saved this book for me was the last 50 pages or so but even then, 50 pages doesn't nearly make up for the other disappointing 250.Long story short, reading The Siren felt like a Disney Little Mermaid knockoff. The only difference was that Disney actually pulled off the insta-love romance.Although this book fell short for me, I'm still a huge fan of Kiera Cass. I love her writing and the concepts that she comes up with. Hopefully she comes out with a new book outside of The Selection series to make up for this one because you can always count on me to pick up a book by Kiera Cass.
