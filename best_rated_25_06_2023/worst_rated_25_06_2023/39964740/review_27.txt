I meant to write an actual review a couple days ago already, but I'm still lacking the words for the time being.All I know is that this is one of these rare, magical books that pulled me in to take a piece of my heart and never give it back again.It's almost impossible for most readers, me included, to name just one book when asked about a favorite title. But this one has definitely made it onto the short list I usually give people.
