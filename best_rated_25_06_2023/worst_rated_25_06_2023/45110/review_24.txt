Once again Robin Hobb impresses with her ability to create an amazingly real and detailed world and wonderfully complex and entertaining characters to inhabit it. You know you're dealing with a truly talented author when the story is full of hardships, pain and disillusionment and it is still a joy to read. This is the first of a very promising trilogy and I look forward eagerly to the continuing story of Nevarre, the hero who thinks he knows exactly what his future holds for him until one day an ancient magic grips him, changing everything, but revealing itself oh-so-slowly. As always, Hobb's characters face many challenges to their beliefs along with difficult moral choices. There are environmental themes also, which I expect to come into more prominence as the series continues.---------------After a second reading of this in March 2010 to prepare for finally finishing the trilogy, I've decided to up my rating to 5 stars. Robin Hobb truly is a master storyteller! And, wow, reading some of the reviews posted here has just reminded me of how few people are intellectual readers anymore. Give most readers a carefully constructed tale of (mostly) mental hardships, internal struggles and personal conflicts and they're bored, the plot is too 'slow' or 'plodding', the book needs editing for length. I for one enjoyed the cerebral quality found here and greatly look forward to the rest of Nevarre's journey.
