I spent far too long steering clear of this book because reviewers were almost unanimous that this ‘wasn’t as good as the Farseer books’. Let me tell you, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Robin Hobb is one of my favourite fantasy authors and this a well written and compelling read. I am intrigued by the story line and have no idea where the trilogy could take us. #bringiton
