HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY TO THIS LITTLE COCKTAIL OF MAGIC AND WONDER!i know for a fact that this book wont be everyones cup of tea (morgensterns writing style is an acquired taste), but it sure is mine. this quenches my thirst for a story that was meant to be told, a love letter to the art of storytelling, as well as the stories we find ourselves in. it is an ode to those who write their own paths in life. and there is an aromatic intimacy to this that can only be created when such words are so tenderly placed on a page. with delicious notes of myth and legend, imagination and wonder, this supplies the perfect blend of magic, bravery, adventure, wisdom, and love. it is a full-bodied flavour that impacts the palate, leaving it satiated, yet somehow desiring more. this is a story to be savoured from one page to the next, entincing the reader to acknowledge all the smooth layers and undertones, because each word has such a meaningful presence, it would be a shame to miss something. and as i drink up every last letter, i become so delightfully intoxicated on the notion that we are all made of stories and stardust. its a buzzed feeling that reminds me exactly why i fell in love with reading in the first place and how we all become a part of the stories we love. üêù üóù üó°‚Ü† every star to return to the starless sea
