3 starsTime for those who have read my reviews before to see a bit of deja vu. I have from time to time mentioned books that are artsy for the sake of moving along the story in a unique fashion and they are wonderful. But, on the other side, there are books that are artsy for the sake of being artsy. Books where the weird and fantastic plot points feel forced in order to make the book seem edgy and trendy. This is, of course, in the eye of the beholder, so you may not feel the same about this as I do from book to book. For me, The Starless Sea rode a fine line between the two the whole way.At first, I really got into the fantasy world of this book. It was doing a wonderful job of building a magical connection between the real world and a world from books. It reminded me a bit of The Shadow of the Wind. In fact, I am pretty sure they referenced that book early on. (I say pretty sure because I am reading multiple books, so it could have been in one of those!). I thought the writing style was wonderful and remained so throughout.However, as the story progressed, I started to lose the continuity of the storyline because it felt like it was trying to hard to be "fantastic". There were about 5 separate storylines that jumped around and the events in each just got stranger and stranger. Every so often there were a few moments that reoriented me to the actual progress, but the last half was mainly disorientation and some lack of interest. If it was not audio, I am not sure I would have finished.Some may love this book a great deal and enjoy getting lost in the artsy twists and turns of the multiple storylines. But, if you have ever agreed with me before on books being artsy for the sake of being artsy, you may have the same experience I did.
