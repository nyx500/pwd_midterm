I wanted to like The Steel Remains so much more than I actually did. I was so looking forward to reading it. I've read two of Richard K. Morgan's science fiction novels, Thirteen and Altered Carbon and thought they were unique and amazing. Morgan takes sex and violence to a level I would never be able to tolerate in a movie and manages to glamorize neither. He reveals the damage violence does to those who commit it, even the bad guys. He really understands socio-politics and is great at extrapolating the future based on today. I really wanted to see how he would bring that ability to the fantasy genre.It seems to me that Morgan is not at all comfortable with writing fantasy. The Steel Remains drags so much through the first 2/3 and never really achieves any kind of depth or meaning. The main character, Ringil, is a gay war hero. It really felt like Morgan was not comfortable with Ringil's sexuality and that he made him gay just for shock value. After all, he is messing with fantasy tropes here and you can't mess with the romantic male fantasy hero more than making him gay. He also includes several gay sex scenes involving Ringil that were very graphic and seemed very, very awkward. As a character, Ringil is at his best when he is flashing back to the memories of his first love who was tortuously executed for perversion. His horror and regret did ring true.The Steel Remains is supposed to be the first installment of a trilogy. Fortunately, it is a complete story and does have a real ending. There's room for more, but it's not necessary. I, for one, will not be reading the next episode.
