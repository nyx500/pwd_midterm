"The Shadow of the Torturer" is a sci-fi story that has the feel of a fantasy world. Gene Wolf has a wonderful writing style but the story is on the strange side.Severian is an apprentice in the Torturer's Guild. Torturers carry out judicial torture and killing of the court's victims. Need I say Torturers are not well liked in the wider world? All is well for Severian until he foolishly allows himself to fall in love with a prisoner named Thecla. Violating his order's remit and oath, Severian smuggles a knife into her chambers and allows her a merciful end. This results in his banishment.What follows from here is where the story gets very strange and you realize that this is a sci-fi story. As Severian travels towards his city of exile, he meets various characters and seems to fall in love quite quickly. This draws him into some odd situations.The world is only hinted at. Wolfe expects you to learn more as you read. I am certainly intrigued by the hints of the world. I really enjoyed the first parts of the story. The middle to rather abrupt ending parts detailing Severian's adventures with Dorcas, Agia and Dr. Talos were where the tale gets very strange. It is certainly a book that I will need to read the following parts of.A enjoyed Wolfe's writing style. I also liked the setting, but the story arc, so far, is somewhat confusing. A good sci-fi story set in a unique world.
