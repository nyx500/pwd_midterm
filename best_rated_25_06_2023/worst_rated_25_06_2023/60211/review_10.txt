Re-read, and now I'm more attentive to the weird mysteries going on here. Events are retold in weird little puzzles that raise and re-raise the question of what might have really happened. It's definitely an interesting way to write, though it feels a bit dated without a more direct emotional investment in the characters.Cool old school fantasy. Great start, with a chill introduction to this nightmare world of professional torturers. The middle is meandering, in an old school way, with a focus on building all the details of Urth instead of story or character. But hey it sure is a fully realized world, in an extreme amount of detail. Things come back together a bit by the end, but I imagine since this is the start of 4 novels, things actually come together better later on. This one seems like the full vision of this world became clear in the writing.I like reading influential classics because I can see how they echo through fantasy literature. That said, if you're looking for a casual contemporary read, this sure isn't the right pick. The language is tricky and ornate, and the book demands a slow read. But if you have the patience, it has a lot to give.
