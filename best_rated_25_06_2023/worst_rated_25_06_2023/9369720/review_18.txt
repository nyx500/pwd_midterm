After the not so impressive Torment I wasn't sure if I had wanted to continue with the series but me wants answers so here I am.This was actually not a bad book. I know a lot of people haven't liked this but I didn't mind it as much as Torment. Lauren Kate's writing wasn't the best and it had a lot of errors but I actually enjoyed the plot involving past lives and actually travelling there. Luce was still pretty stupid even her past selves were pretty stupid but I enjoyed her journey with Bill. I already suspected Bill's agenda and I was right. I loved Cameron in this the most even though he was barely there. I wish he were there more. I also liked Daniel's POV and started to like him again after not liking him in Torment. There are still so many questions that I need answers to like the most important one - Trevor? Why was he burnt alive? It's still not clear and the author doesn't even touch this topic and I am afraid that she isn't going to. Overall it wasn't bad. 3 stars
