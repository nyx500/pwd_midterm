**4.5-stars rounded up** In the Author's Note, Marie Lu tells of her real-life inspiration for The Kingdom of Back. A book over a decade in the making, you can tell Lu poured her heart and soul into this project.Known for her complex and forward-thinking YA SF, Lu takes a sharp turn with The Kingdom of Back, a subtly Dark Fantasy with lyrical prose.Even though this is not her typical story, I think it shines an extremely bright light on Lu's level of skill as a writer.I am the first to admit that I am a big sucker for any story involving music, or musicians, particularly classical musicians.Growing up, I played classical violin, piano and dappled with the clarinet. I was in multiple orchestras, yes, first chair violin, and I think that world always remains a part of your soul.Lu mentions that she too was a musician in her early life and after reading a biography of Mozart developed the idea for this story.Unlike my normal reviews, I am not really going to give details as to what this story is about. I feel strongly that it is best to go into this one not knowing what to expect.Mainly following Mozart's unknown sister, Nannerl, this story quickly transforms from a historic fiction account of the Mozart family's life, to a dark fantasy with a portal to another world and a Faustian bargain of sorts.In addition to the fantastical elements of the story, there is also a great examination of the role of women in this time period and the affect that society's expectations had on their productivity and spirit.If you do pick up this book, I implore you to please, please, please read the Author's Note at the end. Reading Lu's words and thoughts on this story and why she wrote it, bumped this up from a 4, to a 5-star read for me.I was so impressed with this story. It was a dark, delicious, delightful read and further solidifies my belief that Marie Lu is an absolute treasure!
