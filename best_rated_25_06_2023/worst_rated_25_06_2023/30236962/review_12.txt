If this book was written as strictly nonfiction, I would have given it 5 stars because the research into the spellbinding topic of Vlad the Impaler, aka Dracula, was extremely extensive! However, it is fictional, and although the overall story was deliciously creepy, with a captivating ending, and several characters keeping me on my toes, omitting some of the excessive investigations and details would have cut down several pages/chapters in this novel and helped me be less confused as to where the plot was taking place (at times) as well as trying to remember and keep some of the characters straight, without losing the general gist of the story. But, overall, a "good read" and "audio-listen" for fans of Dracula!
