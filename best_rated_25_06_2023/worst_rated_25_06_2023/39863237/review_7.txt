3.5 stars I listened to this on audio and enjoyed the narration as there are 3 different narrators which helped make the jumps in time easier to follow as well as the footnotes. While this is an interesting world full of political machinations, it does become overly convoluted as the story goes on. Due to the nature of the magic system and various methods of “immortality”, the family trees in this are so complicated with so many twists revealed that by the end I had trouble remembering who was related to who and how. This made it harder to follow, especially character motivations and alliances. I’ll likely continue this series on audio since the narration was so good, but I don’t feel connected enough to the story to want to continue it ASAP.
