RereadI don’t like the sprayed edges on this one. It looks like they might have been trying to do a grey color from the grey book (which I like better and am going to get) or maybe a light blue. Holy shit balls! This book was so confusing and so good, I don’t even know what all I just read!! My mind!!! *photo: David Ho & George Redhawk Im looking forward to the next book and a reread of this crazy book! Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
