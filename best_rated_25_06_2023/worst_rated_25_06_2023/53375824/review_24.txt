Well. I have thoughts. This wasn't the worst but it definitely wasn't my favourite which is a tad disappointing. Had some good things going for it: the challenging of misogynistic myths, Castor's unfailing love, loyalty, and goodness, the budding romance between Miles and Van, the antihero tendencies of a certain god. But holy was there also erratic pacing, convoluted backstories and overall premise, and SO MANY flashbacks and dream sequences that drove me nutty. Anyways, no shade to this book, it was still good, just didn't live up to what i was hoping it would be!
