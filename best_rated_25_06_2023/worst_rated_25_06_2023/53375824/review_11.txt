I received this complimentary ARC from the publisher, in exchange for an honest review.Oh HELLO, Medusa!!! :oI was lucky enough to receive a full ARC, after the chapter sampler was made available. "It's not always the truth that survives, but the stories we wish to believe. The legends lie."And everyone...this book was such a fun read!!! This was a Greek mythological Hunger Games, where the descendants of famous Greek heroes ran around New York, trying to kill the Ancient Greek gods of old in order to steal their power for themselves. There were also so many strong feminist themes about the women who were often forgotten and excluded from Ancient Greek lore, which was something I really enjoyed, especially since I often complain about that exact thing. We always get to hear about Achilles, Perseus, Heracles, Theseus, etc but the women around them are often relegated to mere damsels in distress or play the part of the villain.Plus, there was the CUTEST childhood friends to lovers romance that I’ve read in a while between a badarse girl who could do some major damage and the SOFTEST boy who just wanted to help people. They were just SO ADORABLE! <3"You may deny the fates, but they will not deny you."I’ve never read a book by Alexandra Bracken until now, but I’m glad that I finally did. I highly recommend giving this a go when it releases in January!!! :)
