2.75/5 ‚≠êWatch out, there comes an unpopular (personal) opinion!*sigh*When I first read what Lore was all about, I was sold. A mix of Medusa (who is one of my faves, I must say) and The Hunger Games set in the present world?? Descendants of the OG heroes trying to kill the old gods to steal their powers of godhood?? That's nuts...and I loved it!But honestly, as I started the first chapter, then slowly made my way through the story, I realised that I am: 1) confused and 2) bored.Don't get me wrong, the idea of the plot was really, really good and I was desperate to like it, but it just didn't do the trick for me. Greek mythology generally confuses me so that's not this book's problem, it's mine. But even so, contributing to my confusion was the writing style of the author.Honestly, sometimes it felt like she wanted to give us little sneak peeks of what's going to happen with the action, but wait! Not too much! So she simply let us see glimpses of past actions while they were in the middle of happening. I also had a problem with the characters. As I generally had no problem per se with either of them, I simply could care less about them because they felt (to me) a little bit flat. It was nothing there to get me emotionally invested in them. Which, I think, it's sad.Overall, my experience with this book was the same as the action of sitting in a boat in the middle of a lake with no paddles and no wind to carry me anywhere.Nice and all, but after a while, you need to get somewhere.
