TW: rape; pedophilia; gore; cancerI wanted to enjoy this. I really did. But once I got to the end, I realized that I hated most of this reading experience. This had so much potential and ended up being so incredibly flat. The world is supposed to be modern day, but you wouldn’t know it by how characters act and how incredibly misogynistic the hunter society is. Sure, they are more of an insular culture but you can’t honestly have me believe that they are living in NYC and totally cut off from modern society and norms. Then I just didn’t buy most of the character dynamics and relationships. These people are supposed to be close and I just don’t see it outside of maybe Lore and Castor and Lore and Miles. But other friendships Lore supposedly have fall so flat and unbelievable. Without substance. And any conflict between “good” characters just get resolved. One of them tries to literally kill another one and it’s forgotten a few chapters later. You know what else is flat? The villains. These are some of the worst, one dimensional villains I have ever read. It’s like the author thought: “you know how we make sure everyone knows villain bad? Make him a pedophile rapist.” It’s such lazy writing. And he’s not even the only rapist! Not only that, but the lack of adults in the world is apparent and yet the author doesn’t even try to explain that away. The only adults present are other gods who are all bad, and we just have these teens running around with not even a mention of adults who would be involved somewhere in the lower structure of hunter society. So we have all these bad, one dimensional villains and then have the audacity for Zeus to be depicted as neutral good?! Excuse me?! Ancient Greece nerds disagree on a lot and we love a good interpretation but we all can agree that Zeus was shit. Yeah... Um... I’ll be doing a gripe about this. I have more to say.
