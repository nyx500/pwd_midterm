Wow, I loved this one. It was everything the Greek Mythology loving kid in me has missed. (Also trying out a new review format, so let me know what you guys think!) Plot: The story was so good! It never dragged, and wasn't predictable. The Greek Mythology was really interesting, and I thought the twist on it was fun and new. Characters: I LOVED THEM SO MUCH. Miles, the kind optimist (I wanted to be friends with him so bad). Van, the guarded tech master and protector of the group. Castor, the underdog and long lost love. And Lore, the fierce, determined, and ultimate embodiment of female power.Pacing: super fast and lots of action. This would be a great read for people who are easily bored in books.Content warnings: sexual assault, violence, death of family membersClick here for an in-depth review on my blog!*ARC received in exchange for honest review
