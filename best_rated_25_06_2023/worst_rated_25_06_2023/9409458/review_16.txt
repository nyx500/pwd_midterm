2.5 Stars!!“Mutual, respectful, enduring love is completely attainable as long as you swear you won't settle for less.” Beautiful writing as always!! But I feel like something happened with this book. It ends so abruptly that I am left feeling at a loss. An extreme loss. I am glad that I found out there is one more book in this series- otherwise I would be like WHAT THE HECK?!?! I did not find this one to be as engaging as the first two. With the second one being so action packed, I just knew this one would go out with a bang- sadly it didn't. At this point, I find Grace and Sam to be incredibly boring - and I only looked forward to Isabel and Coles POVs. So the one thing I am very excited to know is that the next book is all about Cole and Isabel- or else I would probably be done.
