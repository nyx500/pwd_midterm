** SPOILERS ** ** SPOILERS ** ** SPOILERS **This is a difficult review to write, mostly due to the fact that my fists are clenched with the need to punch Ms. Stiefvater in the face. Seriously. Plus, it's actually taken me a few days to stew on and eventually digest the strange rollercoaster ride which is Forever.So what happened? Well, there were some pacing problems. Big ones. At times the story seemed to get bogged down and Ms. Stiefvater's normally melodic prose became a little heavy handed. And while the alternating narrative added depth to the story, it occasionally made for some bumpy transitions. Again (yes, it happened in all three books). But most of these things are forgivable as, overall, Ms. Stiefvater's writing is lovely and the world she created is vivid and alive.So why the two stars? Well, now we get to the unforgivable stuff. For starters, everything worked out a little too neatly and yet, surprisingly, there were some plot threads left completely and utterly abandoned. First, let's take the situation with Grace's parents. There's zero resolution with them. None. It seemed as though there might be some, but it never quite got there and eventually the entire thread was simply dropped. Not fair, Ms. Steifvater, just because you paint yourself into a corner doesn't mean your audience should suffer. Get a grip, figure it out, spend more time in re-writes, don't just toss it away because it's more convenient that way. That's simply cheating.Second issue: the wolves. There's a hugely dramatic scene at the end of this novel, with an aerial hunt involving Mr. Culpeper. Wolves are killed. We learn of two characters that were definitely killed off and others eluded to, but it's unclear who survived. This left me scratching my head and feeling, again, a little cheated. Is it too much to ask to get some closure for characters you've introduced? Just because they were filler, and no time was taken to develop them, doesn't mean they don't count and simply get tossed by the wayside with Grace's parents.Third: the cure. Or as I like to call it: the non-cure. That's right, after Sam turns himself back into a wolf to save Grace and we're led to believe it will all work out, the cure is still... meningitis? It felt like a copout to me. Scratch that, it was a copout. And, again, I'd like to toss in the word: cheating.Fourth: Sam. He spends the entire novel vacillating. In one breath seeming to overcome his trauma and heartbreak, and in the next he's moping and griping that his life is worthless without Grace. In this installment he's reached a whole new level of morose and it's not very becoming. Ms. Stiefvater, you've turned Sam from sweet and affectionate to sadly pathetic. In your words, in this novel, Sam is truly a leaky womb.Fifth: Officer Koenig (introduced briefly in Shiver). Eleventh hour he just strolls up and says "Hi Grace and Sam, why don't you and your werewolf buddies mooch off me for the rest of your lives at this sweet little resort I own miles from nowhere"? And there's no explanation/motivation to save the wolves other than his moderate dislike for Culpeper. This stretches the bounds of plausibility to a whole new level. And, oh, what's that you ask? That's right, it's CHEATING!Sixth: Culpeper himself. Yes, I understand his role in the hunt and the necessity of that story arc but there's no resolution with this character. After all is said and done, the family just packs up and moves back to California? WTF? Okay, new adjective: unsportsmanlike. And I'm calling that a foul.Seventh: Cole. He dies. Well, sort of. Only not quite. So that makes him, what, a zombie-werewolf? Okay, maybe that's a little unfair, but under the circumstances I felt the author cheated again. No, scratch that, the author definitely cheated, and was lazy. Worst. Flaw. Ever. If you want to write a series, have the balls to see it through, otherwise don't commit. It's completely unfair to change the rules, simply because you've given up and have moved on to something else.Finally, we come to ambiguity. Aside from all the other things left unsaid and undone, I had hoped for resolution for Grace and Sam. It just wasn't there. I get that the author left it to the reader to decide their fate, and I respect that to an extent, but with so many other issues left to linger (no pun intended), I had hoped for something more tangible for this couple.Here's the crux of my issue condensed into a simple sentence: Nothing is ever earned in this novel. The characters reap rewards they have neither struggled for nor earned. They are subjected to hardships that simply vanish with no plausible explanation. They encounter tumultuous relationships which conveniently vanish into the ether. They are ostensibly left squeaky clean, because they did nothing to earn the grit they should have been slathered in. The author made them impotent by not allowing her characters to get dirty by rolling up their sleeves and doing the hard work. And it shows in every single story arc which was simply dropped for convenience sake.However, if you're a true fan of this series don't completely lose faith, here's what worked well: Cole and Isabel are the shining stars of this novel and the sole reason this received two stars instead of one. The joy was not solely due to the dynamics between the two, but because I enjoyed watching them struggle and evolve independently of each other. Their narratives offered a great peek into their respective psyches and I loved that they maintained their own unique voices throughout the novel. They were a joy to get to know and I wished more time was given to them because they absolutely saved the day where this final book is concerned.The ending, aside from the above issues, was a crazy, breathtaking adventure. Wow! Did Ms. Stiefvater hit a home run where the action is concerned! The final fifty odd pages was like being in a getaway car with fifty troopers on your tail, Thelma and Louise style! And for anyone who has read the first two books and loved them, these scenes alone are worth reading the third.As always, Ms. Stiefvater's writing is melodic and maybe I'm just being grumpy about all the other stuff... maybe.
