There are certain writers - David Mitchell, Kate Atkinson, Hilary Mantel, Chiang Rae Lee - where I think, "OK, I'll follow you anywhere, no matter how weird or improbable that place you want to take me is." A Dutch enclave in 18th century Japan? A futuristic Baltimore devoted to pisciculture? 1800 pages telling Tudor history from the vantage point of one of its better known villains? Groundhog Day set in WW2? Yes, and yes, and yes, and yes, and there you have half of my favorite books from the last decade. Ishiguro definitely holds his place in that pantheon of trust. Organ harvesting and a dystopian British boarding school? Yes! Mosleyites in an uglier (and realer) version of Downton Abbey? Yes! And so, based on that trust, I tried and tried again to give myself over to this pastiche of Arthurian legend, which has been billed as a "fantasy novel," but is told more in the limpid aphoristic tones of fable. But I failed. The writing, lyrical in places and clumping in others, tripped me up. The plot (such as it was) dragged, with the foreboding atmosphere a bit of an overmatch for the reveal at the end. The Buried Giant worked for me as concept, as meditation on memory and genocide, on love and loss. But it didn't work for me as a novel, and if Ishiguro's project was to deracinate his story so that we focused more on the concepts and less on the trappings of setting and narrative, then I think his project failed because the weird setting and characters distracted me, like a tooth that you can't stop worrying at. Even the greats stumble sometimes. Better to experiment and fail than get stuck in mediocrity.
