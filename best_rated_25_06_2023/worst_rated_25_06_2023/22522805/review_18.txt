Does 'The Buried Giant' Bury Our Own Literary One? This being Ishiguro's last novel before receiving the Nobel Award (one assumes for 'Remains' & 'Never')--the answer is a loud resounding NO!!But--It vascillates between charming & unnerving, two polar opposite Ishiguro juggles well. It's an existential apocalyptic fairytale; a Shrek-world suddenly gone earl-grey and maudlin. Colourless...It is One Wondrous Misfire. Not one to announce AT ALL what the master is actually capable of doing. Some genres just can't be taken seriously... He even switches narrative styles (in a commonly rigid uninnovative genre of fantasy fiction) pretty abruptly, suggesting the writer, too, is as annoyed by this as we. This... Tolkien-lite, impossible-to-love atrocity.
