For the first hundred pages or so I thought I was going to love this book. The idea of the old couple setting off on what amounted to a pilgrimage, the mist and the way people were losing memories and the beautifully executed writing style all added up to a possible five star read. Then just around the half way point I suddenly realised I was a little bored and was starting to skim the longer paragraphs. Part of this was that I had developed an attachment to Axl and Beatrice and did not want to listen to the musings of an elderly knight. Towards the end, when the old couple's story took the major focus again, I regained my interest and was involved enough to appreciate the way events transpired. So sadly it ends up just a three star book for me, one of those stars being entirely for the beautiful way this author uses words.
