I thought that Susanna Clarkeâ€™s Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell an exceptionally fine book, so an eventual read of this collection of short stories was always going to eventually happen. And a most enjoyable light read this has been. Typical of short story collections some hit the mark, others less so. The first tale The Ladies of Grace Adieu references Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and was in fact culled from that from the final edit. Mr Simonelli or the Fairy Widower, I thought an exceptional piece of fantasy and worth the entrance fee alone. I would love to read a full length novel of the life and adventures of Mr Simonelli if Susanna Clarke was going to maybe write something further. I thought this a very thematic tale told about the treatment of others that are dissimilar. Two other stories, Tom Brightwind and Tom Brightwind were also very good. This can be a standalone read for anyone that has not read Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell but if other readers were less keen on that book they will be indifferent to this collection, I would imagine.Late edit: after writing and posting the above, I read a very impressive review of Mr Simonelli or the Fairy Widower that is worth a look for anyone interested. https://www.revenantjournal.com/conte...
