“The governess was not much liked in the village. She was too tall, too fond of books, too grave, and, a curious thing, never smiled unless there was something to smile at.”We delve in to 19th Century England, to made-up places that are eerily similar to those that existed then and do now. The stories are all magical; some involve human magic users (Jonathan Strange himself makes a nice appearance here) and some involve those mysterious members of the Other World. Some have morals, some have enclosed story-lines and some are just stories for the purpose of being stories.I am not the biggest fan of short stories at the best of times and not even Terry Pratchett can blind me to complete infatuation with them, so I won't be praising these beyond that. However, I enjoyed them for what they were, which is dipping back in to the alternate-history world of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell.It isn't necessary to have read Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell and these stories can be enjoyed very much on their own. They're written well and have good story arcs (for shorts) and offer up a glimpse in to the kind of thing you can expect from Susanna Clarke. However, being Short Stories and being Not A Fan, I only found them so-so. Some were more interesting than others, but they're all relatively short and easy enough to get to the end of them without much strain.
