And just like that, it’s over. With The Lost Metal, Era 2 of Mistborn has come to an end.An ending well deserved for Wax and Wayne.The Lost Metal picks up six years after the events in The Bands of Mourning. Wax, no longer a lawman, is busy being a senator in the city of Elendel, and Wayne is now a member of the constabulary and partner to Detective Marasi Colms. Times have clearly changed for the two men, but when an evil god sets her sights on their home planet of Scadrial, Wax and Wayne have no choice but to return to doing what they do best – kicking major @ss, Mistborn-style.Brandon Sanderson’s finale is a non-stop adrenaline rush that most Mistborn fans will appreciate. But even more than this, the story itself is a testimony to the true meaning of friendship and selfless heroism. And for maybe the first time ever, Sanderson is finally delving into the deeper mysteries of the Cosmere universe and connecting characters and plot elements between his various worlds. The bigger picture is now a tad bit clearer.This book is all that I wanted it to be and all that I was afraid it would be. I thickened my skin, steeled my heart before reading it, and still, it wasn’t enough. I wasn’t prepared for Wax and Wayne’s ending. Sanderson broke me once again.And while I find it bittersweet to say goodbye to my beloved duo, I just learned I have much to look forward to: Sanderson has announced a third era of Mistborn.So I'll see you next time.
