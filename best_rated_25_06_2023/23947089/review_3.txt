Wonderful reread via GraphicAudio! 2022: I am not ok. All the freaking stars ⭐️ (and planets and suns) in our universe and the cosmere combined. This novel has been better than I ever dreamed, with even more cosmere crossovers than I dared hope for. As Brandon said, “The gloves are off” – the cosmere is no longer only the background. That said, I’m not sure if I would recommend reading this before knowing your cosmere… Stormlight, Elantris, Warbreaker, Emperor‘s Soul, you name it. It even helps to have read the unpublished non-canon Aether of Night. I would love to hear how people fared who don’t know their cosmere yet, though somehow I doubt The Lost Metal will hook newbies the way it hooks a cosmere veteran. I loved it so much I read through the night. And that’s not just because of the cosmere implications which enthralled me but also because of our beloved characters. All our viewpoint characters were figuring out their identity. Is Wax a lawman from the Roughs? Harmony’s sword? A father? A politician? Can he find a balance? What is Marasi’s purpose? Is being a policewoman enough for her? Can Steris turn her perceived flaw of obsessive planning into a strength – reminiscent of the talents in Alcatraz? And finally, Wayne. Can he leave his past of killing a man in his youth and the pain that has caused (him) behind?Of all those journeys our characters embark on, Wayne’s was my favorite. For whatever reason, it spoke to me the most and touched me most deeply. The prologue already prepares you for an even more vulnerable side of Wayne than previously shown; the one that has been abandoned – through death or by choice; the one that needs to put himself not in another person‘s shoes but their hats in order to live a different personality to escape his own pain and feelings of worthlessness.“I’m good at pretendin‘ to be things I ain‘t, you know? I eventually put together how to feign bein‘ a person who was worth somethin‘. It’s a good lie. Still manage to believe it. . . . Mosta the time.“We also get to understand why he is drawn to MeLaan so much: “I didn’t think I‘d ever meet someone who understood what it was like to have to be another person most of the time.”And then there is his funny side, his humorous take on life, which serves as comic relief, that has you cracking a smile. “I know her,” Marasi said. “She’s a woman of … ill repute.”“What?” Wayne said. “Who’s been saying that? Jammi has a great reputation. Of all the whores on the block, she gives the best –““I don’t need to hear the next part. Thank you.”As much as Sanderson’s characters often are his greatest magic, here, he also balances the mind-blowing cosmere revelations with character arcs and with amazing action scenes. You’d think he’d run out of ways to make allomantic/feruchemical fights interesting, but somehow he manages to find new ways that have you on the edge of your seat.What’s more, Sanderson has become an even better writer, which I didn’t think possible. Occasionally, there is also a more poetic touch to his prose which I found truly beautiful.[Wayne’s mother tells him,] “You are whatever you want to be, Wayne. You’re the wind.. You’re the stars. You are all endless things.”All in all, expectations are a bitch. But here it turns out, you are right to have them. I know I couldn’t have loved this more (except maybe if we’d seen more of Hoid); I will embark on a re-read via audiobook right away.Anna, BranSanStan.Some random thoughts:1: I want a Soonie pup called Tenny. Please, merch department, make it happen.2: I felt like Wayne‘s speech addressing the guards/watchmen at the end was a nod to Brandon’s favorite author Terry Pratchett‘s and his city watch. Made me smile.3: Telsin and her reasoning, which boils down to her being an antagonist with an understandable motive, reminds me of Taravangian - minus the hunger for power. Sanderson is so good at creating relatable “villains.” 4: I wonder if the food heists are an homage to Dan Wells and their podcast?5: At the end of chapter 30, Wayne remarks he had “[a] man‘s whole life“ - as reflected in this man‘s apartment - to figure out who that person was. Is it too far-fetched to think this quotation is an allusion to Malcalm X‘s “A man‘s whole life can be changed by one book“? Probably._____________________________October 3, 2022: The weekly release of a couple of chapters is TORTURE! Sweet, exquisite torture, but torture nonetheless. I just can’t help myself. 🙈 September 19, 2022: I honestly can't decide if I should read the chapters Tor is releasing each Monday starting today until the book's release in November or if I can wait until the entire novel is out. What is everyone else doing?? I just re-read the first two chapters that are already out with the prologue - which had me tearing up. I'm not sure I can wait till 11/15! "City folk, particularly politicians, were intimidated by small arms. They preferred to kill people with more modern weapons, like poverty and despair."Here is the link if you want to start reading as well:https://www.tor.com/2022/09/19/read-t...February 8, 2022: Sanderson reading the first chapters has just been uploaded! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSMVG... Funny and amazing! 💕 December 6, 2021: YES!!! We have a release date for the conclusion of Wax and Wayne: November 15, 2022! I can’t wait!
