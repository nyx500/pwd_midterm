Downgraded to a 3 after reflecting on it. ———I really liked the start, but my gosh does this book drag in places. Felt like it needed about 100-150 pages shaving off. The humour didn’t work for me at all. It’s quite childish humour, and given that that’s not the target market, thought it was a bit bizarre. There’s quite a lot of exposition in this book too. This took me out of the story multiple times and made the reading experience tiring. The things that saved it for me were the start and how quickly the world felt familiar. I also really enjoyed the two main female characters. A mixed bag but I’m glad I read it. I’m also happy that it’s over.Full review to come on my channel.
