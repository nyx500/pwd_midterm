2.5 starsOof this book. Itâ€™s objectively a hot mess. Objectively pretty bad, as it is:- 50% drama- 20% misunderstandings- 20% escamotage from a beautiful episode - 10% actual things happening Like, my rational side (which is 90% of my own personality) would give this one 2 stars and the series a goodbye ðŸ‘‹ BUT. It was fun. DRAMATIC FUN BUT FUN. I was honestly the popcorn.gif the whole time or most of it. I rolled my eyes a couple of times, but lord, I was entertained. If you want a break down of whatâ€™s objectively not good in this book:- the plot is thin, or even nonexistent tbh. This book is 590 pages and I could probably sum up the events in 3 sentences. - the drama has reached unbelievable highs. This book makes Clockwork Prince look tame (if it wasnâ€™t set in the early 20th century this would totally be PWP with angst on Ao3).- Clare has decided that everyone needed to be a main character. Only, you canâ€™t make 15 characters the main character, because none of them ends up having a clear and distinct voice or personality beyond a few thinly described characteristics. And this is exactly what happens here: Cordelia, James and Lucie should be the main characters but to be quite honest they werenâ€™t the most interesting ones and they werenâ€™t more well developed than say, Anna or Matthew and we know very little about the latter. But this was still fun. You could still enjoy it if you were looking for:- a lot of hot people being stupidly in love with the wrong person or believing themselves to be in love with the wrong person (or right person really, depends who you ask).- a LOVE POLYGON (donâ€™t ask me how many sides it has tbh).- Anna, light of the whole book who should 100% be the main character of this book damn. Honestly Iâ€™m ashamed of myself giving this 3 stars, but Iâ€™m trash and I fully intend to be trash for the rest of the series, because I want to see how much more fucked up it can get.
