Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! I waited too long to start this one! And as you can guess, I’m slapping at my face for three hours for my illogical delaying decision! This is brilliant, unique, captivating! I’m not gonna give so much away! But that cliffhanger broke my heart into millions of pieces! I’m still screaming and I am literally craving more! The characterization, balanced pacing, writing style, world building are fantastic!My favorite books of the author are Clockwork Princess and Lady Midnight. I can proudly say that now I found another favorite one! Took my five gazillion stars and give me the next book ASAP pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee!
