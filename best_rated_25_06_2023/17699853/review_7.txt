My new favourite book in the Shadowhunter Chronicles? I think so. I will never get over the fact that I got to read this early. What a dream come true. This was one of my most anticipated releases and it did NOT disappoint. Wow I loved everything about this book. The characters (hello new favourite character Cordelia Carstairs <3), the angst, the QUOTES (so many good quotes), the setting (1900s London), the plot (super engaging and love the antagonist), EVERYTHING! It's also so satisfying having questions answered!I can't wait for this to be released in March 2020 so everyone can read this masterpiece!Thank you so much to Walker Books Australia for sending me an early copy of this book. I am forever thankful!
