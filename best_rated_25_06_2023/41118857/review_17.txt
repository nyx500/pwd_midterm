“Rin was so tired of having to proof her humanity.”I’m taking a fantasy hiatus. I can’t remember the last time a book had me fuming like this. The Burning God better live up to its title. I’m looking forward to seeing certain people die a wonderful and slow death. Yes, I now have a death wish-list. Disclaimer to all those that haven’t read this series but still want to: I’d advise you, DON’T! But, if you REALLY want to, then do yourselves a favour and don’t get attached to no one. Trust me when say I am sparing you off unnecessary and cruel pain. I’m questioning whether it’s even a good idea to continue reading this series at this point. As much as I enjoy being tortured by a book, this series takes it to another level and quite frankly, I am just not sure whether I want to put myself through this kind of abuse. I don’t even know how R.F. Kuang wrote this with a straight face. There’s no way her feelings were present when she wrote certain scenes. It just isn’t possible. I’ll be in mourning now. Over and out.
