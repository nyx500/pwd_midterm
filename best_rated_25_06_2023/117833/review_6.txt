Love leaped out in front of us like a murderer in an alley leaping out of nowhere, and struck us both at once. As lightning strikes, as a Finnish knife strikes! She, by the way, insisted afterwards that it wasn’t so, that we had, of course, loved each other for a long, long time, without knowing each other, never having seen each other… I experienced this magical novel as an unrivalled ode to love and reveled in its delectable burlesque and hilarious scenes. It knocked me off my feet and pointed me to read Goethe’s Faust. Somewhere around 1930, the devil and his cronies descend on Moscow, putting the entire city on edge by their diabolical humor and ditto magic tricks. The authorities can only look on, powerless. Before the arrival of the devil, a “Master” wrote a novel about Pontius Pilate (this serene novel within the novel is entirely integrated in the story), which was dismissed by the regime, therefore sending the Master into a mental asylum. Margarita, the Master’s clandestine lover, makes a pact with the devil to save her companion writer. If she agrees to act as a hostess at the witches' Sabbath of the devil- naked - the devil will free her master, and Margarita and her Master will be together for all eternity and live happily ever after.By far one of the most brilliant novels I have ever read, these insipid sentences were all I was capable of writing about this astounding and greatly allegorical novel when I got a few lines in a free newspaper 10 years ago in order to promote reading, and specifically to lure ((hence the revealing of Margarita’s nakedness) readers into reading what has been thematized by the paper as former cult books - now The Master and Margarita is strongly established amongst the greatest Russian novels of the twentieth century. My copy has been residing with friends for 11 years now, and noticing write-ups on it popping up this forum almost every day, I am craving to revisit it.(Paintings by Danila Zhirov)
