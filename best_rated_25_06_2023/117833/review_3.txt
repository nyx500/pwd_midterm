welcome to...THE MASTER AND MARCHARITA!another excellent title + month pun, another paragon of literature added to my currently reading at the beginning of the month...you know what that means. IT'S ANOTHER PROJECT LONG CLASSIC INSTALLMENT (in which i read long classics segmented into smaller chunks over the course of a month to make them manageable). and this one is ordained from the heavens.my friend asked me if i had ever read this book as we stood in the middle of a three-story barnes & noble and i said no and we looked down to see the one (1) copy left in the entire store.so if i don't like it, i will be betraying not only my friend, but the universe itself.let's get into it.CHAPTER 1: NEVER TALK WITH STRANGERSoh how i love when chapters have titles.this book has 32 chapters, so it doesn't work PERFECTLY, but i'm incredibly brave and dedicated and it's pretty close, so. onward at roughly 1 chapter per day.immediately this is so cool.CHAPTER 2: PONTIUS PILATEa fairly long and extremely jesus prequel-y second chapter is a damn bold move.i see why people DNF this.CHAPTER 3: THE SEVENTH PROOFI DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.I WAS TOLD IT WOULD HAPPEN AND I DID NOT SEE IT COMING.CHAPTER 4: THE CHASEnot as climactic as the title and the immediately preceding events and the overall vibe would make it seem.CHAPTER 5: THERE WERE DOINGS AT GRIBOEDEV'Sfor those moments when the plot has really kicked off and things are shocking and violent and high-stakes and you're like, "i wish i could be reading lengthy descriptions about restaurants and the group of writers that meet there right now."CHAPTER 6: SCHIZOPHRENIA, AS WAS SAIDi feel prepared to say i have no idea what's going on.CHAPTER 7: A NAUGHTY APARTMENTthis certainly didn't bring any enlightenment.CHAPTER 8: THE COMBAT BETWEEN THE PROFESSOR AND THE POETthis was the most logical chapter yet. and it took place in an insane asylum.CHAPTER 9: KOREVIEV'S STUNTSout of the insane asylum and into the insanity.CHAPTER 10: NEWS FROM YALTAfolks, i don't know how to tell you this, but...we are 5 days behind. sometimes procrastinating a project you completely made up and assigned yourself feels a lot like self-care.CHAPTER 11: IVAN SPLITS IN TWOlet's be clear that there is nothing i would rather read about than a friend group involving a dark magic practicer, his weird annoying sidekick, and a cat. but can i not read about their trials and tribulations instead of alternating members of the russian public's reactions to them...CHAPTER 12: BLACK MAGIC AND ITS EXPOSUREi mean, this HAS to be good....the real magic trick was me predicting this would be fun from title alone!!CHAPTER 13: THE HERO ENTERSno heroes, please...i'd like to spend some more time with our bad guys...ah. the titular MASTER.CHAPTER 14: GLORY TO THE COCK!i mean...come on. it's too easy.CHAPTER 15: NIKANOR IVANOVICH'S DREAMi cannot for the life of me remember these russian-ass names. can you blame me? everyone's name has 11 consonants and 8 of them are Vs.CHAPTER 16: THE EXECUTIONpontius again...i'm at a loss.CHAPTER 17: AN UNQUIET DAYnow this is the kind of nonsense i can get behind. this is just magic and tomfoolery. i feel comfortable here.CHAPTER 18: HAPLESS VISITORSi still don't know what's going on but someone just hit someone else over the head with a roast chicken. so i have no complaints, really. how could i when literary genius is unfolding before me.CHAPTER 19: MARGARITAwe're caught up AND we've checked both of our titular boxes. what a day.CHAPTER 20: AZAZELLO'S CREAMthis chapter is dedicated in its entirety to describing the power of a nice lotion.CHAPTER 21: FLIGHTsometimes, as a woman, you have to run out of your house naked, become a witch, turn invisible, and start smashing windows. it happens to all of us.CHAPTER 22: BY CANDLELIGHTvery cool to go to the devil's house and mainly be like, "oh sick, his chessboard has animated pieces." tr√®s stoic.CHAPTER 23: THE GREAT BALL AT SATAN'Sthe absolute must-attend event of the season.CHAPTER 24: THE EXTRACTION OF THE MASTERwell. here they are. the titular duo, in the flesh, hanging out at the devil's house. and still i have no idea what this book is about.CHAPTER 25: HOW THE PROCURATOR TRIED TO SAVE JUDAS OF KIRIATHoh my god. more pontius.CHAPTER 26: THE BURIALplease, no...not more pontius...not more pontius in a long chapter on a day i don't feel like reading this...take mercy...CHAPTER 27: THE END OF APARTMENT NO. 50i'm sick today and i'm making it absolutely everyone else's problem, so...all i can say is that if this chapter so much as alludes to jesus christ's lifetime, mikhail bulgakov should live in posthumous fear.oh my god.CHAPTER 28: THE LAST ADVENTURES OF KOROVIEV AND BEHEMOTHwell, it happened. i finally got too tired of this book to go on and took a days-long break that included the entire end of march. happy april. let's finish this.CHAPTER 29: THE FATE OF THE MASTER AND MARGARITA IS DECIDEDhard to imagine a scenario in which i spend as much time, as many pages, and as significant a portion of my mental health on two characters and care this little about their "fate."CHAPTER 30: IT'S TIME! IT'S TIME!crossing my fingers that the time in question is "time for this book to be fun again."...i don't want to jinx anything, but...CHAPTER 31: ON SPARROW HILLSthe nicest thing i can say about this one is that it's like two pages long.CHAPTER 32: FORGIVENESS AND ETERNAL REFUGEi am like pavlov's dog, except instead of drooling i experience unfettered rage and instead of a bell ringing it's this f*cking book talking about pontius f*cking pilate again.EPILOGUEthank god.OVERALLthere was a lot going for this book. talking cats. tomfoolery. dark magic. big parties. annoying people eating dinner. institutes for the mentally insane. decapitation. a woman becoming a witch. the devil himself.but unfortunately none of it was enough to save itself from what was either a terrible, unforgivable translation (which, thanks to the unheeded warnings in the comments, i'm leaning towards) or a propensity to total nonsense.for the first time in this project's somewhat considerable history, i did not have fun. what a bummer.rating: 2.5
