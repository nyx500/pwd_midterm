Also my first 1 star of the year. I’ve been reading good books so far this year then this comes and ruins my streak. FUCK OFF. This book was totally and utterly pointless. I DON'T GET WHY IT EXISTS. I loved books 1 & 2, so what the hell?!!? CYA. And yes, I will be reading the last book because I own a copy.20/03/2018: lmao the time has come for me to try this book again. I put it on hold December 2016 HA. I finally got a copy of The Raven King a few days ago, so all of a sudden I got excited again for this. 2018 IS THE YEAR I READ ALL BOOKS ON MY ON-HOLD SHELF. Pray I actually finish this this time. 14/12/2016: Buddy reading with Cait ♥ (what a failed BR that was lmao)Okay so I am putting this on hold (hear that Cait and Amber? Not a DNF lol) for now. I'll be getting back to it some other day when I'm feeling it. It's been two days since I've started this and I've only read 30 pages. It was either going to put me in a slump or I wasn't going to enjoy it like I should. Besides, I'm thinking of other books to read at the moment.
