“There was something unfamiliar about him. Something ferocious about his eyes, some sort of bite in his faint smile. Something altogether hectic and unsettled. She stood on the ledge of his smile and looked over the edge.”Even though I always feel like I don't understand a thing that is going on in those books, they are just beautiful. Maybe exactly because I don't understand a thing: They always surprise me, I never know what to expect next but I am never let down.I think this third installment was the best so far. I love to see the friendships and more-than-friendships grow. I really hope that Ronan and Adam are going to be a thing! Though I still think that Ronan is an asshole, he just makes me angry...And wow what this book made to my heart! I don't know what was stronger: my love for the characters or my fear they would die. Because Lord I was bloody scared! Worse than any horror movie. Imagination is a strong thing.The books are not perfect but they have this incredible atmosphere of mystery and magic, danger and adventure that make me adore Maggie Stiefvater as an author.
