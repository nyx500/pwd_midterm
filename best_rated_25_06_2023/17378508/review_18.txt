im so, so sad to admit this but… i think im slowly losing interest in this series. this book wasnt bad by any means, but i think the novelty and uniqueness is just wearing off for me. i found myself not really invested in the search for glyndŵr, which is a shame because the plot finally advances in this book! and again, ive wanted more on blues curse since ‘the raven boys,’ but shes hardly a focal point - shes only around when the boys do something. im going to finish the series because its only one more book, so heres hoping its worth it!3.5 stars
