This book deserves a longer and more praised review!5 STARS!**But here’s the thing. It’s the end of the year and I’m soooooo tired.** 🤷🏼‍♀️🤣😂The Shadow of the Gods is the first book in a new series by John Gwynne called Bloodsworn Saga.It’s fantastic, it’s bloody, and it's violent. It has everything that I want in a fantasy book.**In my opinion, this book should have won the fantasy category on Goodreads. shaking my damn head**Here's a list of all the fantastic things in this book:✔️ Amazing characters!✔️ A well thought out and immersive world that’s set in a Norse/Viking setting.✔️ Bloody and gory battles!! Seriously, it would be amazing to go back in time and see these types of battles. Woah.✔️ Old Gods that fought each other to the death. They all have different traits and skills of animals:fox, bear, wolf, eagle, rat, dragon, hound, etc.And in this world 300 years later, these Gods had children and their legacy are considered “tainted” and are used as slaves and controlled by slave collars.✔️ Great and fantastic creatures:sea serpents, giant ass spiders, weird little flying creatures that like teeth, trolls, etc!Seriously, this book is awesome!The pacing is great, the characters are wonderful and I’m so excited for book 2, The Hunger of the Gods.It can’t get here soon enough!
