Full Video Review Here: https://youtu.be/BscxDMH2BJQI received an ARC from Orbit in exchange for an honest review.With The Faithful and the Fallen firmly entrenched into my Top 10 fantasy series of all time, John Gwynne stepping out of the Banished Lands for the first time was kind of bittersweet. As my second favorite working modern fantasy author today, I'm all aboard when it comes to Ol' Vicious Pen starting up a new series. But would it just make me long for Corban and the gang again?Not even close.With the first book in the planned Bloodsworn trilogy, Gwynne hits us with a living, breathing fantastical world wrapped up in Viking and Norse culture and lore and gives us his usual dose of incredible action, intriguing new characters, and more twists and turns than in the coils of a giant sea serpent.While more grounded in scope than previous series, Bloodsworn focuses on just three POV character this go around. Orka, a trapper with a mysterious past trying to lead a quiet life with her family. Elvar, a shieldmaiden that has left her lie in nobility in search of battle fame. And Varg, a new recruit into the renowned Bloodsworn who seeks revenge upon those who have taken a member of his family away.While grounded in a smaller cast of characters than his previous works, the same grim fantasy elements that separate Gwynne from other modern fantasy authors are very much still prevalent. Creatures of incredible imagination, both familiar and unique, as well as a look at the lifestyle of Viking culture and mythology.Shadow of the Gods is one of the best new world setups I can remember reading in the last decade. Never rushed and leaving you wanting more, John Gwynne's first steps outside of the Banished Lands seem to be giant leaps.Highest of recommends and I can't wait for Dead Gods Rising in 2022.
