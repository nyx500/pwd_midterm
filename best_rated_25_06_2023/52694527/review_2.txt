First, the usual caveat: I received a free Advance Reading Copy of this book from the publisher. I do not think that affects my review of this book.First book in a trilogyThis is a world I would love to step into. It's dangerous, wondrous and populated with strange creatures, some possibly loyal allies and others vicious antagonists. The backdrop of the tale is stunning in its scale; I don't think it's a spoiler to say that a city may grow within the skull of a fallen god. The magic and power of the fallen gods are everywhere, as both traps and treasures for those who encounter it. That divine heritage of bones and bloodlines is not always visible, nor always a blessing. Kings, queens and jarls struggle for power, but the reader witnesses all from the viewpoints of a smallholder, a slave and a nobleman's daughter who has escaped family constraints to command her own fate. As the three tales of these divergent characters begin to converge, reader anticipation can only rise for the next two volumes in this story. Highly recommended. I enjoyed the diverse viewpoints of characters from very different social strata and expectations.
