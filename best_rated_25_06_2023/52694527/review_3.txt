I've read quite a few of John's books now, and liked each one a bit more than the last.This is a fine read, and if you've read any of his other work then you'll find this to be very definitely a Gwynne book with all the stuff you liked from the other books, only more.We follow three point-of-view characters on journeys that stay separate for most of the book. The setting is ... well, it's very Viking. The pseudo Vikings are firmly grounded in Gwynne's own fascination with the subject, with what feels like authoritative descriptions of arms, armour, clothing, battle methods, lifestyle etc. The gods (which took the forms of colossal animals) are dead but their blood still runs in the veins of many, granting a range of magics and battle-skills.Two of the main characters run with separate mercenary bands and the camaraderie is well portrayed along with plentiful scraps, duels, shield walls and the like. The enemies range from other warbands to trolls, ice spiders, and a wide variety of magical beasties, including some rather fearsome tooth fairies!It's a good tale with mounting tension, a slowly revealed plot, unexpected twists, and plenty of bloodshed. It's also definitely the foundation of a larger story with many elements left unresolved for the subsequent titles to chew over.John Gwynne is very definitely the closest we have to an inheritor of David Gemmell's mantle as master of heroic fantasy with grit and heart.(Gwynne also wins the contest for having testicles feature most prominently in a fight.)
