Re-read in February 2022..Still fantastic! Thank you Orbit books for the arc on book #2My thanks to Orbit books, John Gwynne and Netgalley. I haven't even the words to describe what a standout this story is! For me, the book cover best describes my thoughts! That little person, standing on the mound against the big bad! That's how this felt! This was pure adrenaline. I never read much Viking stuff. Love the show! This is based on Nordic mythology. But even more. This book made me tense. It is grimdark at its most hurried, no breaks, kill, maim, and die. It was freaking fantastic, and I need more! Also, I am completely annoyed by how much I've come to love these people. Especially as this is only the first book and I know some will break my heart by being killed horribly. Can't wait! Best book I've read this year!
