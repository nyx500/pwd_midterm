"Everything's a risk."In the Seven Realms, truer words have never been spoken.4.5 stars I'm so sad to see the Seven Realms series come to an end.Mystery! Intrigue! Adventure! Danger! Magic! Fighting! Forbidden Love! How many rounds of awesome can we squeeze into one book? I don't know the final tally but the count is high (along with the dead bodies). Han is incredible. Were it not for him, this series wouldn't have had the same edge to it. Everyone likes to root for the underdog, and Han had a full deck stacked against him. His ability to take repeated life-beatings and keep on pushing forward endeared him to many a reader. And it didn't hurt that he had crazy ninja skills.As if in answer to her prayers, someone swarmed across the ceiling of the cathedral, swinging from one fixture to another, finding handholds where none existed. He dangled over their heads, arrows pinging all around him, then dropped to the floor.I'm still a softie for Amon though. I like those protective types. Always have. Maybe he wasn't all magic flash and ninja technique, but he'll always have a place in my heart. I wish he'd almost had his own part of the story, since he was such a focus in the first book.The best part about Crimson Crown was that it gave us plenty of happy without crossing every t and dotting every i. We got enough to satisfy without knowing exactly how everything in the future would be laid out. "I want to breathe you in for the rest of my life."Few authors know how to end a series right and this is one of them. Happy cheer for a job well done!Sometimes a dream is enough.
