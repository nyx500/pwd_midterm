Ahhh you guys... this was amazing.  Ok but first I must fangirl..That. Dance. Scene. Holy blazers. This isn't going to be a long review... but I hope to express just how epic this journey has been.I'm not even kidding... I got teary eyed at the end. -Mild Spoilers-Raisa's journey has been incredible. She is a heroine that I seriously LOVED rooting for. I was not at all disappointed as her journey came to a close. I felt so connected to her and in the end I just wanted all her sacrifices and pain to be worth it- and it WAS.Oh and Han. What a man. Can we just applaud him for the fact that he made Raisa wait until he married her? He refused to be a backstreet lover. He refused to watch her be married off to another man and meet her in private. He made her a vow and he kept it. And he FOUGHT for her... non stop... UGH I can't. My only complaints are that I wanted much more of Micah (I still believe he's a good guy and he got pushed off... I mean he DID save Raisa several times...) and Amon... after all that emotional turmoil, I just feel heartbroken over him. I feel very dissatisfied with his ending... we deserved more. Also, the writing was so deep and intricate but I feel like many scenes could have been much shorter. I don't need every footstep of every journey described. But whatever... I loved this anyway. So in the end.. this was an INCREDIBLE and emotional journey and I can't believe I waited so long to read these. My Blog ~ Instagram ~ Twitter ~ Etsy
