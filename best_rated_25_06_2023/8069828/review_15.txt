This has been such an amazing, compelling ride. I started the series earlier this year and I’m so so glad to have made that decision. Following Han and Raisa was long and occasionally difficult but the end results are completely worth it. This world is so well thought out and it makes me happy to know there’s a companion series that I can start now that I’ve finished the Seven Realms!
