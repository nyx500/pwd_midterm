Codex Alera really deserves a bump :)That's a spoiler-less review I wrote a few years ago that sums up my thoughts of this amazing series. I hope more people read this great series.It’s a really great book with lots of action and lots of fun. Definitely among the best books written by Jim Butcher, so prepare yourself for this big battle, because most of it is a super-awesome battle. The series ends up while all the loose ends are tied up pretty well, but there’s still an option for one more series, and I really hope Butcher will get back to this world someday. So what we had in this series:Great action – check.Excellent writing – check.Superb plot – check.Humor – check.Compelling characters – Definitely check here. The series has one of the best cast of characters I've ever seen, there’re so many characters that I really like.It really feels like Jim Butcher wrote this series especially for me, like he knows exactly what makes me enjoy reading fantasy so much:)The book deserves a perfect score of 5/5.
