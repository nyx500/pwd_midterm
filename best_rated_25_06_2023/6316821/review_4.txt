This is the final book in the series & it did sum everything up nicely - too nicely. Butcher is just too attached to some of his characters. While that makes this a fun read, it lacked any depth of emotions for me.  I was never worried that a major, well-loved character could die. In this series, almost no one dies - ever. They're constantly getting killed, but then magically revived. It just took all the suspense out of it. C'mon Butcher, grow a pair! Life isn't fair.There were also a lot of magical fixes & a few things that didn't make any sense at all. So, not a great story, but still fun & a pretty neat world. I've heard that Butcher said he put together Roman Legions & Pokemon as the basis of the world. I can see that. Overall, I give the series a 'pretty good' rating. Certainly not a 'must read' but it would make a good set of books for the beach.
