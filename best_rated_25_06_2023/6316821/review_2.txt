I put off reading this for as long as possible because I didn't want it to end. And, well...I didn't want any of my favorite characters to die.But nobody died. NOBODY died. <--except the queen and some of the people that you hated.Like, even the likable characters that I just knew were going to have to die? Nope. Still alive.Which makes me feel a lot better about Dresden eventually coming to an end.And I'm sure that will probably upset some of you, but I couldn't give less of a shit about things being realistic in that sense. Yell if it makes you feel better, though. Alright. So those of you who are reading the series already know this, but for those of you who don't know, Codex Alera a mash-up of a bunch of seemingly oddball stuff to put together in one story.The Roman Legion & Senate: High Fantasy: Pokemon: Invasion of the Body Snatchers: And even a bit of Romance:That's nuts, right?! I have absolutely ZERO explanation as to why it works, but it does. I loved these characters and I loved this world. And this was pretty much a perfect ending.Or as close to it as an author can get.I don't know who the fuck I'd recommend this to in a generic way, but if you're in the market for something off the wall in fantasy? Yeah.Recommended!
