A great end to the series! Over all, it was fun to read, despite the narrative to have veered from time to time in directions more distracting then actually adding to the story . The characters were fun and likable, the Fantasy had a bit of Science Fiction thrown in it, and the tendency of the author to put our protagonists through the ringer and up to the edge of despair, was consistent from book one to the end. I am glad I had the time to read it and enjoy another Fantasy World!
