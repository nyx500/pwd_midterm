This whole series by Jim Butcher was wonderful and entertaining. I enjoyed the characters the most. They were all so intricately woven in and attached to each other. They were all easy to like and better yet, they were characters you could root for. The battles between good and evil were strong and this pulled me in.This book is the last in this series and the author brought closure to everyone. The ending was a little too sweet and somehow, even with all the battles, everyone (meaning the main characters) all survived relatively unscathed. If one had met their demise, I might have been a little more emotionally tied to this, but still.....all in all..... a well crafted creative story by one of my favorite authors. So 4 stars.
