I can't deny that I read this book in one sitting, and that the narrative was absorbing. Briggs is a good writer. But by the next morning, all I could think of were complaints. I suspect I'll be in the minority in disliking this, though.There's no Stephan at all. Maybe the author thinks everybody is sick of vampires. I'm not. I'm sick of the damned Fae. Their presence has ruined this series for me. They're too otherworldy and overly-magical for the kind of urban fantasy I enjoy. I've always liked Zee pretty well, but I disliked extremely the whole long sequence with the Fae towards the end of this book. The previous book revolved around the Fae also, but at least it had a better overall plot than this one.I don't like that Briggs has made her werewolves have split personalities. I can see that a werewolf would think of himself as having a different identify when he transforms, but to give the inner wolf an actual separate personality is taking that too far. And while I usually like pack dynamics, they were fairly pathetic here.Finally, I didn't like the pat resolution to the Samuel problem. I felt unsatisfied and disappointed at the end of this book, and I won't be jumping to buy the next one as soon as it releases.
