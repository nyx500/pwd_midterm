These books are awesome and should be mandatory reading by everyone.I first read this trilogy(Lirael is a second book in the old kingdom trilogy; Sabriel is first while Abhorsen is the finale) when I was in middle school and I have to admit I'm just as obsessed with this series now as I was then.With a cast of fantastic characters and a quick moving pace(mostly), you are truly sucked into the world of the old kingdom and it's pretty scary. I'm truly surprised that this book can be considered YA cause it's a extremely dark tale that's leads up to a jaw dropping revelation(not really you can guess it almost immediately, I just wanted to entice you into reading it).I listened to the audio version and Tim Curry makes everything so much better, he totally knows how to perfectly creep you out when he wants to. He is an absolutely perfect choice for the audio narration; word of advice listen to him read with all the lights off while your in bed alone and I guarantee you will get the wiggens.ProsCharacters, prose, audio narration, character development, Death, the library of the Clayr, paceConsPace can be a little iffy sometimes
