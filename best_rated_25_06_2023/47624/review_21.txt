Loved the characters, new and old, but this one is ultimately a very long prologue to book 3. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I am really excited for book 3 now, but I also got to the end and thought, Huh. Did that just introduce the drama that is coming? Listened to the audiobook which is again read by the fabulous Tim Curry!
