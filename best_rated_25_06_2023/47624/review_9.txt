Well.....okay. Not as good a book as Sabriel, I went with 3 stars on this one. It was close as the story is a pretty good one and we are still following the plot line thrown out in Sabriel, just not quite as well (in my opinion of course).We pick up about 14 years after end of that volume and we sort of get an introduction like, 14 years have passed. there have been many battles as the King (Touchstone) who married Sabriel (the Abhorsen) overthrows evil, saves the Kingdom and aids the people. At the same time the Abhorsen has faced many terrible dangers, binding the dead and destroying awful necromancers. Really. That might have made a good book. Why didn't you tell us that story???? No we get to start over with another uncertain (even more uncertain) young woman. She constantly bemoans her situation, considers killing herself (but decides that throwing herself off a glacier might not really be the way to go), makes constant bad decisions that seem to work out for her and so on and on and on. And of course a young man who's managed to get himself so scared of his "expected future" that he's paralyzed at the very thought of it...and he won't go to the very people/person who might be able to help him with it.I'll be honest, I got sick of Lirael's constant woe is me I don't have the sight... Yes it would be awful to go through what she did, to face what she faced. But between her constant bemoaning of her fate and Sam's refusal to talk to his parent's when he had the chance (I'll wait till morning...oops they're already gone) about something that could threaten EVERYBODY... well, it got a bit tiring.This book may be (and I hope is as I'm beginning the third book Abhorsen) suffering from the well know "second book in a trilogy" syndrome. It's a bit long winded, a bit drawn out and a bit (for me) tiresome. I like good YA fantasy and the first in this series was certainly that. This for me told a pretty good story but could have done it better in maybe two thirds the length...just me possibly.Three stars, not bad, a fairly interesting story that tells us more of the world and it's people, hope the next strikes me better.************* Spoiler below line *************************I think the point at which I went totally from 4 stars to 3 here was when Lirale discovers that she is the Abhorsen in waiting her first reaction is "so I'll never get the sight?" Sort of ticked me off. I was hoping Nix would give her the sight just so she'd stop worrying (herself and us)over it.
