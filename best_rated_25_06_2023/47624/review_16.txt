A wonderful YA fantasy. Beautifully told, with so many exciting and powerful moments. The clues to Lirael's and Prince Sameth's real identities are hinted at and gradually revealed to the reader, till we realise all at the climactic (but kinda cliffhanger) ending. The mysterious Library of the Clayr is one of fantasy's iconic imaginings, and one of my favourite book settings. The section when Lirael makes her big discoveries is so magical and beautifully paced. I love the world Nix has created, For me, this book is the best of the series, and the Disreputable Dog is one of his best creations.
