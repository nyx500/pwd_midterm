That was a fun read with nonstop action from start to finish. Better than book one which was very good in it's own right. I look forward to book three which has a lot to live up to. There's still so many story lines and people in flux. Abilities not yet completely defined. McCellan has a very fluid writing style. Not fancy or poetic but the flow is terrific.
