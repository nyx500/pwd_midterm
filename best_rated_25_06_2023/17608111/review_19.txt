Book 2 of this series down! While I am enjoying it, each of the first two books took me forever to get through. I am not sure what it is, but it just felt like I was never making any progress. Usually it only feels that way when I don’t like a book.Also, I am amazed when I look at the giant brick of a book sitting on my desk and think, “Hmmmm, not much happened in that book for that many pages.” Again, not a bad thing, it just seems like there would have been much more story progress than there was.Another thing that I encountered can probably be best described as middle book syndrome. When I started it, I was having a hard time remembering some of the specifics from the first one, but I really got into it after 100 pages or so. There are still some story elements than I just ended up as accepting without remembering exactly what happened from one book to the next. Then, I get to the end, and, well . . . the book basically didn’t end. There was some climatic stuff, but it is mostly just leading into the next part of the story.Seems like I am not speaking very positively about this book so far, but it is good! The magic in it is intriguing and the story elements unique. I am not sure if conventional fantasy fans will enjoy it, but I think those who like steampunk, military-based, and/or political based fantasy will find a lot to offer in this series.I will be finishing the series, but I am in a catch-22. I feel like I should read it soon so I don’t forget parts of it like I did between book 1 and 2, but I am not yet ready to get bogged down in another 600 page brick – no matter how interesting it ends up being!
