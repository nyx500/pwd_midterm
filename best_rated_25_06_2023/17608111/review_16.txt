It took me a while to publish it but here is the full review on the book!https://todaysdecameron.wordpress.com...I immensely enjoyed the first book of the series Promise of Blood; and I was fearing to be disappointed. Silly me! This book was sublime, action, fast pace in the development (better, right pace for the development of the situations because it never felt like I needed more information), drama, magic, powder (duh!) and grief.  Yes, I actually spilled a little tear for Mihali and I did not expect that to happen! But I wonder: Can gods really die in this world, even when the power is wielded by another god? I am so hyped for book three!
