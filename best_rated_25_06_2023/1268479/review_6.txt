4.5 I always have a hard time reviewing Brandon Sanderson's books. As always the world building and the magic system is what makes this book amazing. I really liked the story and the twist I didn't see coming. I would totally recommend this books and cannot wait for the sequel since the title is the name of one of my favorite character... a talking sword :P
