Sooo, now that I have read it for the second time, I'm not as blown away as I was when I read it for the first time. (See the review below where I had my initial meltdown).BUT, Sanderson still remains a genius. I mainly read this since I'm rereading his Cosmere books to prepare for when I eventually read Rhythm of War. I really hope we get a sequel soon for this. (Preferably with Nightblood having a POV).The ending was beautiful!---------------SANDERSON, YOU FUCKIN' GENIUS! *sobs* I can't review this book. I refuse to! How in gods earth do I form coherent sentences when my mind has been obliterated into pieces?! I'm in damn awe! My emotions are in a state of frenzy! If you haven't jumped on the bandwagon that is Brandon Sanderson, you haven't lived. Over and out.
