lets play six degrees of brandon sanderson! i will go first - i recently found out that my dads brothers wifes brother is childhood best friends with brandon and they still are close to this day. so much so that my cousins have met him, got books signed, etc. after hearing about this, i felt obligated that my next read should be one of his novels. i mean, we are practically family. lol. after ‘elantris,’ its so amazing to see how much sanderson has developed as a writer and author since his debut novel. the incredible creativity is still present, but it just feels more refined in this story. i thought the magic system and fantasy elements were much more fully explored and developed, with all the court politics and war strategising as a support for the plot (and not the other way around). this just feels like a much stronger story, and one i really enjoyed. im still not sure im a fan of his pacing, which seems to be a constant for his books (or so i have heard). i understand the slow buildup, simmering, until everything culminates into one giant explosion of action towards the end. but, similar to his debut, it makes the ending feel rushed to me. its not necessarily disruptive, but it definitely is a lot to take in all at once. and even though i felt like everything was rushed, i actually really appreciate that the story was nicely wrapped up, but that the epilogue also provided a segue for a sequel. i hate cliffhangers with a passion, so sanderson gets a gold star in my book for the conclusion (not necessarily how he concluded, but just that everything was concluded in general).ive been putting off the mistborn series for a while now, so i guess its now finally time to pick it up!↠ 4.5 stars
