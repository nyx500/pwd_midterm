Urgh... Middle book syndrome! I love this world very much and the characters even more. I enjoy politics and battles and magic a lot and can subsist for a long time on just the micro elements of good stories. But this? Nothing happened. The book ended with many of the main characters a mere step from where they began--Gavin from captured to captured; Kip from fleeing to fleeing, Betrayers continue to betray, and there are a few "oh, snap!" moments here, but they're a little bit expected (looking at you, big guy) and not quite as punchy because you feel like redemption is there even before the betrayal sinks in. The most fascinating reveal is that Andross isn't quite the puppet master we thought, at least not the only one. But we mostly hate him, so it's not quite as fun. I understand the need for middle books. I really do. And, in spite of everything bad I have to say about this, **i still enjoyed it.** You will too. But, objectively, this was a bit of a disappointment from someone with as much talent as Weeks.
