4.0 StarsSpoiler-Free Series Review Video: https://youtu.be/OosD4rbJJEsI liked a lot of the twists and turns in this third entry. While not a perfect series, I thought this one was much stronger than the previous book, particularly in terms of the female characters. I read this one incredibly fast because I was just so hooked in by the various storylines. At this point, I love several of the protagonists and love to hate the villains even more.
