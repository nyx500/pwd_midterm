I couldn't stop reading it, couldn't stop thinking about it once I had to put it down. And when I finally was able to stop thinking about it, I was asleep, which in my opinion was wasted time I could have spent with Oraya and Raihn and Mische and the cruel world this book takes place in.The Serpent and the Wings of Night is a lethal mix of elements that put together make one of the best adult fantasy/vampire novels I've ever read; good writing? Check. Fantasticly layered main and side characters? Check. Evocative setting and intriguing political intrigue? Check. A bloody Hunger Games-like challenge and scary beasts? Double check. A complex romance and some sexy situations? Check check checkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.The enemies to allies to lovers to enemies is so well done it made me wanna cry. There's some spice, too, towards the end, and it's of my favorite kind: not overly graphic or lengthy. I think gifted authors could make anything sexy, it they wanted, without needing to write super explicit smut, and Breadbent is on this list.There's a certain sparring session scene that probably wasn't supposed to be sexy (not too much, at least), that left me panting and blushing.That's what I call talent.And speaking of talent...The plot blew me away completely.I'm still trying to process that ending.
