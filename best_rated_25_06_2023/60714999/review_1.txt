sarah janet walked so this brutal shit could runi've had a hard time finding a fantasy romance to satisfy me. they often lack proper world building and fantasy elements or the relationships feel rushed and unjustified. and let's be honest, i'm a notoriously picky bitch.but this book was pretty satisfying on all fronts. a fairly complex political system with vampires being the ruling class. in- fighting amongst vampire factions. a hunger games-esque competition. relentless brutality. and a compelling romantic relationship that i couldn't help but root for. oh and don't let me forget about the complex father-daughter relationship!!!my only complaint is that i wish we had a little info dumping early on. weird to ask for, but i wanted to better understand the reason for the Hiaj/Rishan conflict. i get that bloodthirsty power thirsty beasts can just be mean to be mean but i think it would have helped me to understand the stakes more if we knew more about the differences between factions/species.otherwise? fantastic. and i'll be picking up the sequel when it comes out :)
