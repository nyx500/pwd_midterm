"My friend. My enemy. My lover. My captor. King and slave. Human and vampire." I have no words except that I LOVED IT. It was absolutely perfect.  Love the series ACOTAR? FBAA? Hunger Games?  Pick this up right now. I promise you won't even regret reading it, it's so so worth it. 🥺🥺  I personally think it's better than FBAA  ✔️ Hate to love✔️ Slow burn- angsty ✔️ Witty banter ✔️ World building✔️ Vampires (with wings)✔️ Magic✔️ Action packed ✔️ Tending to his wounds ✔️ Drama  "I would beg. For you, I would. You have destroyed me, Oraya. Do you know that?" Our  FMC, Oraya  is human and raised by the vampire king, Vincent. Entering the tournament called Kejari, held by the goddess of death; Oraya wants to be something more. All she has to do is defeat the vampire warriors of the three houses; where she meets  Raihn, our MMC  and of course a vampire. Everything about him alludes power, charm, and enemy to the king. As their paths collide and an alliance is formed complications arise. Honestly, I loved every minute of it and every page of it. From the first chapter till the last one, it stayed  consistent, intense and action packed.  It's paced in a balanced manner- where things need to be fast, it is fast and where things need to be slow, it is slow. The world building is so interesting. And honesty I was glad that for a change the word "fae" wasn't mentioned, cause lately everything has been fae and it's started to grow old.  Not that I'll stop reading them.  The author wrote this in such an immaculate manner, I was fully immersed. The book is big but it doesn't bore one with unnecessary details.  "I give you my body. I give you my blood. I give you my soul. I give you my heart. From this night until the end of nights. From daybreak until our days are broken. Your soul is my soul. Your heart is my heart. Your pain is my pain. I bind myself to you."  The  romance  is so moving. The chemistry is perfect. Oraya and Raihn bring life to the book. Tho they're very similar to the dynamic of Feyre and Rhysand, it is still fun and lively. I would say that  Oraya  is more of an original personality, cause her zeal and her humanity is what makes her stand out. She has got tricks up her sleeve as well and radiates grump energy tbh lol.  Raihn's  personality, similar to Rhysand. I love Rhysand, I love Raihn too. There are a lot of other similarities between the two- the way they carry themselves, the wings, the banter and their motives. Tho he may not sound original, he has the potential to win you over and trust me, he will. Septimus is an interesting character and pretty sure we're going to see more of him. But am not a fan of his name 🙈 Mische, is like Mor. That's all I'll say lolThe  ending  was so tense and full of drama. I could not put the book down at all. The plot twists had me screaming 😩😩 I seriously cannot wait to read the next book. Y'all just read it.  Highly recommended.  This is high key the best book I read so far this year.
