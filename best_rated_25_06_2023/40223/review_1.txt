I stayed up until 8 o'clock in the morning to finish this book. I literally could not put it down, it didn't even occur to me. This book was fan-freakin-tastic and I definitely consider it among my few favorites.I already loved (and hated, in some cases) these characters. They already felt real to me. I know some people will read this series and say that some of the characters are without flaws, but I don't care. I followed Phedre and Joscelin into the most realized interpretation of Hell I have ever experienced. Seriously, as they were traveling there, I had chills and I was shivering. When they lived there, I felt so sick I could barely bear to keep reading. This particular version of Hell was just a distant country feared by everyone else, but I think it was supposed to represent a Hell on Earth, and it did. She went there because she knew her God, Elua, was calling her to...I dug the prophet vibe, and I got (yet again) chills when Carey described the feelings that came over Phedre when she realized what she had to do. Its so funny I know, that I found so much religious meaning in a book so full of strange gods.Anyway, absolutely brilliant end to this trilogy of the series. I ended it more than half in love with both Phedre and Joscelin, and I dare you to read them and not feel the same.
