A powerful conclusion to this epic trilogy. It got very dark in the middle, so much so that I did put it down for a while, but i’m so glad I continued. Carey’s writing is so beautiful it brought me to tears at the end. Such friendship, such tragedy and yet such joy to be had. Everything about this trilogy is bittersweet and all the more emotionally powerful for it. The characters are so well developed and remain true to their histories throughout, shaped and destroyed by the events that unfold. Joscelin. Joscelin is my favourite. The world, religions and mythology are excellently crafted and I loved visiting Egypt, Venice, Cyprus, Croatia, among others!, and how the separate mythologies we know today intertwined in this story and came to this beautiful conclusion. Very good :)
