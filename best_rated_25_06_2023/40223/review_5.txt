Not quite a 5-star read but my favorite of the trilogy. The writing is nearly superb for most of the book, with so much meaning and depth packed into each sentence, and with every arc that began in the first book coming to a head, there's never a dull moment. It's pretty much edge-of-your-seat action for the last 500 pages. However, as much as I love this book, there's a good chunk--about 300 pages--I will never ever read again. Ever. Drujan. Darsanga. That zenana. *shudders*
