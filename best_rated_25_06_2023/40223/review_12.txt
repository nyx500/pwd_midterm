You either die a phenomenal fantasy series hero, or live long enough to see yourself become an overwritten sleeping pill which forgets what made it phenomenal in the first place the villain.Kushiel's Avatar sadly just fell completely flat as an ending to one of my favourite fantasy trilogies that I've read. The first book was exceptional, the second almost as good, and the third made the risky choice of removing everything that was good about the personal drama and political intrigue and slow and careful building of the first two in favour of a one-dimensional world-spanning double fetch quest.At times it seemed quite interesting, hyping up the mysterious land of Drujan as one of the most intriguing locations in this fictional world, deep in the mountains of alternative Persia. And that, more than anything, crashed into complete and utter disappointment by holding just a slightly more depraved, but ultimately extremely dull, court than the ones we have visited in Terre d'Ange and La Serenissima.Ah, well. You can't win 'em all.
