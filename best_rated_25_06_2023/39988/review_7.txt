My first read of 2022, and I ADORED it! One of my reading goals for 2022 is to read classics (and books in general) that have been on my TBR for ages! I’ve been wanting to read Matilda for such a long time, but for some reason I never did! I’m incredibly happy to say that I finally have read it and loved every second!Roald Dahl is such a fantastic writer, and I can’t wait to read many more of his books in the future!My favorite thing about this story was the mention of other books, especially Nicholas Nickleby and how Mrs. Trunchbull resembled Mr. Squeers! Such a funny and brilliant book!
