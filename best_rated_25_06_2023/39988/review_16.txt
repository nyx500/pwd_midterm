well, well, well. if it isn't our collective villain origin story.many of roald dahl's books have hit me hard, for varying reasons: their being the inspiration for a perfect stop-motion film by wes anderson; an uncharacteristic and mild lifelong interest in world war II; an appreciation for large kind men.but none for a reason better than this one.i was, as i'm sure many of you were too, an incredible nerd in childhood. an indoors kid. a dork. in other words, a bookworm. and this book was like, hey. you know your favorite thing in the world? the hobby you like doing more than anything else (and it's not close)? not only is that thing cool, contrary to prior belief, but it will also make you magic. and because of it you will be adopted by the best person on earth and eat chocolates along the way.so good.part of a series i'm doing in which i review books i read a long time ago
