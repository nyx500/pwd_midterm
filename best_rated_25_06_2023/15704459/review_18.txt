My name is David Charleston.I kill people with super powers.Sanderson has done it again!When superheroes start coming after them bearing clues that draw them to a city named Babylon Restored, ruled by a woman named Regalia, the Reckoners of Newcago join the branch of Reckoners to find out why, after so many years of good living in the city, suddenly Regalia is trying to destroy everything she has built.I love this series. The new take on superheroes where power corrupts is a refreshing change from Marvel/DC, and the protagonist David is a nerdy, awkward teenager that I find hilarious, with his terrible "metaphors".She looked at me, her electricity flaring to life-growing more violent, more dangerous, lighting the room like a calzone stuffed with dynamite.I mixed with ordinary people about the same way that a bucket of paint mixed with a bag of gerbils.While I can't say I enjoyed this quite as much as the first one as I found the "I just know she's a good person because she's beautiful and I love her!" rather cheesy, I do have to cut David some slack as he is a hormone ridden teenager.That being said, this book was full of action and new superheroes, including Dawnslight, one of the most interesting so far. It also features new characters, including Mizzy, who I daresay is more awkward than David (such a thing is possible!) and adorable.Write like an oscillating fan set to high Brandon. I need book three.Cross posted at Kaora's Corner.
