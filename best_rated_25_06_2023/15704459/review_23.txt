*** 4.40 ***A buddy read with the superheroes from BB&B! Brandon Sanderson is one of the most imaginative and entertaining contemporary fantasy authors. And this is not a compliment. It is just a fact and I think it should be universally accepted and we should just move on... Young Adult, evil Superheroes, post-apocalyptic like event, puny humans fighting for their right to exist... Not truly my cup of tea, but boy does Sanderson make it a fun ride!!! Throughout the whole book I know things were not going to be what they seemed, but none of my guesses penned out and I am happy for it. He never stops to engage and surprise us, and I have nothing but respect for the deceptive ease he does it with. I have to once again stress that I DO NOT belong to a Sanderson cult and will never give up said cult's secret handshake, no matter under what torture! There are also blood tests and DNA splicing, but as I said, I am not a member... David, with some new and even more ridiculous metaphors, and the gang are back, with a very grumpy Prof at the helm of the operation, and they are headed to New Babylon, or as we know it New York... Couple of new characters are introduced from the Reckoners cell there and I actually really liked Mizz:-) The world building in that city is sooo cool, and the reason behind it, unexpected:) We get to deal with the evil Epics in charge of that region and lets face it, it is Sanderson, so the book gets to take us on an unforgettable ride! I never give spoilers in my reviews, so I will recommend this book and series to all ages and genders alike! You can not go wrong with this fun, imagination driven, and action enhanced series, which you will have to read in order. No excessive are gratuitous violence and no sexy times, so kids will enjoy it as much as the adults, but maybe for different reasons:) I wish you all a wonderful time discovering the wonders of Brandon Sanderson's imagination! Happy reading!
