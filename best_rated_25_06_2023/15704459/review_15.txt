Damn... I forgot how amazing this book is. _____________________________I just knew I should not have done this to myself. Now I have to wait almost a whole YEAR for the last one to come out?! Come on Sanderson, you can't end a book like that.I honestly don't know how Sanderson does it. With every book of his that I read, I just gain more and more respect for the man. Firefight had a completely different tone than Steelheart, but it worked just as good, if not better. Same main characters, completely different setting. Not a lot of writers can pull that off well, but Sanderson sure as hell can.From amazing world-building, great character development to twists that will blow your socks off. This book had it all. The only thing I wish was different, is more Cody and Abraham (especially Cody, since he was one of my favorite characters in Steelheart). But when I think about it, in the end, I'm glad they were away, safe and sound, and not... you know, dead.And I can't wait to see how will Sanderson wrap the story up in Calamity, because I have no freaking clue where will the story go from here. I just know that it will be epic.
