Firefight starts off with a really rousing manhunt/attempted assassination of a murderous Epic (a person with superpowers who's been corrupted by them), and quickly thereafter David - who is sometimes called "Steelslayer" now; a way cooler name that heâ€™s very proud of - heads off with the Professor, the leader of their rebel group, to what used to be New York City, to try to take care of another major Epic threat. What New York City (now "Babylon Restored" or "Babilar" for short) has evolved into is almost the polar opposite of Chicago, the setting of the first book. Instead of a steel wasteland, we have kind of an urban Venice (a flooded city with tops of skyscrapers poking out) with glowing graffiti and jungle growth inside of what remains of the buildings. David is still a teenage guy who's impetuous and kind of charges around with blinders on, and he still comes up with truly painful similes and metaphors (which are not as funny as the author seems to think they are, at least for me), and it all was just getting kind of old. The middle section of the book also slows down quite a bit, giving me time to think about all the stuff that irked me. So when my 12 year old son absconded with the book a few days ago when I was about 40% in, I thought, whatever, I'll finish it sometime later. Probably.Well, a few days later my kid finished it (5 stars from him, BTW) and I decided I might as well do the same. And I was surprised when the second half of the book kind of reached out and grabbed me by the throat and demanded that I finish it, immediately. There were several surprises and unexpected turns, and I even got some answers to more of those pesky questions that the first book had left me with.So here's the deal: if you didn't care for the first book, there's nothing in here that will really change your mind. If you DID like Steelheart, this is a solid sequel that moves the overall story along nicely. Art credit: Alex Lukas, Flooded City
