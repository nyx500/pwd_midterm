2016 reread over at BB&B in preparation for Calamity is officially DONE.Amazing how many things I forgot - glad I did a reread. And yes, it was fantastic AGAIN.Original review:Brandon Sanderson does it again. I am pretty sure the term "nailed it" is interchangeable with "Sandersoned", for the man is a genius.So this book starts off with your typical "pulls-you-in" Sanderson prologue, moves into the main story running (yep, no crawling or baby steps here), throws in some left and right surprise hooks, and then does the Usain Bolt sprint towards the finish line that the author is known for. And I mean Usain Bolt using grav boots (thank you Pierce Brown) and mech armor (a la All You Need Is Kill) and taking pictures of The Flash as he passes him by. On that note, I doubt that there is anyone better today with finishing a book than Brandon Sanderson. But then I have Sandersonitis. So...dont trust my word for it - read this book and join the cult club.PS: I see a lot of first time Sanderson readers really loving this series. Do yourself a favour/favor and read everything else he's written. If you're not sure where to start, pick up The Final Empire. Its the first of a trilogy and was my own introduction to the author and his incomparable imagination. And if that series blows your mind, then pick up The Way of Kings. You're welcome.
