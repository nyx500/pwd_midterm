For info, I'm usually a very mild mannered person who wouldn't dream of writing a negative review but after more than a year since reading the final Fitz and the Fool book I'm still hurt, angry and upset at the harsh and ham fisted way the final book was written. One would almost think Hobb had no love at all for Fitz and the Fool and their ending, it was almost like somebody else had written the final books, someone with little knowledge of the previous books, the characters and their struggles. But hey, that's just my opinion and after looking at the reviews I'm in the minority. All I can say is that I still feel deeply hurt at the way the final book dealt with our beloved characters and I've spent years of my life reading about them.
