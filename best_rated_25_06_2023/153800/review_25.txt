Ugh I love these characters so damn much. But like this book kinda killed me a little,  WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SINK MY SHIP TAMORA!?! WHYY!. I think I liked the ending of Squire more than this one, I was happier with that one hahaha. I loved seeing Kell in this as a Commander in the war efforts rather than just as a lady knight. She still gets her hero moments, but I loved seeing a woman in charge of so many people, gives me hope. I think the struggle between Kell wanting to stay and lead at Haven was contrasted really nicely with her desire to run off to Scamron and rid the world of the evil Blayce. Also,Kell knows how to shut down the haters.
