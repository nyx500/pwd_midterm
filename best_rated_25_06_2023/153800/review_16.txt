Reasonable finish to the series. Not quite the "perfect" ending that Pierce usually delivers for her heroines, but perhaps slightly more realistic. The final test also seemed unreal (more like a confusing dream sequence), and the neat pairing-off of the side characters, while Kel seems to have walked away empty-handed, was a bit anti-climatic. That's nit-picking, though, but that aside, the one thing that truly annoyed me was the extent to which Kel seems to have won everyone's hearts and magically transformed the society from fearful and dismissing of a "woman trying to do a man's job" to one that largely approved of and even depended on her existence and skills. A surprising and rather unbelievable change; there is no way people around her can change so quickly, even if she's managed to impress them. Squire and Lady Knight were unfortunately a far cry from the awesome first two books.
