I was just the tiniest bit disappointed by this book. I really loved it, but not quite as much as Squire and not enough to be a full five stars. It's only a little longer than book three, but it felt so much longer while reading it. The ending was exciting and there were numerous exciting things that took place during the book, but the first two thirds dragged a bit for me. I was still interested, but it took a concerted effort to keep picking this book up. I didn't fly through it the way I did the first three books.There wasn't a pacing issue in this one since it wasn't taking place over a specific period of time. The events just happened as they happened, no need to skip long months of time. It takes place over the course of less than a year, making it the shortest time period of any book in the series. I think that helped the pacing, but it did make the book drag just a little.Beyond that, my thoughts are the same as for the first three. I love Kel's character. The feminism is great. It's a fantastic ending. I absolutely recommend this series. You don't technically need to read Alanna or the Immortals first, but I would recommend at least picking up Alanna. I think it explains a lot about the world and helps with appreciating the books overall.
