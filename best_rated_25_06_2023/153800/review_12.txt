Sadly this book is not my favorite of the series. But it deserves an extra half a star or so since the series in general is strong.I love Kel and her compassion for the 'small'. I love her nickname 'Protector of the Small'. I always am incensed when I read about the No Name Man and Stennum. I can't believe that so many people are willing to condone the deaths of children to win a war! -.-I find the amount of war a bit tedious in this volume. I don't mind the fighting but it's just got a bit repetitive. :/I'm sad that Cleon and Kel didn't work out. I really hope that Dom and Kel end up together. I think they make a cute couple. ^-^I'm glad that Wyldon didn't have to send Kel to traitor's hill. He has really grown since the first book.
