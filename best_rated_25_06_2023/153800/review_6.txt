It's been a very Tamora Pierce week. I reread all the Kel books, two of the Alanna books, and now I'm filling in the gaps between post-earthquake Tortall and Kel's Tortall with the first Daine book. Anyway, I don't have a lot to say about this. I first read it years ago, and it was never my favorite Kel book. There are really great moments, like when Raoul gets angry at Wyldon - little character asides that rise to the heights of previous books - but mostly this is a book where Kel is beloved by everyone worthwhile, and she almost single-handedly wins the war. She's too perfect here. It's frustrating. I love this world, I really do. And I love how Pierce paints with strokes just fine enough to suggest an entire world of detail outside her descriptions, because that gives Tortall a richness beyond what she actually depicts. But her strength lies in plots where characters are challenged, and Kel isn't challenged much here. The Numair series has a release date now, and I have to say I'm nervous about it. Pierce hasn't done all that well with fill-in-the-blanks books until now (see: Melting Stones) and I don't want past books as much as future ones. That's so much more compelling: what does happen next in this constantly-changing realm?
