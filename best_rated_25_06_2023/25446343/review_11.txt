3.5 Stars“It’s the mind. It’s the most complex and astonishing thing there is, that there’s a world inside each of us that no one else can ever know or see or visit.”BEFORE y’all judge me for giving Queen Taylor anything less than 4 stars, please remember I am cynical and dead inside, thank you. Okay, but for real. Laini Taylor’s writing is decadent, tightly-crafted and flawless. And if I was just rating this book for her ability to stream words together into sentences so beautiful they make my soul cry… she gets all the stars. “Once upon a time there was a silence that dreamed of becoming a song, and then I found you, and now everything is music.”“There comes a certain point with a hope or a dream, when you either give it up or give up everything else. And if you choose the dream, if you keep on going, then you can never quit, because it's all you are.”(I mean CMON. Just look at that)But that’s not all a book is. I’m not saying this book is bad. Because there are still some great things-- and I’m still in love with all the characters. This entire cast is precious and you root for literally everyone. Lazlo is still a dweeb, but he’s my dweep. Minya is still morally-challenged, but you feel for her and her expanding backstory. Ruby is underrated. Sarai’s arc didn’t make sense but she’s adorable and I love her. AND I would just like the record to state that I recognized Thyon’s potential back when the first book came out and y’all all hated him. But he totally reaches it here in an unexpected side-plot that I loved. So you owe me and him a formal apology, please and thank you. BUTWhyyyy does everything have to be about saving the world and preventing complete and total apocalypse??? The stakes were simply too high. The first book had already worked to establish these characters and plenty of conflict, I just don’t understand why the ante had to be raised to an unbelievable point. Why was there SO much romance?? Look, I love the characters, I love their chemistry, and I genuinely love the romance. I just don’t want to read a make-out scene and blissed out happiness every other chapter for an entire book. It was repetitive I’m sorry. I just think some of those scenes would have held more impact they’d trimmed the fat a little bit. In Conclusion:I’m sure I had more thoughts but it’s been a year, y’all. This book doesn’t quite live up to the first. Problems are solved too easily (without real pay-out other than some repetitive scenes) and then the stakes are raised dramatically again. But these characters are some of my favorite, Taylor’s writing is astounding and it’s definitely not bad.——-Buddy Read with the fantabulous Mary! ✨💕
