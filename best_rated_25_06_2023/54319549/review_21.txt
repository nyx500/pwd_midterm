ðŸŽ§ 2nd Read, Nov. 2021 â€” 4 StarsðŸ“š 1st Read, Sept. 2020 â€” 3.5 Stars#1 From Blood and Ash â€” 4 StarsIdk if someoneâ€™s mentioned it or if Iâ€™m alone in this, but AKOFAF felt like the mix between Twilight and ACOMAF with a little bit of Wonder Woman cause for some reason Atlantia and the army of female warriors made me think of Themyscira. Iâ€™m not alluding to any similarities in plot or romance specifically, but this book certainly got the vibes.I felt pretty much the same as I did the 1st book, but can we talk about the ending?! Because that was EARTH SHATTERING. Iâ€™m honestly not sure what that last revelation means. ðŸ™ˆ Listen, I had a hard time as it is keeping up with all the history lessons, all the different species of vampires and werewolves.Thereâ€™s so much to swallow about this world that sometimes my small brain just couldnâ€™t compute, and I didnâ€™t care enough to try harder because all I focused on was the romanceâ€”which I shouldnâ€™t be failed to mention was WHOLESOME (even though I got kinda tired of all the repeated Poppy jokes and teasings about her inquisitive and violent nature).So, basically my review of the 1st book pretty much still applies to this one. I only enjoyed it slightly more because I loved the focus of the story in this installment. The world building was better explained, but there was a lot to process, and Iâ€™m confused. I may have to re-read the two books, but Iâ€™m excited to see what Poppy has in store for us in the next one.
