“You’re a strange person.”“I prefer the term fabulously weird.”4.5. I have to admit that I started this series already ready to rage about how it wasn’t as good as Percy Jackson because the Percy Jackson series is one that I hold particularly close to my heart. However, if after the first book I was positively surprised but not impressed, the rest of the series just got better and better and I can almost say I find this just as good as the other series. This series stands out in how diverse and open-minded it is. How many books have you read that figures characters with different religious beliefs (without any of them being judged for it, or only seen through it), characters with disabilities (and I mean important characters), characters that are gender fluid and characters with different sexualities, and more ? A book that does not make those things the most important thing about these characters. Because what is important is how kind, brave, funny, sassy, and heroic they are. THANK YOU. It felt amazing. I love all of those characters and I would do anything to protect them. Alex, Sam and Hearthstone especially. Concerning the story, like any Rick Riordan’s book it was funny, full of action, taught a lot about North mythology and was overall such an easy and light read. I don’t think I have anything bad to say about this really. I’m really sad that this series is finished because I think I could have read a lot more books about these characters. Guys, if you loved Percy Jackson or if you’re looking for diversity and something different, I can only HIGHLY recommend this.
