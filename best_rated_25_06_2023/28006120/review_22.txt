Like all the books in this series, I really liked this. I think the best part of the series are the characters. I loved how his friends from the 19th floor had a bigger role in this book and had more character development. All of his friends are just so precious. I love them and want to protect each and every one of them. Overall, this was a fantastic installment in the Magnus Chase series.P.S. Alex is still my fav <3
