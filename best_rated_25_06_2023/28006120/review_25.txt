✨ 🌟 5  'fabulously weird'  stars 🌟 ✨    Sometimes you lie to deceive people. Sometimes you lie because you need the lie to become the truth.    # 1 The Sword of Summer - 4.25 🌟# 2 The Hammer of Thor - 4 🌟# 3 The Ship of the Dead - 5 🌟Ragnarok is almost here, and our heroes must find a way to stop it. This was hands down my favourite book of the series!   “I figured something out. You can't hold onto hate forever. It won't do a thing to the person you hate, but it'll poison you, sure enough.”   The final part of the trilogy was *everything* I wanted ❤️   “I think the hardest thing we can ever do is see someone for who they really are. Our parents. Our friends. Ourselves.”   Magnus is my favourite Rick Riordan character yet. He is funny, brave, sweet, loyal and there is so much goodness in him that I can't put into words. Several times in this book I wanted to reach out and give him a hug.I loved how Magnus wasn't really the best fighter, or wasn't the son of a really famous Norse God. Instead  his strength lies in healing people, not just their bodies, but their souls too.  I would much rather prefer someone who heals and inspires people, than one who is simply good with a sword! I absolutely adored how the relationship between Magnus and Alex unfolded, and my guess of Magnus being a pansexual is finally confirmed!   I'll be honest. A small part of my brain thought,  Alex is male right now. I have just been kissed by a dude. How do I feel about that? The rest of my brain answered:  I have just been kissed by Alex Fierro. I am absolutely great with that.   Gah! Those two deserve all the happiness in the world.In this book we finally get the stories of the other side characters including Mallory, Gunderson and TJ. The only one I missed here was Otis the goat! 😂 I'm going to miss this whole squad so much and I really wish there were more books to this series! I rarely rate books a solid 5-star, but this one deserves it. Even though it has a happy ending, it is kind of bittersweet.   “The world will end. The big picture cannot be changed. But in the meantime, as Loki once said, we can choose to alter the details. That’s how we take control of our destiny.”   __________________________ Pre-reading: It's finally time to read the last book! ✨I had been putting this off because I'm  not  ready to say goodbye to my babies 🙈💜😢
