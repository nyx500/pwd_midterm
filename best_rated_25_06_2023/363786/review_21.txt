I am completely in love with this series. It makes me laugh, cry, and rage. I am crying right now from both happiness and heartache. Don't judge me until you read until the last page because this story is BRUTAL on your emotions. Good lord. Anne Bishop I bow down to you as my queen.Daemon, I love you so very much. I find peoples' lack of faith in you astounding, but I have always believed in you!
