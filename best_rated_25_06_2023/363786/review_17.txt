I only skimmed through the first three books in this series, just to get a sense of what the story was supposed to be about. My verdict is that this book, and I use the term very very loosely, is the result of an agitated, feverish mind who simply had to try their best to come up with something, anything, and forced together every bit and scrap of ideas and information they could think of -which in their aforementioned agitated state obviously wasn’t much- and pushed out the contents therewith. The world building is reminiscent of very shoddily made, third rate vampire movies, the names made me cringe, the customs and interactions and dynamics of the plot were nauseating, and.... I could happily abuse and insult every aspect of the very little I read from these books. But I shan’t bore you. Spare yourselves and don’t waste your time or money.
