Wonderfully immersive. Love the expansion into international politics and all the plot threads Lee keeps weaving until the very end. An ending which had me screaming "She did not do that!" multiple times at my poor husband who was just trying to sleep...it might have been 2am. This is incredible world building and character development while maintaining high stakes and complex plotting. If mafia families, magic, and politics are your cup of tea, I don't think it gets any better than this.
