A fantastic follow up to the extremely impressive Jade City. Jade War keeps to the same standard of excellence set by its predecessor with complicated yet precise storytelling, deep worldbuilding, and fully realised characters. There were moments of shock and surprise, and given what Lee showed she was willing to do in Jade City, many turns in the story where I really wasn't sure what the outcome would be.Yet again Lee shows that she is a writer to be reckoned with; one who improves upon her previous accomplishments with each successive book. I have no doubt that the final book in the Green Bone Saga, Jade Legacy, will be a masterful conclusion.
