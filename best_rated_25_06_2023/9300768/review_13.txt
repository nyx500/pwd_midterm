Wow.This one has been on my To-Be-Read pile for a long time. In an effort to clean out some of my older books I finally got around to reading it.And now I'm not sure what took me so long! Heroes is a gritty book about a war between the Northmen and the Union, which takes place around a hill called the Heroes.It's a dark book, with rough characters and some pretty gorey deaths. Ambercrombie does a great job with his battle scenes, showing the confusion of war and the costs of being a hero.But with a war comes a lot of downtime. But scenes without fighting are boring right? Wrong! Some of the best quotes came out of the downtime, and many times I found myself laughing out loud.The fool's tasks lined up in crushingly tedious procession. Run. Practice. Shit a turd. Write a letter. Eat. Watch. Write a turd. Shit a letter. Eat. Bed.Or nodding in agreement to some sound advice:An unarmed man is like an unroofed house. They'll both end up leaking.Through this great story however I found a deeper meaning. The book is divided into 5 parts:1. Before the War2. Day One3. Day Two4. Day Three5. After The WarOn coming to after the war I found myself stumbling on lines I had already read in before the war. Was this laziness on the authors part? Or was he saying this is just an endless cycle. Is before and after the war the same thing as after one war at some point becomes before another war?And its books where I continue to think on them after I've put them down that show a talented writer. Mr. Abercrombie you have a new fan.Everyone needs to read this book.
