I now have a YouTube channel that I run with my brother, called 'The Brothers Gwynne'. Check it out - The Brothers GwynneWow, I loved this book. I thought it would be nigh impossible to equal or surpass the enjoyment I received from Red Sister, I was wrong, very wrong.Grey Sister continues all the great aspects of the former book with an intriguing plot, diverse characters and a vivid world, then added a lot more consisting of larger conflicts and countless more twists.The prose was once again wonderful from Mark Lawrence with a poetic edge that guided me from page to page which had me marvelling at how long I had been reading with absolute concentration on the story.The plot developed at an appropriate rate with tension consistently rising throughout and then hitting a peak which was well worth the wait as grand events coincided and the consequences of actions rose dramatically. The twists that were revealed completely shocked me and directed the book into an unguessable future which made the experience even more exciting.The characters were once again amazing with their variety of personalities which allowed me to despise and love them and to feel their successes and failures. There were a few heart wrenching moments which truly reveal how the characters have come to matter to me.The ending was fabulous as it produced even more adversaries for the protagonists to face in the last instalment in which I hope they deliver a large dose of deserved vengeance.Grey Sister is a definite five star rating just as its predecessor was and I am going to dive straight into the finale of the series, Holy Sister, which I am incredibly pleased to say has just been released, meaning I will not have to spend an agonising period of time waiting. I am confident that it will be a brilliant ending overflowing with memorable moments which will bring the story to an impressive close.My full review of Grey Sister is on BookNest now!
