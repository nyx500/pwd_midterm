I've never done one of those "book reveal" that seems so popular these days, so I thought I'd make an attempt at it for this one.Did I do it right?I figure since this book is like, all Harry Potter-ish, with an orphan girl learning about her magical talents, encountering rivals and making lifelong friendships along the way, my bunnies would make the perfect representative for this book. It's such a happy, cheerful, heartwarming book. Rainbows and bunnies and unicorns all the way^_________^“Before you die I’ll take your fingers, one by one, and then your eyes.” He stood and at the last moment pulled his knife up through her nose. The sudden burning pain made her cry out. Hot blood spilled across her face, the taste of it filling her mouth.I'M JUST KIDDING, GUYS. Do NOT get this book for your Harry-Potter loving kids unless you want to pay for a lifetime of therapy. It's bloody, there's torture and evil and murder and blood. Not recommended for kids.Weeeeeeell....little Khanh would have loved it, but that's little Khanh. Normal children would be traumatized. So don't. Just don't. For those mature enough for it, though, it is a wonderful book. There's failure, resilience, friendship, and a fascinatingly built-world. And enough evil to make me salivate.The rocks around her began to bleed. An awful rasping breath shuddered through the blackness. And out there a howling hate, condensing. A darker clot of night. The stench of decay surrounded her. Screams of pain worse than the abbess had made when they’d burned her.Love it. Can't wait for the third.
