I'm just going to get hooked by this book BRB__________________________________________4.45/5 ⭐“Scars are not shameful, not unless you let them be (…). If you do not wear them, they will wear you.”Well, of course, this book has at the very beginning something the second one lacked almost in all of its length – action that makes me go up the wall.Okay, I don’t say that A Gathering of Shadows did not have action at all, because it did, but it wasn’t as packed and as accurate to the actual course of the story as it was in A Darker Shade of Magic and in this one.With that beginning, there was no doubt in my mind that A Conjuring of Light was going to be waaay messier than I initially thought (before actually picking it up). And you know what? I was right.Messy as hell. 10/10 for the mess, good job with that Ms Schwab!First things first, even though I really liked this (it gave me a three-course anxiety meal and all that)  I still felt like I couldn’t give it 5 full stars because it was a bit too long for how they handled the whole situation at the end.It wasn’t bad at all, but it did leave me with a bit of a bitter taste just at the end (and as I type this I am literally wrinkling my nose remembering the feeling). I wanted either less amount of plot or a more complex solution to the problem. But oh well, we can’t have it all I guess.Now, I know that I started off by telling you things I did not like about this book and I generally don’t do that but I really had to give a little fair warning at the beginning, just in case someone’s getting bored with me and my silly little words, you know, waiting for me to get to the point.And if you thought the things I didn’t like about this are over, think again :DThere is more to come. But later.Now let’s talk about things I did like. Because – you guessed it by my rating – I did like thing in this too.For me, Schwab’s writing style is always something I look forward to reading. I always love the way she tells a story. I love the way she is building up her worlds. I love the way she is inserting a little bit of evil in all of her characters.You simply cannot trust any of V.E. Schwab’s characters.And that seems to be a rule. But that’s not bad, because the world in which they find themselves is always some kind of general chaos or evil.“Life is chaos. Time is order.”Even so, I did love the characters, because even though they are so not trustworthy, they still have something good in them and I dare say, some of them are quite lovely actually. Alucard, for example, is one character that I truly loved and I enjoyed reading about and his and Rhy’s interactions made me so giggly happy you haven’t a clue.Also, I started liking some characters I didn’t really think I would, at least not from the beginning. And that’s always something that gets me by surprise in a very warm way (which hey, it's a good thing!).However, I did hate the fact that I had to struggle with some of the characters’ stubbornness. And here I will definitely include Kell, Rhy and, the queen of stubbornness herself, Lila Bard.Why do they feel the need to rebel against a piece of advice? Why not find smart solutions to what is actually bothering them? Why simply go absolutely rogue and create three problems while trying to solve a tiny one?No clue, I swear. But I wanted to bang their heads into a wall at some point in the book.This book felt a bit like anarchy, to be completely honest. I mean, it did pump some serious amount of adrenaline in my veins at some point and that wasn’t really a bad thing. It was so well written and the characters – annoyingly stubborn as they were – actually made sense to the whole action. The story unravelled nicely and the only thing I wished from it was to not be, I don’t know, so rushed at the end. To make them last a bit longer.That ending really felt like everyone has struggled and suffered so much for so little. Hello?? The solution was RIGHT THERE IN YOUR FACES.That easy. Ugh.I did enjoy this book. And I do recommend the whole trilogy, it’s absolutely fantastic, wildly imaginative and different from other books of the same genre. A uniqueness signed V.E. Schwab.“They ran together with the river and the mist and the moonless sky until they were everywhere.”
