WELL.This was an intense read, and I LOVED every moment of it (even when I was crying and in pain). A magnificent book and conclusion to a series. These characters have stolen my heart and run off with it. I don't mind, though.Thanks Red & Kassie for buddy reading with me and making this reading experience so magical <3
