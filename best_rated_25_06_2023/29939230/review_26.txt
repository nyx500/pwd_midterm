Anoshe was a word for strangers in the street, and lovers between meetings, for parents and children, friends and family. It softened the blow of leaving. Eased the strain of parting. A careful nod to the certainty of today, the mystery of tomorrow. When a friend left, with little chance of seeing home, they said anoshe. When a loved one was dying, they said anoshe. When corpses were burned, bodies given back to the earth and souls to the stream, those left grieving said anoshe. Anoshe brought solace. And hope. And the strength to let go.me: *slams fist on table* time to write acol reviewinner me: you can't write a serious one even if they paid youinner me: you're going to babble and yell incoherentlyinner me: it would be full of cringeinner me: and you will also cryme: *slams two fists on table* THATS THE PLANI HONESTLY DONT KNOW WHERE TO START. SO MANY FEELINGS.acol is a beautiful conclusion of one of my most favorite book series and i spent 10 minutes crying because it's over. i can't easily let my favorite characters and one of my favorite worlds go.i pulled an allnighter to read this book, i binge read it for 11 hours, had like 2 hours of sleep in two days, paced around my flat like a fucking zombie numb and empty after i finished it and I REGRET NOTHING. i loved this book so much!!! it's so intense, action-packed and glorious. i enjoyed the story and all characters interactions and i WISH it would've been longer (even tho its 600+ pages lmao)this book made me cry so fucking much though. like, i don't cry easily and GODDAMN IT VICTORIA 	why. acol made me feel so many things, it made me laugh, made me cry, made me so worried sometimes, i felt like dying. sometimes it was SO FUCKING CREEPY and sometimes it was so FLUFFY. also JEEZ there was no relaxing, something good happens and you're like 'oh phew' and then you turn the page AND SHIT HITS YOU IN THE FACE. pls give me a break????i'm very sad that the story has ended but at the same time im very happy.A Conjuring of Light may mark the end of one adventure, but remember: when it comes to this world, new doors are always being made.- Victoria Schwab!!!!!!!!!!everything further contains spoilers which i won't mark as spoilers so PLEASE don't read it further if you haven't read the book yet!!!!!!!!!!listen, i expected it to be cool, but it was way cooler??? but what's with this KILLING SPREE. remember when victoria was like oh this book is 35% death and i was like phew it doesnt sound so bad AND THEN THIS BOOK MURDERED LIKE EVERY SIDE CHARACTER I CARED ABOUT AND I WAS LIKE WHAT THE FUCK VICTORIA. i cried the hardest at calla's death, maxim's death, hastra's death (omg i cant even think abt it without tearing up??? he thought he was a bad guard and then he saved kell and,,,,send help why did my tiny son die he should've been a priest but then kell might've died WHY) AND HOLLAND'S DEATH (i knew holland would die and i knew he would die like he did (finally free and calm but JESUS. FUCKING. CHRIST. i didn't know i have so many tears in me).“Death comes for us all,” said Holland evenly. “I would simply have mine mean something.”about holland though. for me he was the highlight of this book. i didn't like him in the first book and then agos happened and i softened to him BUT IN THIS FUCKING BOOK HE JUST BROKE MY HEART SO MANY TIMES MY SOFT SPOT FOR HIM IS THE SIZE OF OUR UNIVERSE. he got a redemption arc and this redemption arc is 9138483/10, his backstory made me cry so many times (like, his brother tried to kill him when he was a little boy???? a girl he loved and was happy with tried to kill him?? his best friend was killed and he couldn't save him??? he was tortured and captured and he couldn't do anything about it but just count his kills (i will never stop crying that he did it) and suffer??? and then it happened again after he just got free??? my poor tortured soN, i wanted to tuck him in the bed and cover him with all the blankets i have). i loved his interaction with kell so much and i loved holland so much and i can't convey my emotions about him in the text because DAMMIT he's totally the best character of this book and one of the best antagonists-but-not-really i've ever read about and can i have more characters like holland pretty please. i fucking started bawling when he trapped osaron and then i kept sobbing when he woke up and i couldn't stop weeping when he died because i knew it would happen and in a way it was a perfect ending for him (he died and his world lived and that is what he always desired and awknfaliefn im dead) but DAMN IT HURTS.Lila met Holland’s gaze, expecting—maybe even hoping—to find that cold, implacable calm, perhaps tinged with disgust. Instead, she found shades of sadness, loss. And somehow, strength. The strength to go on. To try again. To trust.i loved INTERACTIONS in this book so much.kell and rhy are forever my most favorite brother duo. they love and care about each other so much i would die for them.rhy and alucard are two idiots in love and i hope they're forever happy. alucard's backstory is so horrible (i cant believe his brother survived but good people didnt wtf can he jump off a cliff thank u very much nobody needs him) and i'm so happy that rhy understood and forgave him and wjskfeafjsklfskl pls be happy.kell and lila (!!!!!!!!!!!!!). i shipped them from the very beginning AND THEY FINALLY GOT TOGETHER AND THEY'RE SOOO CUUUUTEEE. i love kell and lila and their relationship and the fact that kell would rather shoot himsef in the head than trust her (jk). i love how they're different but they complete each other in their own way. i love that the series wasn't really focused on their romance, but it's still enough and it's beautiful and i want to cri. also kell is very efficient teacher isnt he.Ned stared at her with open awe. “You’re like him.”“No,”said Kell dryly, striding past him. “She’s one of a kind.”kell and alucard gave me life with their bickering.kell and holland!!!!!!!!!!! good shit right here!!!!!!!!!! kell cared about holland and i cried at this and i wish it was different between them, like, holland is so older brother material for kell and AAAAAAAAAAAAA. and holland, too, was pretty fond of kell here i think. and i want to weep again because it could've been so much more.ALSO THE SQUAD aka kell, rhy, lila and alucard. omg how much i loved that scene when they drank together and their interactions overall AND I WISH THERE WERE MORE because damn this is the squad i can read hours about.THE THREE ANTARI. one of the best things that happened in this book. i wanted this from the very beginning and YESSSS kell, lila and holland finally worked together AND HOLLAND WAS THE ANCHOR, THE CENTER and this is perfect??? Lila looked to Kell. “You didn’t teach me this one.”His jaw was slack. “I …I didn’t know it.”Holland gave them both a bland look. “Amazing,”he said dryly. “There are still things you haven’t learned.”i loved all characters in this book, and thanks to victoria schwab for creating them and i cant believe i have to say good bye to them.*cries externally**cries internally**cries eternally*as i already said im pretty satisfied with the closure. but i'm not satisfied with complete lack of backstory for lila. like, kell's parents thing was at least acknowledged, holland got a decent backstory that i will never stop crying about, but lila got nothing. i wanted to know more about her from the very beginning of the series and we didn't even get glimpses into her past. (i also don't understand how she almost died when kell said 93289894 times in adsom that antari are almost invincible and it's really hard, almost impossible to kill them and then bam lila could've died if holland didn't heal her. i understand that her wound was fatal but idk). pretty much only issues i have with this book tho.overall, for me this book was perfect. fast, intense and exciting. i wish it weren't the end.pls hold me while im crying12108392810293/10 It wasn’t a good-bye, not really. What was the word for parting? Anoshe.That was it.
