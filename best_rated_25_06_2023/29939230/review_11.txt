why on earth am i so emotional right now!?!?! its been awhile since a conclusion to a series has hit me so hard. goodness, my heart is full. i loved that this picked up immediately where ‘a gathering of shadows’ left off. it was such a quick dive straight into the conclusion and this final book really has the best qualities of the previous two - more marvellous world building is at play as the characters travel beyond the city of london, and touching backstories/flashbacks are present to give even more depth and development to those characters with whom i have bonded. but where this book found its own voice was in its plot. this was filled with so much more action and adventure that wasnt quite as prevalent previously. so much was at stake that i couldnt put this down - i became so invested in the captivating writing, the constant peril and intrigue, and the emotions i felt for the characters and their redemption. just everything about this pulled me in and wouldnt let go. and even though this book hit every mark all the way through, it was really the ending that shined for me. this was wrapped up so nicely and provided the closure i needed after pouring my heart and soul into this story across three books. i felt very at peace with the way the story was resolved, which is all i could have asked for. and so to this series i tenderly and lovingly say, anoshe - until another day.↠ 4.5 stars
