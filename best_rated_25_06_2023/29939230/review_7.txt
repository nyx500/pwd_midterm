Reread January 2020: sometimes you reread a story, and you realize youâ€™ve forgotten how absolutely fucking incredible it is. This is one of those times. If A Gathering of Shadows deserved 100+ stars, A Conjuring of Light deserves 10x that many. I have no words. This series is honestly my favorite out of everything I've ever read and I just want to reread the first one now that it's all over! My heart is so happy. Anoshe ADSOM.
