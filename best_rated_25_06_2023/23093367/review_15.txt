You know, I really cant get over how good this series is. I took maybe a month between reading the first 3 and then this one, and I was so excited to get back into the story. It's simultaneously adorable, creepy, sleazy, and incredible. Each chapter leaves me wanting so much more, and yet is so fulfilling. If you want to know more about what I think of the series, check out my other reviews. Otherwise, I can't recommend this enough. WEBSITE | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM
