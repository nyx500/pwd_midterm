3.5/5 StarsBuddy reading this entire series with my favorite Princess CelesteTook me a while but NOW THIS IS GETTING BETTER! Finally! Imo Volume 4 of Saga is the best so far. It's fast paced, the stories are great (it's finally going somewhere), it's more complex and the drawings and characters development improve much further. If the quality of this volume continue to the rest of the series, I can see why Saga received the acclaim it gets.Marko, Hazel, Alana have changing and more complex relationship now. However, the best characters goes to Prince Robot IV and The Robot Janitor, without those two I really don't see the plot going anywhere great. Especially The Robot Janitor, his appearance really make the story much more intriguing.I read the entire volume straight within 40 minutes cause it was so addictive. Hopefully this goes the same way for the rest of the series!
