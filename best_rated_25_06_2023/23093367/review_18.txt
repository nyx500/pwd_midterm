First off, I wanted to kill this stupid chic thing. I don't even know her name. I looked all over and thought I was losing my mind not remembering her name. All I can say is she's blue, she tries going after Marko and lets just say that little Hazel said it best in the book Her is ugly I had to get that out so now we can move on :-D Oh yeah, her name is Ginny! Who cares! So it starts out with Prince tv heads wife has a son while he is off in the twilight zone. <---Read book 3. Said baby gets stolen by another tv head for a certain cray cray reason. Well, maybe it's not too crazy. I mean he had a point about his kids, but I digress. Meanwhile, Marko, Alana, Hazel, Klara and Izabel are all hiding out. Well mostly Alana, Marko and Hazel since they go out in public. Alana is a cool star in a tv show and gets to play dress up and beat up bad guys and stuff. And her and Marko are having some issues. But they make up when it comes to Hazel and I think they are still in love, just tough times with all that going on right? Marko puts on some disguise that's not really a disguise to me, but whatever works :-DThe prince tv head gets some of his senses back and is told about his son being stolen so he's on a mission. While said person that stole his son is out on his mission and killing people, er, things left and right. Oh yeah and I forgot to mention that Hazel has a new pet named Friendo :-) Anyhoo, some stuff happens I can't tell you about and the ending is super awesome! Some of the other peeps from the books are in it for a little bit and some new people. And I leave you with the above crazy image. I'm not going to tell you what was going on in this picture but it's probably not what your thinking. lol MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List
