This fourth installment was not as perfect as the last one, but it was still fucking amazing.The plot continues to thicken and the characters keep getting better at what they do. While this one started off slow, the pacing improved while nearing the middle. A lot of unexpected things happened plus an annoying cliffhanger in the end. I can't wait to read the next volume to know what's going to happen with  Marko and Alana's relationship.. Add the fact that while Hazel continues to grow up, she also continues to be a lot more interesting. Vaughan sure knows how to write a great plot.The artwork is consistent since the first volume. Vivid colors and interesting cartoon take on the characters. Not my favorite artwork ever but still really good. My favorite thing of this volume would be the fact that The Stalk and Will appeared in the end. The Stalk and Will are among my favorite characters in Saga. While they don't seem to play a huge role in the plot anymore, I still like reading about them from time to time.4/5 stars. While this will never compare to the amazing volumes 2 and 3, it was still amazing in its own way. Go ahead and read the series if you haven't even tried by now.
