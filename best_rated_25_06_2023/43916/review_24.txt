I first read this book as a teenager, sometime around 1990. At the time my friends and I considered Magician to be the pinnacle of the Fantasy genre, and I still see it discussed with the same reverence today.A few years back I reread Magician with very high expectations, but found it a fairly bland read. Neither the story or its characters gripped me, and the narrative structure seemed somewhat clumsy.I finished reading Magician, but didn't rush out to buy the other books in the Riftwar saga.At 15 years old I would have given this book 5 stars, but at 36 years of age I only consider it to be an "above average" read. For my money authors like George R. R. Martin leave Magician in their dust.Update July 2019:I recently read Magican for the third time and enjoyed the book a lot more this time around. Perhaps I went in with lower expectations, or maybe I was just in the mood for some classic sword and sorcery. Either way, Magician scratched my high fantasy itch, and I am glad I gave it another chance.In my original review I compared Magician unfavourably with the work of George R. R. Martin. Interestingly, while rereading Magician I noticed several similarities with Martin’s A Game of Thrones, notably the Tsurani political power struggles which Feist called the “Game of the Council”. Perhaps “Game of ...” is a common turn of phrase in fantasy novels, but it makes me wonder if perhaps Feist was an influence on Martin. Food for thought!
