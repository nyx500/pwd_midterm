Magician was my favourite epic fantasy book for over two decades, and the one I've reread the most until The Way of Kings came along. The last time I've read this book (for the third time) was when I first got my Kindle Paperwhite and then proceeded to finish The Riftwar Cycle (except for the books non-essential to the main storyline). That was a good eight years ago, and I wondered whether it would still hold up well after I've read so much modern fantasy since. I'm pleased to discover that it did. In fact, all my favourite scenes or moments from the book were just as good as I remembered them to be. Of all the classic, tropish fantasy written in the 80s that I've read, the writing in Riftwar was possibly stylistically closest to modern fantasy's third person limited perspective. This may likely have been the reason it became my favourite as I felt most invested in the characters of this series. I'll forever have a soft spot for Pug and Tomas, whose development started off in a most wholesome manner in Magician: Apprentice, and really took off in Magician: Master. I personally thought that it was a good decision in part of Feist to release both Apprentice and Master in a single volume, as the combined format served the story of Pug and Tomas much better. And sure enough, I found myself completely engaged and not wanting to put down the book as I reached the second half even though this was my fourth time reading it. When I came to the end I knew that I'm now in trouble, for my desire to reread the entire Riftwar Cycle, as well as those books which I've skipped the first time has once again come to the fore. Admittedly, the quality of this read would realistically warrant a 4 or 4.5-star rating now. But call me a sentimental fool for I'm keeping this book firmly in my favourite shelf, and retaining its 5-star rating for feel-good nostalgic reasons.
