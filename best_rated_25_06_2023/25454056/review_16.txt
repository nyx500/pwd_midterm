I don't know why I raised my expectations on this, I probably shouldn't have. But this this is the most sexist filth I have ever read. The book feels like one big male fantasy, defining female characters only by their look and boobs and romanticising assault. A female character is only introduced is she poses an opportunity for Geralt as someone to fuck. Even the "powerful" female character Yennefer (whom I loved in the games) is treated like shit. I find it disturbing how her main motivation as a character is to regain the ability to have children. This was already uncomfortable from the beginning but then you get lines like this (talking about losing her fertility): "I paid with everything I had... Nothing remained." Because if a woman is no longer able to have kids she is basically worthless right?
