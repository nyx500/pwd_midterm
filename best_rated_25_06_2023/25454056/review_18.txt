Inconsistent quality of stories and Geralt is nowhere near as good of a broody badass as he was in The Last Wish. The kiss of death that brought it down to 2-stars was the extreme objectification of women.Every woman we meet is described based on her beauty, lack thereof, or her breasts and shapely legs. Got old with the very first one. And he was quite uncharitable in his descriptions. One would have been beautiful if she would keep her mouth closed. Another onehad gorgeous, utterly perfect breasts. Only the colour spoiled the effect; the nipples were dark green and the aureolas around them were only a little lighter.It was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the story, plus alienates female readers by being obviously written with only a male audience in mind. I did enjoy the last two stories: 'Sword of Destiny' and 'Something More'.I absolutely couldn't stand 'A Shard of Ice' where Geralt acts like a lovesick teenager fighting over Yennefer with Istredd, also acting like a douche, and Yennefer is portrayed as the hyperdesirable megaslut. The whole thing was out of character, pointless and pathetic.If you're out to read the whole series I'd still recommend it but beware.
