“The only thing that everyone is destined for is death. Death is the other blade of the two-edged sword. I am the first blade. And the second is death, why he dogs my footsteps.”Unpopular opinion: the show is better than the books.Show Yennefer is my favorite character. A friend of mine complained that she's too greedy and entitled and is never satisfied however much power she gains. I view her as ambitious and that can turn people off because she is absolutely unapologetic about it. She's an unlikable heroine, but relatable—or at least to me—because we know her backstory and understand her. Book Yennefer is plain unlikable. We only see her through Geralt's perspective, so she gives off a Pixie Girl vibe. She is gorgeous, powerful, and unattainable. The same characteristics that empower Show Yennefer make Book Yennefer unsympathetic because we never see her side.The book seems slightly misogynist as well. People have said that about the A Song of Ice & Fire series, but I disagree due to the nuanced female characters and perspectives. The Witcher series, with its sole male POV and sexist universe, cannot say the same.My review of The Last Wish
