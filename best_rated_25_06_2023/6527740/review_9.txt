☠ +|+ Warning→ Do not read this review because it is not for the easily offended as it contains masses of swearing, rage and crude sarcasm and if you can't handle it then look on. Last Sacrifice in a nutshell? Bullshit topped with every STD imaginable. Last Sacrifice should die a painful, painful death for:-1.) Using a goldigging whore who uses only her sexuality to get what she wants and holds about as much brainpower as an empty glass. Are we supposed to see Rose some sort of role model and the ideal “strong female character” when she truly isn’t one?!2.) Glorifying a romance that seemed to match with child grooming & ephebophilia, when really the foundation for the romance was a statutory rape masqueraded as a “lust charm”, hero-worship, and sex. Lots of it.3.) Making it seem perfectly fine that if your lover fucked your brains out in the bedroom but then constantly demean (because of your age and your sexuality) you then he is your soul mate. No question. Even if he turns into a malevolent creature of the night and emotionally and physically abuses you, makes you his blood-whore against your will and sends you creepy love letters, you should still by all means lust after… I mean love him because he is soooo hot and sexy and his tiny penis rocks your fucking world.4.) For creating inextricable situations (potentially possessing momentum for a great series had the dumb bitch of an author gone about it correctly) but then having deux es machinas in the form of characters to immediately solve the problems so our Mary Sue and Gary Stu shitheads can have plenty of time to snag each other some more.5.) Destroying potential of developed, lovable characters and the plot- all for catering to stupid hormonal, sexually deprived virgins (who probably use an icicle to masturbate over fictional characters) just to get some bucks even if it means losing your dignity while you’re at it. Also, if you do happen to have a copy of this book, I suggest that you burn it because it makes a great Christmas fireplace. Or just recycle it. Be a friend to the environment! *thumbs up*I hated the conclusion to the series, knowing that it would go downhill from Shadow Kiss onwards- Blood Promise was a filler likewise Spirit Bound, both books were just two halves of one big bullshit. Last Sacrifice was on a whole new level of ‘shit’ for me- predictable plotline (I could have just read shit fan fiction and could not tell the difference between that and Last Sacrifice), vapid heroines, tedious & mind-numbing romance that consisted of- humping like rabbits 75% of the time and the other 25%- pointless declarations of love and we witness Richelle Mead’s stupid philosophical explanation on the romance of Rose and Dimitri. It’s great for checking your upchuck reflexes! Mine were working fine!I don’t think I can gather together the entire plot to give you a coherent synopsis because reading Last Sacrifice meant I finally understood that the “last sacrifice” was my fucking brain cells, I do not want to endure that again. Secondly there was so much bullshit and since I am such a kind, thoughtful person- I wouldn’t want to burden you with it. But here’s a short synopsis:-► Rose is in prison (where she should belong, the dumbass) and her deux es machina of a dad comes along and tells her that in 2 weeks she could be dead if the trial goes wrong. That perks my interest.► Because Richelle Mead seems to be a huge fan of unrealistic prison breaks, Rose’s friends break her out through impossible means because of course Rose has unlimited amount of luck.► She & Dimitri escape together (it’s so obvious that Tatiana’s murder was so they could get together and ~mend their shagromance. During this escape, all she can do is drool over his butt while telling herself she isn’t over him and may I say she does a convincing job. Not.)► Rose jizzes her pants over Dimitri. When does she not?► Then Sydney is blackmailed by Abe to look after Rose and Dimitri and make sure they keep hidden until Abe & Co. prove Rose’s innocence. What was honestly the fucking point of the prison break? Weren’t they trying to do that in the first place?► Meanwhile, Lissa is nominated as a candidate for Queen of the Moroi and faces physical/emotional/mental tests in order to show she is capable of being Queen. Along with that, her, Christian and Adrian play Sherlock Holmes and Watson and try to find out who the killer is.► Victor and Robert invade Rose’s dream, and for some fucking reason she trusts them into telling them about where she is and the Last Dragomir even though Victor is the one who forced her to be almost raped by Dimitri and tortured her best friend. I couldn’t think of a better person, could you? So now that they are BBFs and after they give each other friendship bracelets- they team up to find Sonya Karp and turn her back into Moroi so she can tell them about who the bastard child of Eric Dragomir is.► They turn Sonya Karp (Deux Es Machina #No. I-lost-count— the unlimited Luck strikes again!) back into a Moroi and unsurprisingly it turns out that Jailbait Deux Es Machina- I mean Jill- is Lissa’s half sister, is this supposed to be some sort of amazing, shocking revelation? ► It turns out that Victor is the evil mastermind that he was always in the fucking books, and he kidnaps Jill, but then Rose comes in with her God Mode Sue powers and saves her and then kills Victor. She feels bad for about 3 seconds and then proceeds to drool over Dimitri’s cock.► Rose and Dimitri shag (because it’s the only drive in their pathetic relationship) may I say that this is while she is still Adrian’s girlfriend. Oh but don’t worry… the cheating is A-OK… because she luuuurrrves Dimitri so fucking much that she just had to give into fucking his nonexistent brains out. Also, Rose’s aura glows like the fucking sun when she is acting like a whore. Isn’t this like 24/7?► They then return to court with Jill and Rose hands her over to Moroi royals like a dog and then blurts that Eric Dragomir is a manwhore in front of the entire Moroi population thus humiliating her best friend who is supposed to be a candidate for Queen.► Lissa becomes Queen, Tasha is the killer, Dimitri is Christian’s guardian (even though he was just a Strigoi 3 weeks ago) so Rose and him can shag and protect them at the same time, the bond goes away for like no fucking reason, Rose tears out Adrian’s heart and then Rose rides Dimitri’s dick into the sunset doing it whilst over a pile of bodies that sacrificed their asses so the fucktarded romance between Rose/Dimitri can happen. Rose, of course, feels no remorse at all and Dimitri being the retarded asshole justifies her actions, why not shove your head up her ass too, you fucker? The inconsistency in the plot is incredibly repetitive- first of all Dimitri has no side-effects at all from subsequent to being a Strigoi? It’s only logical that he should, be a much darker being of himself than he should be or even being mentally unstable, am I right? Nope. Because he realises that Rose’s hair is sooooo beautiful, luscious, soft, and silky with no ammonia (honest to God, it sounded like a hair advert)… that he has a standing orgasm and becomes conscious of the fact that life is worth living for… her hair. Her hair made him realise that he missed acting like a child groomer by feeling her up and then acting like a complete shithead afterwards and now he wants to live that life again? Are you fucking kidding me? That doesn’t prove fuck all that he loved her but he has a hair fetish. Disgusting motherfucker.Also, how Richelle Mead made Rose cheating on Adrian seem like no big deal because Dimitri is her soul mate. Oh really? Because that totally justifies the fact that Adrian treated her as an equal, cared for her, gave her what she wanted and loved her will never match the incredible power of Dimitri’s sex factor and how hot he is. That was beyond cruel, especially to a character that I have grown to love right the way through the whole series, for Rose to get into bed with another man while she was with him, and then turn the tables to blame him for depending on her. I'm sorry, I’ve never seen Adrian depend on her for anything during the course of this catastrophic plot so why Rose using this as an excuse? She was a goldigging whore. I'm surprised she doesn’t yet dress in cheapskate designer and have Chola brows with huge earrings. End of story. I cannot believe there are some idiots on here who seem to think that Rose is a strong female character when she uses her killer, curvy body and her whorishness sexuality to get what she wants. She has neither intelligence nor the emotional strength to be a good heroine. Also what made me sick was how Dimitri said that he “liked”, “respected” Adrian, & could “never take another man’s woman” yet for a guy who seems to have “amazing self control”- he still fucked her. (I hope to God, Rose & Dimitri gets HIV/AIDS and herpes after this.) The son of a whore is a hypocrite and he is now exactly like his dad, to be honest I'm not surprised that he turned out into what he is now: a child-grooming, perverted prick. Cheating/adultery are no way justifiable; I don’t give a flying rat’s ass if you happen to meet your soul mate, it’s still immoral so I don’t understand why this daft author think she can get away with it- considering your book is aimed at teenagers.→ Also the digression of Tasha’s character- Tasha is supposed to be fierce, intelligent and strong yet we see her as a crazed, jealous bitch that loved Dimitri and tried to frame that goldigging slut through royal assassination because she couldn’t stand the fact that she lost to a stupid, dumbass whore? What the fuck? Since when did her character do a U-Turn or is Tasha a bi-polar psychopath?→ The Ozeras have already been condemned for Christian’s parents’ actions; they don’t need a murder to top the fucking list. Christian has been degraded for the whole Strigoi incident and this whole murder plotline was uncalled for and a nuisance, he shouldn’t have to deal with another person’s reputation on his shoulders and why, oh why, was her character beaten into a psychotic murderer of a character?→ Lissa being Queen wasn’t at all predictable! *sarcasm* Of course, you’d expect her to pass all the tests and then become Queen. The only reason why she is Queen is so Rose and Dimitri can get away with the bullshit that they get up to. Hell, you know what this means, right? Rose and Dimitri can shag on Tatiana’s grave or Dimitri could even piss from the highest tower in court, and those motherfuckers would get away with it because Queen Lissa would back them up as only she is allowed to pass judgement.→ There was not enough of Christian/Adrian in this book; I loved the bromance and the banter between these two, which seemed to develop into a warm friendship. It was the only redeeming part of the book (other than Christian and Lissa’s relationship). The snarky comments were amusing and did lighten my stormy mood for the duration of the book, and it convinced me to think that Adrian/Christian would be one amazing duo and I’d rather have the spinoffs be about their adventures than some boring ass bitch like Jill. → Christian and Lissa are my only favourite canon pairing right now- honestly I love how they strengthened each other to be a better person, and his support for her during the time she was doing her tests was so endearing. What made me sad is that this healthy, balanced relationship which wasn’t about motherfucking “lust-charms” (rape is more like it) and “cabin-sex-awesomeness” was overshadowed largely by two assholes who honestly should look into getting jobs in the Dhampir porn industry seeing as Rose is halfway there. They had completely opposite characteristics, they initially clashed but they had something called development, they didn’t let the other put them down and solved their issues in a sensible way. See? That is a fucking relationship! Not a one night stand with a perverted child groomer whose hobbies consist of reading cowboy novels, and sessions involving lotion, tissue and never ending lonely nights. Well, he has Rose now, so “the-curse-of-continuous-masturbation” has finally been broken. Good for him, that big slut! *sassy gay friend reference*→ Adrian- I loved him in this and glad that he didn’t let Rose walk all over likewise Spirit Bound, he called out on her shit and said that she was a goldigging skank who didn’t give a flying fuck about anyone else but her Russian sex-master. He doesn’t and didn’t deserve Rose at all, and I'm hoping he gets together with some vodka and some Las Vegas showgirls to show him a good time. I wished he had gotten together with Avery, they were a gorgeous couple back in Blood Promise, but obviously Richelle Mead is a sadistic bitch who doesn’t like seeing anyone but dumb bitches and assholes happy! Adrian has developed a lot as a character, more so than the main two as well as some other secondary characters, he was entertaining and charming and I had hoped he’d get his happy ending (just not with Jailbait and Sydney) but he got the short end of the fucking stick. The stick was probably up Dimitri’s ass anyway.→ Dimitri “should-be-in-prison-for-being-such-a-fugly-grenade-who-spends-his-time-getting-pubescent-ass-and-ruining-dusters-for-the-rest-of-us” Belikov, I think you’ve heard about my burning hatred for him and I don’t think I can ever complain about him enough- in short he is an exotic child molester who changes his personality faster than Rose rides people’s dicks who ruined Russia for me. Honestly? His ass should get back to soviet Russia where women don’t take that shit from him. Or, you know, Stalin kicks his fucking ass. I��ve never wanted to snap someone’s dick off and shoved it up someone’s ass, and this character is fictional. I'm tired of his stupid repetitive chat up lines- “you are so beautiful it hurts me and because you are a naïve attention whore I just say so I can get some pussy LOL.”- he should be working for Hallmarks or some other crappy card making company so half-witted romantics can fall for his lines and the sex scenes sucked donkey dick! I could write a better sex scene and I'm a virgin- hell the Edward and Bella pillow biting sex scene in Breaking Dawn was porn compared to the sex Rose and Dimitri have. Tatiana/Ambrose turned me on more than they ever could!→ Jill was a boring, basic ass bitch who is a plot device so Lissa can be queen therefore shag-a-thon ‘10 is able to happen. It was pretty obvious that she was going to be Lissa’s sister because you can’t have her kissing asses all day long, you have to make her seem important while kissing ass. Sydney- I don’t mind her character but she isn’t Jesus to me- but the way Rose left her to rot in prison and then didn’t even think twice about her angered the crap out of me. Same with Eddie- who was the only Dhampir I liked throughout the entire series- he had brains and he was committed for calling Rose out on his shit yet he met a horrible end. I cannot stand it when such amazing characters such as him have an undeserved ending yet the skank ass bitch lives in luxury.→ Rose is just a fucking cum dumpster for Dimitri; she is a skank-ass-monkey-fucking whore who deserves to cut with a chainsaw and a blunt axe. How is she living? She is too fucking stupid to live and she should have just died in that fucking car accident instead of Lissa’s family. She is a shit guardian; her vocabulary does not surpass “bad ass” and “God”, she should have been sent off to a bloodwhore commune because that’s what she should have graduated as: the WHORE OF MONTANA. The pacing was horrible and the book was set out badly, I don’t know if Richelle Mead actually has editors or baboons scratching their asses over her manuscripts. There was no element of surprise, or suspense or anything exciting at all, I was excited finishing the fucking book. It was just shit and should be thrown into a fire. So everyone, save your gas bills by burning copies of Last Sacrifice :D
