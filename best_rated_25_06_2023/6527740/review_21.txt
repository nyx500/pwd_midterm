In a world full of Kardashians, be a Rose Hathaway! üòèNow I've got your attention, right? :)) Good. Let's move on. First of all, let me applaud this amazing woman who wrote this series. Dear Richelle, You have no idea how much I loved this series. 7 years ago and now too. Dimitri was my dream guy since 2012 until now and I really think he's going to be until the end of my days. Once upon a time, I started a series about a badass girl who would do anything to protect the ones she loved. She was my inspiration, my role model as a character and the one who made me laugh while reading all 6 books from the VA series. This series was a magic portal to a world full of twists and turns, fighting and protecting, love and hate, intrigues and plans carefully thought, amazing and strong characters and a story that I couldn't forget even if I tried too. So... thank you! Thank you for giving me moments of joy, thank you for introducing me to the man of my dreams... and thank you for the perfect ending. With all my respect, C.
