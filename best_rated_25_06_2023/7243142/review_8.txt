The conclusion to the five book series focusing on a brother and sister who discover a magical world run by their grandparents. I'm in the minority for loving it way more than Harry Schmotter, er, Potter. :) Anyway, without giving spoilers there are a good number of twists and minor to moderate surprises. Mind you, that's for an adult reading the book. I suspect teen agers might be more amazed by things and such. Bracken was the most interesting secondary character and the verbal duels with the Sphinx as well as the many fairy preserves were thought provoking. PAGE COUNT: 544 pp.; WHEN READ: March to July 2010; MY GRADE: B to B plus.
