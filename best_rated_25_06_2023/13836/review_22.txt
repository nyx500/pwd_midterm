This has to be my absolute favourite series by Tamora Pierce. I was a little scared for the re-read, because I was a bit worried that it wouldn't hold up to my memories, but I am happy that wasn't the case.Daine has always been very close to animals. Despite not having 'the Gift', there seems to be something magical about the way that she can communicate with them. When Daine has to flee her home, she is offered a job working with horses that changes her life. Now she's on the road to Tortall with friends and a future. Of course, being Tortall, things there aren't completely peaceful. Thankfully, with some training, Daine will be ready for the task of helping to protect her home and new-found friends.This is one of the formative books of my childhood, with a kickass main character. She doesn't pick up a sword or become a knight, but her way of fighting is just as important. The plot in this book is a bit light, it sets up the Immortals and leaves a lot of threads open. It also is a great time for catching up of our favourite characters from Alanna.
