So. I've read up to page 216 now and there isn't really anything that urges me to read on. I have heard so many good things about this book and Tamora Pierce's books in general come highly recommended by some of my Goodreads friends. But I fear that if I haven't found anything that makes me want to go on up until now, I probably won't find it in the next 150 pages either. Please don't understand this as a discouragement to give Pierce's books a try - this is in no way a bad book, it's just not for me. I found it hard to get into the writing style; the narractive kind of hops between the different characters in mid-paragraph every now and then - and that perspective felt a bit weird to me. Also, I wasn't particularly fond of the main character, Daine. Her voice is a tad bit too young for my taste (she is 13) and she comes across as a little too perfect with her special talents concerning animals and the strong magic she has without even knowing it. All in all, she is a characters that can often be found in epic fantasy: an orphan with special talents who finds new friends and a master who helps her control her unknown abilities and come to terms with her past. In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with this kind of character in general. Although it has been done a hundred times before, a skilled author can always add something new to the story. And Tamora Pierce definitely is a skilled author, but in this case, Daine's story just didn't resonate with me personally. Despite all that, I really liked the idea behind her magic and the focus on animals in this novel.Now I'm unsure if I should give another one of Pierce's Tortall series a try. I wasn't fond of the writing style in this one - so if they are similar in style, they might simply not be for me. On the other hand - a character to root for might change my opinion.#2 TBR Pile Reduction Challenge (Olivia: I'm sorry I didn't like this more, I was definitely counting on it.)
