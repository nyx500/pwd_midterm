Wild Magic literally changed my life. It was the first series I read with a strong girl as the protagonist (I read this before her Alanna series), and I wanted nothing more than to leave my horrible junior high behind and drop into Daine's shoes--even with all the bad stuff that happens to her. I mean, the girl can talk to animals!This is an older book, so while it might have been YA when I was younger, it would definitely qualify if as MG these days. Don't let that scare you--there's still SO much to take from this book and the entire series.Daine faces here fears, ignores the hurt, and battles on (just like Alanna from the Lioness Quartet, yet in a completely different way). She's a subdued heroine--strong in her own quiet way. As a painfully shy thirteen-year-old, I LOVED this. I learned so much from Daine's approach to her problems, and I'm not lying when I say Tamora Pierce and her novels shaped me into the person I am today.Don't miss this book!
