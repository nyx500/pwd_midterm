This is my third series with this author - all in less than a month. Yep, that’s how much I am LOVING Ms. Pierce’s work! The writing is truly a joy to read and the stories are almost unputdownable. Daine has been a side character in both The Protector of the Small Series and the Daughter of the Lioness duo. In both, she was such an interesting character that I had to learn her story… Even though I could no longer get the books at the library and stupid S&S are charging MORE for the kindle books than for the hard copies (gosh, big publishers annoy me!) SO… it speaks to the fact that I would give in and purchase them anyway, that’s just how good these books are.This first of four begins with Daine as a 13 year old orphan who has a weird talent that she doesn’t understand and others in her village see as so dangerous they believe she is a monster that must be put down. She runs away and is hired as a horsewoman’s apprentice, however, and thus begins an epic journey of discovery that is an absolute joy to take. I can’t wait to dive into the second book!
