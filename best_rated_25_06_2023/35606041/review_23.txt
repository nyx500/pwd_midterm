By the dead, this is the best fantasy novel I read this year. Six out of five bloody stars. This novel is one helluva breathless ride. Joe Abercrombie is one of the most entertaining writers I've ever read. Don't expect too much literary, poetic stuff. He has carved his own niche. Like most of his characters, his writing is lean, mean, cheeky and exhilarating at the same time. Show-don't-tell principle is applied with very little exposition, supported by great pacing. I never feel bored. I lose sleep; my eye bags are currently a courtesy of this book. All of those added with memorable, layered characters with very distinct voices. Yeah, I know, I just basically described his First Law novels. They are THAT good, and this book continues that tradition, if not even more glorious. A word of advice though, please take your time to read the previous books in the First Law world first before reading this book, as there are lots of nuances and background that will enrich your experience.
