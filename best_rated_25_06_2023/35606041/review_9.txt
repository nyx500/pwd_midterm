It's been more than six year since I read "Red Country", and I waited for him to release "Wisdom of Crowds" so I can read them back to back. And my patience paid off because this book was just fantastic to kick things off. A new cast of characters was introduced and there were also special appearances by some of the best from the First Law world. In true Abercrombie fashion this book sets the stage for what is coming next as we here were get acquainted with these new heroes and villains. For now am not sure who is good and evil, and I think this author just does it the best. No one shows their true colors, everyone being on their best behaviors with a hidden knife somewhere on them. So I know I am going to keep switching sides until I settle for one. While First Law trilogy did not have many females in the lead, here we have two very strong ladies, Rikke and Savine who are the daughters of Dogman and Glokta respectively. And they both took after their fathers, strong, and savage. Then there is Vit, though her role was smaller as compared to other two here but I have high hopes for her in this series. I have a hunch that she is going to be crucial in next two books. As for men, they are no different than the others in other first law world books. Its a classic Joe Abercrombie in every way.
