4th read: October 2021 buddy read with caitlin bunny <3 3rd read: August 2017  2nd read: June 2017 I just can't get over this book. It is absolutely  stunning. This is a book I will continuously re-read throughout my life, and is especially great to read when you are becoming too consumed in the adult world. I'm in my exam period currently, so reading this now was perfect. I also listened to the audio book for this re-read, and the narrator was perfect for this story (and he is Australian!)
