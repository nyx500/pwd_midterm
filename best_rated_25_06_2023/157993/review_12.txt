“It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”I remember, when I was little, I had this round CD case and it contained an audiobook. Now as a child I loved audiobooks, or someone reading stories to me. Still do today, actually. Anyway, the audiobook was titled The Little Prince, and I listened to it quite often. That, however, was at least 10 years ago, possibly more. So I decided that it was time for a reread. (I'm sorry to say that I cannot find the CD anywhere. Maybe my mom gave it away.)Rereading this brought up nostalgia and melancholia. This is a very cute, very sad book, and I don't like the ending very much. I don't understand why the Prince couldn't just fly back to his planet. You know, instead of dying. Or did he die? Didn't he? I think he just left his body behind and returned anyway. But still...why make it so sad when it was already sad enough?This is a beautiful tale of childhood, love and friendship. One that I wouldn't have wanted to miss.Find more of my books on Instagram
