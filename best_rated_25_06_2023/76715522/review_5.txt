I had impossibly high hopes for this book. I make no secret that this is my favourite book series. Yet somehow, every book just seemed to get better than the last. Could SJM possibly do it again. Yes, she can, and she did. Wow, what an epic finale.The book is a perfect length, though close to a thousand pages, not a single line is wasted. Every possible loose end is tied up. Every hint or hidden story leads to this masterpiece.The story is awesome. The character development and use are unreal. Every characters' moderation and reasoning is spot on. Every character has something to contribute. However, we still know who the hero of the series is.Action, adventure, suspense, and such intense emotion evoking writing. This could not have been done better. As mad as I was for having to wait an extra couple of years for this book to come out, it was worth the wait. I can not find a single negative thing to say about this book. Except the series is over. Though I think almost any surviving characters are good enough to have their own book (hint/begging). Aelin/Celaena is my favourite female character of all time. Strong, deadly, intelligent, and most of all, she "will not yield." I love that quote, and I honestly do not think it can be applied better to any other character.This is an awesome finale to the most awesome series after reading that all other games of thrones are secondary. "The Queen that was promised" delivers big time.
