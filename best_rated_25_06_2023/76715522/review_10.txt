Here is my updated shelf!Here's my big boxed set with poster. And below it is my shelf with the goodies! 11-1-18 Got my UK Edition with the beautiful art cards inside! If you want to see pictures of my wall art then just scroll all the way down past the other pictures. This is how much I love this series. Also, let it be known (that I'm crazy) that I have the hardback, audible, kindle, special paperback on its way and then ordered the complete hardback box set! Yeah!THIS. BOOK. WAS. EVERYTHING.... TO ME!I loved this last installment so much. All of the characters I love were in it. There was torture, sadness, war, happiness and so much more. I cried <-- I mean of course I did, that's what I do! I'm not giving out any spoilers, I just wanted to say it's perfect for me. I really wish it never came to an end but there are only certain things you can do in certain series without messing it up. At least, that's my take on it. I really have no words peeps. I'm going to leave it here because there are so many that are going to be talking about this, I really wish I had a real life friend that read books that I do so we could talk on the phone about it. Anyhoo, enjoy my pictures. I have some funko's I'm making slowly and changing the ones I have made. I am working on a couple of walls that I have dedicated to book art and my photography! I hated removing those book shelves but I'm loving my art. (Will do a wall and new bookshelf tour later on) This first pic is just a couple of things. Later on I will do the whole shelf tour when more things arrive and get made. My wall art of Aelin & Rowan And the beautiful, Manon! More to come my lovelies ... xoxoMel â™¥ BLOGAMAZON
