I am in tears. This was absolutely perfect. I have no complaints, no remarks, no anything. I wouldn't change it at all. SJM wrote a masterpiece and am absolutely in awe of it 😭❤️KoA is easily the best book in the series for me. Sure, it's hugee. But the characters, the story, the romance, the war and sheer beauty of it all was mesmerizing to read.  How come there's no tv series for it yet?!  It started with such intensity and heaviness. Aelin, Rowan and Fenrys are the winners for me in this book, they broke and mend my heart. Chaol and Dorian coming in next, with Manon, Lorcan and Elide at the end. I know it's an odd way of ranking but that's the way they impacted me. If you haven't read this series, DO READ IT. Pls 🥺🥺 I have some theories in my drafts but before posting them. I want to reread ACOTAR and CC. ~•~•~Y'all have me so scared to start this one but here I go. Also, after this I officially start my reread of ACOTAR and CC- am ready to start theorizing for CC3
