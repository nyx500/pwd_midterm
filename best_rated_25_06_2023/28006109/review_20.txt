3.5 stars rounded up.In the fourth instalment in the Trials of Apollo, we find Meg and Apollo at Camp Jupiter, surrounded by some familiar faces, as they bring a fallen hero to their final resting place. It’s a somber mood, one that’s quickly interrupted by the appearance of zombies that have a message for Apollo from another old enemy. And with Commodus and Caligula hot on their heels, things soon build up to an epic showdown for control of New Rome. A showdown that’s sure to have more devastating consequences. The growth of Apollo’s character is really apparent throughout this book. There’s less whining, less talk of being useless, and there’s a sense of camaraderie between the group as they work well together and really bond. There’s a real sense of love and friendship that’s grown over time between Meg and Apollo, and it feels genuine. I also enjoyed the relationships between Apollo, Reyna, Hazel and Frank. They all bounce off each other well, bring out the best sides of their personalities. A certain daughter of Terpsichore is also a delight, bringing humour (and diversity) to an already fairly eclectic group. The plot also advances quite a bit here too. Gone are the subtleties and secrets of the earlier books, and this is high on the action and battles with a range of monsters, birds and silent Gods for Apollo to face, and confront more demons of his past. As always, it was interesting to see Apollo face up to the consequences of his actions as a selfish God, and shows his character development well. After such an explosive ending, I’m really looking forward to the thrilling conclusion and ultimate showdown against Nero next year.
