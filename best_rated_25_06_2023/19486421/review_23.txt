Holy shit this book is so good. I think I like it more overall than Changes, but Changes has a much more emotionally affecting ending, and that's what really drives it home for me. So this is slightly below Changes. But man, Skin Game is so fun and chock full of fantastic character moments and cool, fist pumping scenes. Dresden Files is a wild, wild ride.
