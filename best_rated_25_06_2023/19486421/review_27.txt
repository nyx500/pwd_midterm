Definitely one of the best books in the series to date. A totally absorbing, fast paced plot from start to finish. Harry is coerced by his boss, Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness, into helping one of his arch enemies carry out a heist in the underworld. He is not at all happy about it but understands that Mab has a secondary role for him, if only he survive to carry it out. Also he has this thing in his head that’s going to kill him in three days time so he is also racing the clock.There are some scary members of the team involved in the heist who would like nothing better than to kill Harry once his role is complete and he will need to call on more than one of his human friends to help him get out alive. There are so many times in the plot when there seems to be no way out but Butcher keeps pulling fresh ideas out of his hat to allow Harry to carry on. Non stop drama and an excellent ending!  However, I was disappointed that Butcher didn’t allow us to witness the removal of the thing in Harry’s head after the build up to it.
