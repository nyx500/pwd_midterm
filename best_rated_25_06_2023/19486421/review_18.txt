Do these ratings surprise anybody anymore at this point? These books are fucking awesome. This series started out as a villain of the week crime series and has evolved so much since then. I've loved it since Storm Front but basically everything post-Blood Rites is just on a totally different level. Power levels keep going up, more characters are involved in the story than they ever have been before, Harry has been through countless traumatic events, the list of everything that this series gets right is a long one.
