I wanted to love this book. But it has many flaws. I'll get to that in a few, but first, let me gush about what's great about it. The plot/premise is brilliant. I love the idea of a modern black woman being propelled back into time to help one of her white ancestors to survive, even if he becomes a mean and despicable slave master. I love the fact that it used time travel, which I usually hate, but found tolerable here. I love the observations of the protagonist, Dana. She's an interesting character, with a lot of strength, and some flaws that I found believable. The book is easy to read, but perhaps that's where I start my critique. It sometimes over simplifies in an effort to push through the story. There was a lot of opportunity for complexity, and the author sorta takes the easy way out in many instances. Also, it feels a little dumbed down at times, and the author tries too hard to explain some things, and it comes off as contrived. In other instances, though, she doesn't explain enough, like why Dana is traveling through time in the first place. Overall though, it's a really ambitious and brilliant concept, and a fascinating read. We need more African-American novels that use paranormal elements to explore socio-historical issues. I applaud Octavia Butler for taking the risk and pulling it off, mostly.
