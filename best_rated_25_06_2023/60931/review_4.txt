4.5 starsâ€œBetter to stay alive," I said. "At least while there's a chance to get free."Dana and her husband just settled into their first house together when she...disappeared.Like, literally disappeared. One minute she was there and the next minute she was rescuing a drowning white boy.And when she turns around, she gets called the n-word by his parents as they demand an explanation for a slave to be out and about like she is.And then she zips back to the future to her white husband.Shocked, shaken and disturbed, Dana slowly realizes that the child she rescued, Rufus, is her many times great ancestor. And as she begins to disappear again, she realizes that in order for her to stay alive, she's going to have to survive these time-jumps long enough to keep her ancestor alive.She means the devil with people who say you're anything but what you are.Whew.This is one for the ages.This book was truly incredible. And awful. And gut-wrenching. And heart-breaking. It was the first science fiction work written by a black woman and she truly knocked it out of the park. I am truly struggling with my descriptions - all I really have to say is check it out. You can read all the history books in the world but nothing hits quite like a story set on a slave plantation in the 1800s.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
