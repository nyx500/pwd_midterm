I remember every details from what I wore & who gave it to me as my late bday present (I owe her!) to which parts I read fast.I was in the generation who looked forward every HP books & movies to come. & in the gaps, I re-read them. XDI am first generation Potterhead.BIG FAN! Hardcore!since 2000-1Childhood Nostalgia. <3I experienced the First book-related feelings with this series; first bookish crush (Harry), first World I wanted to go there & be part of it, first fantasy, first novel, first favourite Hero, first cliff-hanger (HP 4), first book hangover (HP 4, 5, maybe a bit in 2), first shock & cry over a dead character & first favourite villainmany good memories.You probably ask:"After all this time?"& I reply:....."Always.” I just re-read & re-read HP Always from the beginning to the book recently had come out. that's why I say: I'm a professional re-reader. I love re-reading, because those stories never get old for me!I miss them very often; the characters, Hogwarts, magic, the excitement, the fun & the admiration of how Perfect this world is & how magnificent it is written. the Nostalgic feeling it gives me. I just feel like to re-read them once in a while, & I still can't read from the middle, I just want to experience it all over again, since the beginning, again going through all those character developments & events I perfectly know would happen.even though I know almost every sentences & events & I know how it ends!When I'm in Harry Potter mode, I bring my wand, waving it just to have some magic. sometimes my parents get on with it & it is actually a total fun.really nothing, no books, no movies, no shows can fill this place in my heart, a place beats only for Harry Potter & resurfaced occasionally.I loved with HarryI laughed with HarryI cried with HarryI felt like Harry (about characters & situation)I was excited with HarryI was angry with Harry& I was scared with Harry■ 1st year, we got to know a whole new world with Harry, we received our letters, we went to Hogwarts, we learnt magic, we had many adventures, many riddles. We cheered during Quidditch. We saved the Stone.■ 2nd year, I felt sad for Harry on his birthday. We met a wizard family, we flew to Hogwarts, we witnessed some horrors, we knew Harry was not behind the attacks. We solved the mystery. We found the Chamber.■ 3rd year, again, Harry’s birthday ruined, sympathy for him rising, he broke the rules, again. then he started to fight for his problem, to be strong. At the end, we face the Prisoner./We rescued the Prisoner■ 4th year, what is more exciting than a Quidditch world cup!? Yes! A tournament! But before, we saw scenes that made us worried. Everything went wrong because of the Goblet/We were chosen by Goblet .■ 5th year, Harry’s worried & angry, we were outraged because of that pink toad. We stepped up against the unfair obligation. At last, we fought along with the Order.■ 6th year, everything's darker, world’s darker, Harry’s being even more Sassy. We knew more about You-know who. At the end, we recognized the Prince.■ 7th year, 17 at last, to find a way to fight Voldemort, to defeat him. I was proud of his bravery. We defended the world & we mastered the Hallows.top 3 places of my HP favourite books, in order:1) the Chamber of Secrets- the Order of the Phoenix- the Goblet of Fire2) the Deathly Hallows- the Philosopher's Stone3) the Prisoner of Azkaban& my least fav is: the Half-Blood Princejust as how Not-Ordinary Harry was, I am an extraordinary fan too; the book many people didn't like is my top favourite & the one which is everyone's favourite is my least favourite.there's no shame in loving all-potterhead's least favourite book, because it made the best times for me; the most excitements & feelz. I am proud :)& I love how this series is at first more middle grade, then slowly turned into YA when the characters are older & the world is darker.One of the best series I've ever read. made my childhood MAGICAL! thank you Queen Rowling! *put my hands in the air*regardless of the age; everyone can enjoy it.Now as I'm thinking, I see the whole series is 2-parted; first part magical, cute & bright (my favourite here is Chamber of Secrets) & second part, the world is darker, more complicated & they are growing older. (my favourite here is Order of the Phoenix)you know what I say?more professional view:🟇 A Whole New World of magic with wands, school setting, ghosts, potions, charms, Fantastic Beasts & Plants, secrets & everything a world/society need!:▸ Hogwarts: the school of Witchcraft & Wizardry. That magnificent Castle we all desired to go there.& how to get there: through Platform 9¾.Lessons & Books for educational purposes! (which I happily would read them all; History of Magic to Hogwarts: A history, the Standard book of spells grade 1-7, Advanced Potion Making, One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi or even all Gilderoy Lockhart's books.)Backstory of Hogwarts.How wizard families lives.& the ministry of Magic.All created by Rowling, all aspects of a realistic world, of life. even the Queen invented a wizarding Sport & its worldcup! & even stories & toys for their children. I can go on forever...the castle itself & the wizarding education; surely, we all want to eat in the Great Hall, explore this mysterious castle, walk in those spectacular corridors, , wander on the grounds, & learn all those interesting magical lessons.& I love that we went to all the places as the story going on, not just being introduced to us by naming them. the plot was so perfectly weaved that we had a reason to experience being there; we went to Forbidden Forest (many times!), the Chamber of Secrets, the world cup, the Ministry of Magic, the St. Mungo's, even the department of mysteries. (also Harry had a logical reason to be around when there was a important conversation was going on, by his curiosity, by the help of his invisibility cloak, by nightmares (we even experienced the night of Jily's death & I cry like hell every time I read it) or because he was in the right place at the right time) that's the perfect & practical way to give hints of explanations other than just someone telling the story to the characters, that the main characters are actually involved.& by each book, the world expanded; in first book we knew the magical world & Hogwarts, in 2nd we saw a wizard family. in 3rd we dealt with the wizard prison, Azkaban. in 4th we had a Quidditch world cup, other magic schools & dark side followers. in 5th we've been in the Ministry of Magic, politics & another pureblood family. in 6 we knew more about Hogwarts past, the world is cold & darker. in 7 we traveled around & you know what happened.🟇 Different Characters, all well-written, realistic & believable, also easy to hear them talking; with different tunes & words of choices. with different emotions; sadness, enthusiasm, gladness, willing, evilness, coldness....& You can't just Love one; tbh, I have many favourite characters in this series. Harry, Weasley twins, Hermione, Ron, James, Regulus, Dobby, Lupin, McGonagall, Wood, Hagrid, Mr. & Mrs. Weasley, Seamus, Lee Jordan & his Quidditch commentating, Sirius, Ginny, Flitwick, Krum, Bill, Fleur, Moody, even Voldy & Crouch, Malfoys, Lockhart & many more <3they were not just characters for me, I lived with them & they made my childhood, they made my personality. they helped me dealing with life difficulties. when I was younger, I asked myself what would Harry do in this situation? (& at that times, Harry Potter sage wasn't even complete) Harry was always there, one of my imaginary friends who helped me a lot.Thank you Harry!Thank you Queen!🟇 Well-written; every events explained wonderful, magnificent & every details of the locations & situations described very beautiful (I could imagine them easily) & even magical at some points, brilliant & unique choices of the words, funny comments from characters (Twins, Ron, Sassy Harry, Hermione's sarcasms, Lee's Quidditch commentating, Wood & more), amazing moments of Adrenaline rush. Quidditch commentating were Marvelous & very fascinating!in the matter of fun moments, I should respect Harry in particular: (brilliant laughter moments!)Harry Potter isn't just the boy who lived, he's the boy who sassed.This young wizard is a Sass Master!the shocking PLOT TWISTS! every damn book!& feelz (sad or happy) which is necessary for a Great story. & one of the best thing about this series is that Romance is Not the MAIN part! like the life, people had crush on each other, breakup, jokes, peaces, love. but not in much detailed. People don't Always think about their crush/love, not devouring in affection, not always paralyzed, unable to think straight. the story is not romance-centric. it is realistic, like real life.& Harry as the POV character thinks too, but his thoughts are related to story not just his feelings, I always feel the same way as he does, he doubts (or if he thinks about his feeling about his crush, it is just beautiful & realistic.) & we can actually see if he was deep in thoughts, the story was going on. I love this writing style.full of iconic quotes, or inspirational ones, full of life lessons about responsibility, friendship & many other things.🟇 Chapters name were chosen Fantastic! (I love the novels with names for their chapters) they were brilliant, funny & sometimes magical. They made you curious what would happen in the chapter & after you read chapter, you see why the chapter name was that but before, it doesn't give it away! also HP was the only series which I didn't forget the chapters name. & I can guess which chapter is in which book. (or tell them by the events happening)some of my Favourite chapters are; the Flaw in the Plan (7), Beyond the Veil (5), the Only One who Ever Feared (5), Flesh, Blood & Bone (4), Priori Incantatem (4), the forest again (7), Heir of Slytherin (2), Dumbledore's army (5), O.W.L.s (5), Dudley Demented (5), Detention with Dolores (5), Snape's Worst Memory (5), Kreacher's tale (7), every Quidditch related chapter & many more!also, how Appropriate the titles of the books were chosen. Magnificent!🟇Life Lessons: there were full of inspirational quotes & hopefulness, full of lesson for real life, Friendship, facing your problems.I learnt to be Strong as Harry. Never give up,be Smart as Hermione,be Loyal as Ron,be Selfless as James,be Brave as Sirius,be Caring as Remus,be Outspoken as Lily,be Badass as McGonagall,be Innovative as Fred & George,do what was Right like Regulus,be Confident as Draco,be Determined as Tom,be Sincere as Charlie,be Daring as Ginny,be Kind as Molly,be Overjoyed by simple things as Arthur,& many other characters each thought me an aspect of life, an aspect of being a better self, a better human.(I can mention being Sassy as Harry & funny as twins too. but they're not exactly lessons of life, are they? XD)🟇 everything's Perfect! in another word: LEGENDARY!By Hogwarts express or by Flying Car,......oops! wrong quote, autocorrected, sorry... hem hem....here is the right one😉😆"Whether you come backby page or by the big screenHogwarts will always be there to Welcome you Home."- J.K.
