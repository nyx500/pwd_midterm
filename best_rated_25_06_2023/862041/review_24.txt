I have read the books AND listened to them on CD. Here's the story of how I became a fan of HP: I am an avid reader and years ago, when the Harry Potter books first came to the U.S. and caused such a sensation, I resisted reading them. I'm not a big fan of fantasy lit, so I thought that reading about wizards and such was not for me. It was as a mother of two cranky children that I ended up trying the books, and I am SO glad that I did not end up missing out on this brilliant and wonderful series.My kids and I were in an unpleasant rut. After a long day of teaching, I picked them up from their school. Our ride home was fraught with irritation. All three of us were tired and cranky. The kids bickered constantly. Then one day, I had a brainstorm. I stopped by the library and picked up the first Harry Potter book on tape. A magical change took place in our car! The long, dreary rides flew by. We began to look forward to our daily commutes. Listening together became quality time â€” the best part of our day! Jim Dale's narration of the series is truly magical. He changes his voice in hundreds of different ways to convey the various characters and their personalities. He brought an excitement to the stories that was just plain addictive. My children and I became avid fans of Harry Potter, and we went to the midnight book launchings of Books 6 and 7. Harry helped us get through a long and nasty divorce. I became known as the Harry Potter expert (and the books' biggest fan) at my school. I even went to a HP symposium in Las Vegas one summer, taking courses and spending time with other HP fanatics. HP changed my life in such a positive way. I will forever be grateful to J.K. Rowling for sharing her incredible story with all of us.
