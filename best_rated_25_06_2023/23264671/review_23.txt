Full review finally up after 16 yearsEverytime I think about writing a review for this book my brain goes into full-fledged panic mode so here’s my attempt -	So godsgrave takes place sometime after nevernights ending-	Mia is still out to get revenge for her familia by any means possible-	Note that in this book mia progresses to get even more bada*s, which yeah, I didn’t think was possible either -	There are more brutal deaths, more blood, more anguish, more deceit and betrayal and friendship and more of your favs dying!!! Yay!!-	Everyone has daddy issues in this book, I swear its like contagious -	Every single page is packed to the seams with witty remarks and someone being stabbed-	Jay kristoff needs to be sentenced to a life in candyland, his brain seems like a really scary place-	LIKE SOMEHOW A CHARACTER WILL BE INTRODUCED AND NOT 10 PAGES LATER THEY ARE DEAD AND I AM IN TEARS BC HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO NOT GET ATTACHED TO THEM-	Seriously tho-	Kristoffs ability to create a character and make you so bloody invested in them in a matter of seconds is unbelievable -	I went into this book like ‘ha, as long as mia lives I don’t care what happens’ BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BINCH YOU CARE SO MUCH-	Also its hilarious-	Everyone is a foul mouthed toad but it’s so funny youre laughing through the pain-	Around 84% of the time I had NO idea what was happening but I was like shaking from excitement bc that’s how this entire series works -	The little bixch gets better, I mean, I don’t FORGIVE her but her character does a lot of developing and plays a very necessary role in the plot-	The real star of the series tho: Mr. Kindly-	Where are eclipse and Mr. kindly and where can I find them bc I need them to help me plz-	And yes ofc Mia is stabby as always and very precious even though shes a terrible person that has done terrible things but I would die for her-	The real brotp is mia and mercurio tho-	Every time I read and something bad happened I was like lolz this is just a bad dream watch someone is gonna wake up soon but no it gets worse and then somehow it gets betters and then worse and basically it’s a seesaw that is set on fire and you just get hurt-	But  “Never Flinch.' A cold whisper in her ear. 'Never fear. And never, ever forget.'-	There are so many aspects of this book I cannot cover bc im so inadequate but im just letting you know that if you want gruesome and scary and gross all mashed together, then this book is going to murder you-	 The wolf does not pity the lamb,And the storm begs no forgiveness of the drowned.-	Also there are approximately 15 things that WERE JUST LEFT IN THIS CLIFFHANGER STATE WE ARE IN AND I CANT FUNCTION WITHOUT KNOWING ANY LONGER -	Also things are now gonna get a hell of a lot more complicated with that ending :) :) :) :)-	I don’t think jay kristoff is human, there is no other way to explain this book (s) Remember when books didn’t cause us physical pain? Yeah…me neither.5 stars!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~yes, here i am, 2 months late, finally reading this book.jay, i'm trusting you not to hurt any of my babies...except i know you are. just be nice to me, okay?also i want a special little binch to go bye bye
