I read this years ago, maybe ten, and wondered how it would measure up to my memory. Not bad.Salvatore is good at delivering what he promises. These are just fun action packed fantasy reads. With interesting places, memorable characters, exotic creatures and exciting battles. Although there are moments when he takes himself too seriously. When reading Forgotten Realms I'm not looking for philosophy you know?This is my favorite trilogy of the Drizzt books (a quick aside I enjoy Salvatore's writing but some of his names are just terrible). I like how each book has a theme and represents the journey of his youth. In Homeland we read about the drow and their homeworld. The family, religion, academic, and political aspects of their race. And although in this book they come across a little one dimensional (they get better) it's an interestingly different read. One of my favorite things about the character of Drizzt (and why I'm disappointed in later books) is his inherent goodness. He's not a flawed anti hero. He doesn't struggle with doing the right thing. He doesn't do the right thing because it's "right" (and actually in his world it's the wrong thing) but because it's instinct. But he also isn't a saint, savior, or paragon. My favorite sections in this one are those between Drizzt and his father Zaknafein (these names are like bad scramble hands-thanks mst3k) Zak like his son is cursed with morals in an immoral society. He is stuck in a life he hates. Lashing out the only way he can. In many ways reading this today ten years, or so, older I found his plight more interesting than young Drizzt's.So yes, I still loved it. It won't stack up well against your Martin, Erikson, Abercrombie, Kay...but they aren't meant to.I recommend to any open minded fan of fantasy who wants a fun quick book.
