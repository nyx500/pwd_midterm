I'll admit it.I went into this expecting a book like Dragons of Autumn Twilight. An interesting world, flat characters and cheesy dialogue.I was not expecting how dark it was.The drow are the survivors, and this is the Under-dark, the valley of death - the land of nameless nightmares.In Menzoberranzan anything goes as long as you aren't caught. Into this society, Drizzt Do'Urden is born, a drow with rare violet eyes and a conscience. He must struggle to come to terms with a society that will do anything to appease a violent and bloodthirsty Spider Queen, and hopefully keep his integrity.I think the thing that I enjoyed the most was the world building. Salvatore paints a bleak picture but a lot of the settings were painted much better than was done in Dragons. I also did enjoy getting to know Zak and Drizzt two of my favorite characters.Some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy, but I think the world building more than made up for that.I am definitely a fan.
