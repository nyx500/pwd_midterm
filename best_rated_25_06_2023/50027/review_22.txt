I haven't fallen seriously behind on my reviews, so I wanted to take some time to catch up. Homeland was a fun book and a great introduction to Drizzt and the dark world he inhabits. I think the narrative felt a little dated, but that's probably because it is. Even still, I like Drizzt a lot. I loved his complex relationship with Zaknafein, and I *hated* their inability to communicate effectively. I've never been a fan of the miscommunication trope, but it worked here.I was told time and time again to give R A Salvatore a chance, and I was not disappointed. I look forward to continuing the series (albeit at a leisurely pace).
