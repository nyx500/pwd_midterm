*** 4.44 ***I enjoyed it better the second time around... Maybe it is emotional judgement, but today, this book is as close to 4.5 as I can get (✿ ♡‿♡)*** 3.65 ***A buddy read with the wonderful folks at FBR Group!Now this is a series which I have been planning on reading for decades and even I have no idea why I kept putting it off until now... I own most of the books and kept buying them every time I ran across one or another in used book shops or Amazon sales, so I am very prepared to read all of them, as long as there is time and it is in G-d's plans... This is the beginning of the Legend of Drizzt, but I think it is sixth or seventh in the order of Forgotten Realms. Hopefully by the time I am done I will be able to have read every one of the books in this vast Universe. Since the books came after the Role Playing Game, I did not expect too much in the way of "literature" in this book, but I actually was pleasantly surprised. No, not that this is in any way high prose and immense literally value, but it was well enough written to allow us to grasp the nature of the world, begin caring about what happens with Drizzt and convey some intense action sequences on several occasions, so yeah, it was very entertaining. "... “They live with the belief that anything is acceptable if you can get away with it, that self-gratification is the most important aspect of existence, and that power comes only to she or he who is strong enough and cunning enough to snatch it from the failing hands of those who no longer deserve it. Compassion has no place in Menzoberranzan, and yet it is compassion, not fear, that brings harmony to most races. It is harmony, working toward shared goals, that precedes greatness.” ..."In the Underdark, "the secret world beneath the bustling surface of the Forgotten Realms", morals are everything that we see as immoral, and smart means cunning, while dog-eats-dog is the way of everyday life. In one of the Underdark caverns is the settlement of Menzoberranzan, where Dark Elves calling themselves Drow, have lived for generations. In their lore, the surface walking Light Elves had committed atrocities against the Drow and run them under the ground, where they have lived and worshiped the Spider Queen, their deity of chaos Lolth. Their society is matriarchal and family ties only matter as long as one can bring something of value to the family, which is closer to the meaning of the way the Mafia interprets it. "... “Ascension to power in drow society is a simple process of assassination. The Spider Queen is a deity of chaos, and she and her high priestesses, the true rulers of the drow world, do not look with ill favor upon ambitious individuals wielding poisoned daggers.” ..."In this dark and vicious world is born our hero, a drow named Drizzt Do'Urden, the third son of a matriarch who was very willing to sacrifice him to the goddess for taking down successfully a rival house and advancing in the overall hierarchy. From the first there is something odd about him, being born with violet eyes and thought blind by his relatives, which would have been a good enough reason to kill him right then and there. However, his first brother gets conveniently killed and this spares his life, putting him in the care of one of his sisters for the first 10 years. The boy shows smarts and eagerness, which are not necessarily good features in a male, the way this community is set up. So he gets as much or more beatings and "discipline" by the older sisters before being given under the tutelage of Zaknafei, the weapon master of house Do'Urden and Drizzt biological father. He turns out to be a very gifted sward master and from the age of 15 to about 30 is given into the military Academy, where he proves to be as good as his promise. But this is the place where he is finally introduced to the truth of his people and discovers that he doesn't really belong in this bloodthirsty lot. "... ““What place is this,” Drizzt asked the cat quietly, “that I call home? These are my people, by skin and by heritage, but I am no kin to them. They are lost and ever will be. “How many others are like me, I wonder?” Drizzt whispered, taking one final look. “Doomed souls, as was Zaknafein, poor Zak. I do this for him, Guenhwyvar; I leave as he could not, His life has been my lesion, a dark scroll etched by the heavy price exacted by Matron Malice’s evil promises. “Goodbye, Zack!” he cried, his voice rising in final defiance. “My father. Take heart, as do I, that when we meet again, in a life after this, it will surely not be in the hellfire our kin are doomed to endure.” ..."So, the book does tend to tell us more than show us as far as characters and emotions are concerned, but when it comes to the action, it does a really good job, kept me on the edge of my seat during every battle and duel. It is the story of the odd man out and it would have probably been much more impactful if I had read it at the time it was published, but I am glad I finally dived into this world. A fast and easy read, appropriate for all ages and good for those just coming into Fantasy. I am looking forward to the next adventure... Now I wish you all Happy Reading and may you always find what you need in the pages of a Good Book!!!
