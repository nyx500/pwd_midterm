I adored this book and would put it in the league of Under Heaven and River of Stars, all three fantastic (and slightly fantastical) quasi-historical fictions that took really world events and tweaked them just a bit. They were all gorgeously written and populated with subtle and nuanced characters, caught in the great events of their times and doing what little they could to protect themselves and their loved ones form those events.In the case of The Lions of Al-Rassan Kay brings us to an alternative take on the Reconquista, with familiar nations and lands that Kay has adjusted to provide the reader with a unique yet recognizable world. While it is obvious that the events take place in Kay's version of Iberia he does such a magnificent job of creating unique adjustments to the major players (Christian, Jews, Muslims, the Church, etc) that a fresh and compelling story springs forth.And not just a compelling story but compelling and vibrant characters. Like his past historical fictions (emphasis on the fictions) he was able to tell the story through the eyes of multiple characters. these character's perspectives and narratives are influenced by their upbringing and circumstances. Kay gives this characters depth and nuance one would expect from a flesh and blood human, they serve their own needs and agendas, not the story's needs. Kay's writing really made me connect on an emotional level with them and I was moved by the tragedies and triumphs they achieved.I really can't say enough about how excellent this book was. It had action, adventure, tragedy, beauty, politics, and sorrow all wrapped into one epic story with beautiful prose and sympathetic characters.
