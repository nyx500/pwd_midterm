The things some people can do with words are breathtaking. I absolutely loved this book. I have ranted about it to everyone possible, including strangers in cars next to me on the street. I tell them to roll down their windows and then I tell them to read this book. My mom stopped taking my calls because instead of happy mother's day, I quoted lines from this book when I talked to her. There are a lot of reviews for this so I'm not breaking any new ground here, but sincerely, if you have not read this book and you enjoy reading in any way, pick it up and start immediately. I'm afraid that might even be too late. Five-fireworks exploding in my head for the final eighty pages- stars and the placement of high expectations on a serious love affair with this guy's other works.
