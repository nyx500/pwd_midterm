"For this scribe has read a great many of these accounts and taken away another lesson : that to be a woman is to have your story misremembered. Discarded. Twisted."There's a particular kind of anxiety that comes with reading a new book from a favorite author, and I'm so happy to announce that The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi was everything I hoped it would be, and more : ✔ an exciting adventure filled with badass women, friendship, pirates, weird magical creatures, a doomed quest, dark magic and an ex-crusader as a villain 🙌 ✔ a wonderful cast of diverse characters, including : ▪ Amina, of course, the greatest pirate of all times who is now 40 and a mum however and would like her knee to stop hurting, thank you very much ; ▪ Dalila, master of poisons who could kill you in a second but—no. she absolutely will, sorry ; ▪ Majed, a middle-aged cartographer who never quite abandoned his dreams of discovering the world ; ▪ Tinbu, a loyal sailor who hand-feeds his cat ; ▪ the aforementioned "I remain entranced by its inability to provide for itself" most precious cat ; ▪ a [redacted] husband 👀 ; ▪ a snarky scribe.✔ Medieval Indian Ocean settings!!! A note about religion : so often in Fantasy, when authors take inspiration from a real, historical setting, they strip it of religion (or make every MC Christian, because of course 🙄), and I really dislike that. Not because I'm particularly religious—I'm not at all— but because religion was an inherent part of society, informing culture and traditions, and to remove it often weakens the richness of the world-building. I'm really happy it wasn't the case here (most characters are Muslims ; other religions are mentioned) ; ✔ A+ storytelling with compelling writing and such a witty and heartfelt (not to mention feminist) voice!! I LOVE ITI am so, so delighted I got to experience this fantastic story and the sequel is now one of my most anticipated release. "Amina's story did not end. [...] For when Amina chose to leave her home and return to a life at sea, she became more than a pirate. More than a witch.She became a legend."FINAL RATING : 5⭐, highly recommendedThanks so much to @harpervoyager_uk and @netgalley for the review copy!!!!
