Shannon Chakraborty does it again! She can do no wrong at this point. I loved this. Not as much as the Daevabad Trilogy, but I'm so excited to get more from this world and from Amina because she was fantastic. I'd follow her anywhere - although my seasickness might be an issue, but we'd figure it out!
