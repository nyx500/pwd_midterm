I was first introduced to Shannon's work through The City of Brass series, for which I am due a reread. Not a spoiler, but you won't have to look far to see a bit of overlap between the series. The premise had everything I wanted in a fantasy novel. A sexually liberated Muslim pirate that captains her own ship? And accidentally marries a demon? Say less.However, heist books often lose me, and this is above all, a heist. Don't you Six of Crows me. Amina is hired by a woman who claims her granddaughter has been kidnapped by a Frank. Are these Germans? I'm not good with this time period. It doesn't matter.Lo and behold, the granddaughter isn't quite a runaway. But the bad white man is bad. There are some mystical treasures to behold. And demon sex! But even that couldn't captivate me further. I will say beyond the positive Muslim rep, there is also equally positive gender affirming rep. Traditionalists won't love it, but I'm not here for their negativity.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher.
