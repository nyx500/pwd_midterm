if you’re wondering how I’m doing, just know that I finished this lying on the kitchen floor at one in the morning in a puddle of tears :)—☆—there is something incredibly bittersweet about reaching the end of a series, knowing that every page turned is one step closer to the end of an era, knowing you’ll have to let a whole world slip through your fingers at last, relinquishing your hold on beloved characters. although i only started this series in 2020, much later than many fans of the series, my anticipation for A Sky Beyond the Storm was through the roof. but to be completely honest? i was also fucking terrified.thank god for Sabaa Tahir because she pulled through. i don’t have anything eloquent to say, all i can offer is a heart full of adoration. thank you for giving so many of us characters to cherish and a world full of wonder. for giving so many of us a home. chef’s fucking kiss. 4.5 ☆
