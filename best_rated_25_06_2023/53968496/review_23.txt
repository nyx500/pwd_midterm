PERFECTION!!! *chef’s kiss*THIS IS MY NUMBER ONE BOOK OF 2021!!!Y’all! I’m speechless right now!! I just... I mean... This book blew my mind so much that I can’t even have a complete thought! The best way I can describe whatI’m feeling right now is... it’s like I was starving and then I ate a gourmet meal and now I just feel complete. Pure bliss. Okay, that might make me a fatty for describing it like that but I love food and that’s the best way I could describe it lol. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️This will be one of those books that you wish you could read for the first time over and over again. ❤️
