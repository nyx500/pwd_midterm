My April FairyLoot. Click on the spoiler after the picture to see the goodies 1. We have an awesome tote back inspired by Blood and Ash 2. Some bookends inspired by Lord of the Rings - I might get rid of these and a few other metal bookends I’ve kept. 3. Next is handmade soap inspired by The Flame in the Mist (which I’ll get rid of) and a pin inspired by the Daevabad Trilogy 4. Beautiful freaking artwork, bookmarks and tarot cards. The set of foiled bookmarks are inspired by The Poppy War, Blood Heir and An Ember in the Ashes 5. And finally we have the book with all kinds of prettiness which you know means I probably won’t like itI really loved the characters, but I just didn’t love the book enough to give it more than 3 stars. So, I’m trading this one in, but I will read the next book to see what happens. Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
