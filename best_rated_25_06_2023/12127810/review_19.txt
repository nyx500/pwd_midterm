2nd read:3.5 stars ⭐️1st read:This book was bloody amazing! Can't believe that sooo many things can happen in just one book! I thought my love for these characters (except for Jason and Piper) couldn't get any bigger, but I have been proven wrong. I LOVE ALL OF THEM (WITH EXCEPTIONS) SO MUCH I THINK MY HEART MIGHT BURST. Can't wait to read the next and final book in the Heroes of Olympus series I am going to DIE
