I've finished House of Hades!!!First of, let me tell you that the dedication page is CRAZY! It's like Rick derives pleasure from seeing us in pain....I mean seriously? Do you have to rub it in? Argggh!!! Sigh. But let's face it. We still love Rick Riordan no matter how troll he is.Anyway, on to the book.Rick stepped up his game in the House of Hades. It wasn't all action, wherein there is one explosive thing then the scene shifts to another one. In the HOH, there are quiet moments where Rick lets his character grow and have more depth. During these moments the readers could know what kind of person a character truly is and I personally enjoyed these moments. Now I know what Jason really feels about being the golden boy. That he does not feel that perfect contrary to what the others perceive about him. I wasn't expecting it but I really liked Jason's chapters. He tries hard to build a rapport with his colleagues but unfortunately, he doesn't have the skills of Percy Jackson. I can see why others don't trust him that much. Jason is supposed to be looked up to because he's the leader, being the son of Jupiter and all. But can I share my problems with him?Can he be a friend and not just a ruler who only thinks for the good of the quest? Percy is a people person. Jason -- not so much. But hey, props to Jason for trying! Now I know that he can be a good friend. Also, I love that Jason and Percy are bros. (When he bear hugged Percy? Bromance overload!!!)Piper was much much less annoying this time. Maybe because she got only four chapters which is very fine with me lol. Piper is okay when she's not obsessing about Jason. She's actually pretty cool and kick ass, her charm being her most effective weapon. Leo... I really wished that his romance with Calypso will be permanent. I mean it's about time he gets someone, a living creature, to love and will love him in return, not just his machines. Otherwise, that would be extremely lonely. He kind of matured in this book, no longer that silly, crazy demigod we all adored. Oh well, thats character development.Also, I like the Leo- Hazel friendship without the tension. Or maybe I just can't imagine Hazel being with anyone but Frank?Hazel's powers have grown here. She learned how to use the mist and bend it to suit her needs, that's pretty much impressive. I like her new friendship with Leo, and her relationship with Frank became more stable. She bonded well with Piper too. I just wish that Nico would stop the self pity and realize that of all people, Hazel would accept him for who he is!! Anyway, Hazel has a huge part in finding the doors of death and can I just say that she really rocked (figuratively) the underground realm? It's like everything is possible when Hazel is in underground, she can even sort of teleport Leo, Percy and Annabeth! Anyway, I hope the whole we're-quite-scared-of-you-because-you're-a-child-of-pluto-and-youre-super-powerful business will stop. I mean, it's really not fair.What's with the voices inside Frank's head? I still quite dont get it but okay.. Ares is just a troublesome, childish war god. End of story.I do like the fact that Ares is generous with giving his 'blessing' to his children. Remember when Clarisse killed the drakon and had a red aura around her or something? Yea, that happened to Frank too. But Frank has gotten some bonus points. His appearance changed! He became taller and less pudgy. In short, he became hot lol. and I think his promotion is right too since out of all the Romans among the seven, Frank is most roman of all. Heck, he even pins his centurion badge with everything he wears!Percy and Annabeth. Oh my heart is soooooo happy for these two.They've come so far! I really can't imagine one without the other. I think Annabeth was spot on:“Her voice caught on the word friend. Percy was a lot more than that. Even boyfriend really didn’t cover it. They’d been through so much together, at this point Percy was part of her – a sometimes annoying part, sure, but definitely a part she could not live without.”- Excerpt From: Rick, Riordan. “The House of Hades (Heroes of Olympus Book 4).”Sigh. Their journey through Tartarus was one helluva ride. It's their darkest adventure yet, and I think they wouldn't have survived if not for Bob. Maybe Damasen too but mostly it's Bob who had been their rock.I don't know. For me the highlight of their trip to Tartarus is learning to give chance and to trust that even enemies could be great allies. Also by treating someone as a friend, even if it would be insane to do so, he would also treat you as a friend and will choose to be on your side even if it means betraying traditions. Wow. Since when did Rick Riordan's books make me so philosophical? Maybe it's just too much Annabeth. Not that I'm complaining.okay, Nico is not part of the 7 but im going to include a separate portion of my review for him. WARNING: The following might contain strong emotional outbursts.NICO was angry and miserable like I mentioned. Nico is freaking fourteen!!! he shouldn't be feeling these kinds of stuff. It will break him. I wish he would be given a friend who could understand him and give him advice. Then he will make up with Percy accepting the fact that hes just an older brother or something. Then he'll go somewhere to heal his broken heart while doing some important godly job. That would be awesome.And the scene when Annabeth held Percy's hand while saying good luck to nico? That moment, i wanted to snatch Percy's hand from Annabeth and give her my 'Don't-you-have-a-heart-glare'. Oh nico...Well not everything about Nico is pure drama. There was a scene when Nico was so cute I wanted to bring him home lol. When he was turned to a corn plant and when he returned to human and he said that he had a nightmare about popcorn? That was hilarious! I hope he had more scenes like that.So that's it. I LOVED IT. It may not be the same as the past series (PJO), not that silly and juvenile, but the characters became more real to me. Goods job Mr. Rick Riordan, as usual.Now book five Blood of Olympus. Wow that sounds scary, please please come a little faster? At least make it on the first week of October!!! I know the ending of the House of Hades (which I loved btw) isn't much of a cliffhanger, but I still want to know badly what will happen. ESPECIALLY ABOUT NICO!!!  He's the most angry and miserable character I've ever met, Akhlys and he would make a fantastic, albeit desperate, pair. I want Nico to have a peace of mind, he deserves it. Please Nico stop being angry and let people love you because believe me, a lot of us fangirls really really have a massive crush on you.Oh my gosh this is such a good book!!! I hope Rick would write another Percy series after the Heroes of Olympus. I'm not ready to let Percy go.EarlierUPDATE!Oct 3, 2013:Look at this! http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by... ALL OF THE SEVEN are getting a POV in the House of Hades?I did NOT expect that, but YAY!!!But is my understanding of what he said correct?Sorry, I'm a little giddy I can't think straight lol.THE COVER:Percy and Annabeth are on the cover.Percy and Annabeth are on the cover.Percy and Annabeth are on the cover.It only means one thing. We'll be getting a POV from either of them!I'm guessing it would be Annabeth's.But oh dear, they don't look good in the picture. They look so beat up. But at least they are together. Together. Gosh that should be their.. um, tagline? Or slogan or whatever. I AM FREAKING EXCITED!EARLIER:I have a feeling we won't see Percy and Annabeth in this book. If it's possible, we will see them on the last chapters already. *sobs*(I have to qualify this. I think we won't see Percy and Annabeth's POVs here. We can only know what's happening to them thru demigod dreams and visions whatnot. I know, I know. This is unacceptable! Maybe Annabeth's POV will be included too? Since her POV was not included in TLH or SoN.)NEWSFLASH! I just read Riordan's blog and he wrote this:The one thing I can promise regarding The House of Hades ***SPOILER ALERT**** At the end of Mark of Athena, Nico senses that Percy and Annabeth are still alive, despite the incredible danger they are in. Nico is right. They are alive. You WILL find out what is happening to them in the next book. They don't disappear from the story. **** END SPOILER ALERT*****THAT'S FREAKING AWESOME GUYS!!!Whose POV we will be seeing? I think House of Hades would be told from Jason, Frank and Hazel's POV. Meh. I mean, I like Hazel and Frank with Leo joining the mix but Jason? No. I don't like him that much. Maybe I was influenced by Piper's POV on MoA, she being obsessed with Jason, as usual. Through Piper's eyes we saw Jason as too perfect. Um.. WHO WANTS PERFECT? Perfect is boring and not really believable, I mean there's a reason why most people root for the underdog right?Also she compared Jason to Percy, and I din't like her comparison. She thought Percy was unimpressive compared to Jason.At least I won't be seeing Piper's thoughts in this one. That's definitely a plus. Jasper fans, no hatin' please :DI just wish the love story won't be the main plot, it's too cuddly for my taste. LOL.  Oh well, another year of waiting for the House of Hades. Until then, I should read MoA again and savor Percy and Annabeth's moments together. I won't be seeing them for a long time.
