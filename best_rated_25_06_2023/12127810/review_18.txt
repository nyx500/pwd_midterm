****SPOILER ALERTS!!***DO NOT read unless you have read the House of Hades at least once!--------------------------------------------------Amazing is an understatement.Even the Lightning Thief is not that great compared to this.On a scale of 1-5 stars, it deserves a 20.When a reader writes a Fan-fiction, he/she writes what they want to happen in the book. They may not think so, but they do. I mean, who would get a chance to change the future and change it for the worse? This book was like a Fan-fiction. Everything I wanted to happen...happened. Percabeth POV's. Leo finding someone. Piper realizing that "the world must fall" means "Gaea must fall"...and much more. Rick Riordan, if you're listening, thank you very much for not leaving us at another Rickhanger.Oh, and Leoâ€”thank you thank you THANK YOU for throwing a screwdriver at the up button. ;)
