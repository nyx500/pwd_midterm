Nerve wreaking and full of adrenaline rush. This one is my favourite from the Kane Chronicles Series. Love triangles are one of my pet peeves but I liked it in this one. At some point the book became quite predictable though. Walt hosting Anubis, I saw that one coming already. There was no character development in the series . It is a good treat for Rick Riordan fans.
