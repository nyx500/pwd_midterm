Soo, I'm really glad to say that this was the best book of the series :)). It really impressed me. I wasn't expecting at very much since the first two book weren't at that "Rick level". But this was veery good. And... like I said it before, Walt Stone is officially my favorite character :).After all, the book was a good read and the plot was really nice. I never expected Bes to come back!! Never! But it was cool. It was pretty predictable that Walt was going to "become" Anubis but it's ok. Of course the "little love" stories and dramas that took part through the book were great. I will never compare the Kane Chronicles with PJO because I can't. Those are FAR better. Anyway, that's what I think. Still 5 stars, just because of the Riordan magic :)))Happy New Year everyone!
