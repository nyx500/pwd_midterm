Congratulations to M.L Wang - The Sword of Kaigen is the SPFBO champion for 2019 with the joint-highest score in the contest's 5 year history (from ~1,500 books!)Find out more here:https://mark---lawrence.blogspot.com/...Well, this was excellent. My favourite SPFBO champion so far.Wang is a highly skilled writer with a talent for bringing her characters to life, making them feel vital, unique, real. She very quickly invested me in the lives of the families around which this story revolves.It takes a while to understand what this story is about as it's set in a large, complex world and often I felt that we were going to follow those threads into some larger, world-threatening plot. But really this is a story concerned with the Matsuda family and the young woman who marries into it.There's an interesting magic system and an enjoyable mix of these magics and modern science set against the background of a very traditional society into which almost no technology intrudes. The battles (and Wang writes wonderful fight scenes) are based around swords and magic (primarily ice-magic).Wang's unashamedly ruthless - all of the characters are in danger, nobody is safe. There's a LOT of heartache waiting for you among these pages, along with tons of excitement, intrigue, and satisfaction.A lot of frustration and tension is generated by the constraints of the society imposed on characters who we want to have the freedom to flourish / be happy, and by the failure of characters to communicate - but not in any artificial way but because people are complex and flawed and often fail to understand each other's motives and feelings.It's a mature book in the way that it presents, understands, and resolves various conflicts, showing every one on whom the spotlight lingers to be deeply human. There are no mustache twirling villains here.Wang maintains the pace, tension, and interest extremely well, hauling the reader through this lengthy book.Only in the early stages when the focus moves to a new location did I worry that I wasn't going to fully enjoy the book, and those fears were short-lived.This book pleased me on all levels and I give it my highest recommendation.
