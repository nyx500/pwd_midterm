There is something indescribably beautiful about The Sword of Kaigen. I loved the writing—the simplicity of its prose, sharpened into something so piercingly poignant. Sadness and anger, hurt and frustration stream through the pages of the novel—vibrant shades and subtle hues of feelings that wash and sweep over you, the colours diffusing into your soul.And at the heart of this novel was Misaki. Her character was so real, woven together from the threads of longing, loneliness and regret. She was a mother, wife and daughter—someone who struggled to reconcile her desires against the ideals of those who sought to define her. She was a shattered mirror of herself, the pieces waiting to be put together into something wholly beautiful. Silhouetted against the jagged backdrop of war, The Sword of Kaigen was nothing short of harrowing, a story filled with visceral insights and sombre reflections. And as the saying goes—people don't win wars; they survive it.4.0/5note: thanks to petrik for recommending this! there are many, many things this novel does right that i haven't written about in this review, but there's very few left for me to say that other readers haven't said already. all i have to say here is that you should be reading this!
