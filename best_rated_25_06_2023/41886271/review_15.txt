"You lost your right to my obedience when you stopped being a man!"PUT THIS QUOTE ON MY TOMBSTONE.I loved this. It is such a well done novel. We got character development and history and political maneuvering and government conspiracies and magic and so much more all in a standalone? Who thought it could be done? Not me.I have to drop it down a star though for Takeru. It's ON SIGHT with this 'man'. I hate him. Truly and deeply. What a spineless waste of space. Do I sound harsh? Good. He deserves so much worse. Don't talk to me about a redemption arc. That only made it worse. Mizaki is a queen and she deserves so much better.
