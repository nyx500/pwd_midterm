This Review ✍️ Blog 📖 Twitter 🐦 Instagram 📷“You learn over time that the world isn’t broken. It’s just… got more pieces to it than you thought. They all fit together, just maybe not the way you pictured when you were young.”★ I have to agree with the quote above, the pieces of this book fit together perfectly! You can’t understand the crazy expectations I had for this book and yet it was able to blow me away! I have some bold confessions: Best Self-published book I ever read, Best Fantasy Standalone I ever read and one of the best books I read this year! (Okay I made them in bold and then realized it became a bad pun for the previous sentence!)★ I don’t know where to start with this one, it was just perfect in all aspects as if it was written and tailored to my taste! But I love that almost everyone who read it gave it 5 stars (4 if not 5) and I have to agree with my friend Petrik that it is a master piece.★ The writing was so good, it was so atmospherical and I felt that I was part of that word. There were a lot of quotes I like and the book uses dialogues to touch upon very important, very sensitive subjects! It took me a few pages to get used to the Japanese terms and the glossary surely helped! But after those few pages that I invested some time in, it was like winning the million-dollar lottery! The book is unputdownable! I am writing this and I am suddenly in the mood to reread it soon!★ The characters are some of the best characters I read at all! They were so well written and so fleshed out, I could relate to them and I loved them and I mourned them and I can’t stop thinking about them. I think the author was smart because the book had 2 POVs, one of the characters was a young kid and the other was his mother and I am assuring you that this worked a 1000% positively for the book. But the great thing about the characters is that I even cared about the secondary ones and I can still picture them all in the village in my mind!“A life of dangerous adventures might seem worth it now, when you are young and seemingly invincible, but one day, you will have children, and you will not want that life for them.”★ The world-building is amazing, I saw many people comparing this to Avatar the air binder and I can see why given the magic system but I also think it is not a fair comparison because this was a bit more mature due to delving into the war and the tragedies it entails. But if you love Avatar, then I am pretty sure you will love this one.★ The Plot is just so clever and so well thought! the synopsis sounds good but the book is actually better! This book has lots of action, and I like to think of it as 3 thirds, the first third is an introduction and setting the world and preparation for everything. The second third is where most of the action and War take place and it may be my fav action scenes in all the books I ever read. The last third is like an epilogue but at the same time it had a scene I really dreamt of having in the book and I was so happy it was there in this part. The pacing was so well done that I was glued to the book the whole time!★ I also loved how the book discussed very important things without feeling it tried so hard to do so, or without feeling like there were checkboxes it needed to have! The author genuinely approaches topics such as family and martial arts and feminism and racism! The thing that still blows my mind is that she did this by herself, It was better than 90% of the traditionally published books I have read so Wang just raised the bar of self-publishing and she just destroyed the stereotype that self-published books are bad! The book even had its maps, glossary, characters list, and chapter header!“I’ve never needed a sword to protect you—to raise you the way your father wanted. Caring for my family meant putting away the fighter, so I did.”★ Summary and Prescription: If you are a fantasy fan then do yourself a favor and read this book!!!!!!!Petrik picked this as his book for my 10 bloggers, 10 recommendations challenge! Thanks a million Petrik!!You can get more books from Book Depository
