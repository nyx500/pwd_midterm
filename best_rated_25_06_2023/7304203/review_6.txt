Well after that marathon reading session I am exhausted.Started the first book about a week ago and could not stop. It was intriguing. I loved it and I usually do not read fantasy, paranormal, call it what you will. ”Bloody hell, Ms Lane, you drive me bloody fucking crazy.”I THOUGHT I’D LOST EVERYTHING.HOW IGNORANT I WAS.HE WARNED ME.I HAD SO MUCH MORE TO LOSE.I WANT TO DIE.This review will be mostly visual“Some people bring out the worst in you, others bring out the best, and then there are those remarkably rare, addictive ones who just bring out the most. Of everything.They make you feel so alive that you'd follow them straight into hell, just to keep getting your fix.”It was great that it was set in Ireland and even set in places very near to where I grew up in the West of Irealnd.“The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were trouble.""Ditto.""I wanted to drag you between the shelves, fuck you senseless, and send you home.""If you'd done that, I never would have left.""You're still here anyway.""You don't have to sound so sour about it.""You're upsetting my entire existence.""Fine, I'll leave.""Try and I'll chain you up.” ”You mind-fuck with me again, I’ll fuck you back. But it won’t be with my mind.”I LOVED Jericho Barrons, yes Irene, you were right.I LOVED Barrons and Mac together eventhough I felt they were not together enoughMACSeelies/Unseelies/FaesIf you are looking for a book with hot, erotic sex scenes …. Well …All the men in the book were droolworthy, definitely don’t see men like that when I go back to Ireland on holidays I felt like crying. The day I set foot in the Emereld Isle, the slow erosion of me had begunV’lane“I didn’t ask. Some things are better left unsaid.He looked at me and I shivered. I never get enough of him. Never will.He lives.I breathe.I want. Him. Always.Fire to my ice. Ice to my fever.Later we would go to bed, and when he rose over me, dark and vast and eternal, I’d know joy.”ROWENARYODAN... maybe not ALL the men are drool-worthy!DARROC ”Why does it always take you so long to tell me the important things?”DANII LOVED DANI, WITH HER FECKING FECKERS!“Love knows no right or wrong. Love is. Only is.” THERE WERE WORSE WAYS TO BE TORTURED THAN WITH A VISION OF JERICHO BARRONS NAKED You’re leaving me, Rainbow Girl ...The first part and the last part of the book were exciting, did not know what to expect, I felt it was just a tad bit drawn out in the middle but the author is a suckler for detail so I suppose she had to include EVERYTHING  LIKE A MOTH TO A FLAME, I FOLLOWED Keep your friends close … and your enemies closerWill I give fantasy/paranormal another shot? Well, I think I am signed up for a BR of the BDB on Monday so the answer is YESYes, I will admit throughout most of this series I was …so I think I have to go find me a nice little hot book now!
