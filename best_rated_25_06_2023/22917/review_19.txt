Grimms Märchen – Grimm’s Fairy TalesWilhelm & Jakob Grimm (1785-1863)This work could be called „The Bible of German Fairy Tales”.It contains over two hundred stories: Der Froschkönig, Dornröschen, Hansel & Gretel, Das tapfere Schneiderlein, Der Wolf und die Sieben Geisslein, Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten, Frau Holle, Rapunzel, Rumpelstilzchen, Schneewitchen, Rotkäppchen, Tischlein deck dich, Goldesel und Knüppel Aus dem Sack;These are the ones every reader will recognize at once. Some have become famous around the World and made the fortune of Walt Disney. Many turned into movies.The tales are simple but contain essential human behavior, qualities, and failures, courage, and cowardice, loyalty and betrayal, Crime and Punishment, to quote Dostoyevsky.The prose style is surprisingly plain and transparent. However, after getting used to it, we are left with a soothing melancholy. In the end, even a little sadness, remembering the awes and wide-eyed childhood mysteries of the Christmas tree and little bells ringing out in the distance.Here is an easy recipe for fairy tales:We take the following ingredients:A poor farmer and his wife,A little girl, or two, two or three brothers growing up and yearning to see the world;An enormous dark and haunted forest; An ugly old witch in her haunted little dwelling;A beautiful and kind fairy watching over little children,The rugged high mountain and the castle;An old King and beautiful children, a princess and a prince;A frog, a duck, some geese, a cock and a hen, some turtle doves, a dog, some pigs, a donkey, a horse, slippery snakes, and a fire-spitting dragon.For spices, we need some sweetness and some bitterness, some tears and some smiling, some fights and huggings, some wounds and healing, some witchcraft and miracles, some sadness and happiness, plenty of food and drinks and some gold and silver as well.We write all these words on a piece of paper, we cut them out fold them up and pour them in a bowl and mix them well.Then we pick the words out one by one, place them randomly on a large white paper and fill the space in between with our imagination.There we are, ready with a new story for bedtime.Moreover, at his time I would like to wish all my reader friends Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
