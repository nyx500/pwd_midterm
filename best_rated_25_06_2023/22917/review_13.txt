I tried. I tried so hard to read this book.I kept telling myself that I can do it. That they're all old fairy tales. That it's nice to know the origin of all those classic stories.But no. I just... I really can't do it anymore.They're all ridiculous, annoying, and so so so much boring.DNF (I'm not sorry)
