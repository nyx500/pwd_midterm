I'm resigned to feeling differently about my childhood favourites now. I do realize that what I've read when I was young were either edited or abridged versions. And regarding Grimm's Fairy Tales, I think what I've read before is only a collection of fairy tales, which is heavily edited and rewritten, and not the complete compilation. I would have been in for a shock, had I not known the history pertaining to these writings. The knowledge that they weren't originally intended as children's tales and that it was only an attempt to study and preserve German folklore by the Grimm brothers helped me overlook certain prejudices and cruelties that filled many of these tales. My rating here is the overall average of 210 tales which I rated separately. It shows that many of the tales have been ordinary. There were only a small number of original stories and many were repetitions. Some had no meaning as stories and were boring to death. I only enjoyed about a quarter of the tales, and those were the popular ones. While reading this complete edition, I also read a few from the first volume of the original tales written by the Grimm brothers, and I must say that I liked the direct and somewhat unpolished tales more than the later rewritten refined ones. I have a mind to read the whole volume sometime later, for I feel I'll enjoy it more. Frankly, I enjoyed only about a quarter of the tales out of this complete collection. But I'm not disappointed. Those I enjoyed were the ones truly etched in my memory from childhood. It was nice revisiting them, for they certainly took me years back to the happier days.
