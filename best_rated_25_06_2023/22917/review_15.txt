This was a chore to read, I thought it would be brilliant and dark. Sadly, it was anything but, there was the odd moment of slight creepiness but that was about it. Out of the two hundred or so stories, there were only a few that stood out â€” the rest were all repetitive, it felt like I was reading the same story over and over. I was getting sick of the same themes, characterizations and dynamics used. The message throughout was that:-All stepmothers are bitter, jealous, evil, immoral, lazy and greedy. -Stepdaughters are always treated badly by their stepmothers and stepdaughters are always beautiful, and humble and good.-All ugly people are evil, only beautiful people are good. -Ugly people are cool with murder.-Insta-love will happen as long as the people involved are beautiful and/or royalty.-The youngest son who everyone thinks is dumb will always outsmart his evil older brothers and somehow become a prince/king. -Any character who does something good will be rewarded with all kinds of treasures.-Good girls have to be hard working, self-sacrificing, forgiving and humble. Otherwise they're unworthy of happiness.-Good will always conquer evil.Yea, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, the stories aren't all that interesting, reading a few is more than enough to get the gist of the Grimm's brothers fairy tales.
