Boldly ventured is half won.As always, Grimm Brothers didn't disappoint me. I enjoyed this tale more than I expected.  OVERVIEWThere is a princess who proclaims that whoever solves her riddle, she will marry him. Princess is 100% sure that nobody can solve it but a tailor solves it. In state of shock, Princess refuses to marry him and gives him another test to pass in exchange of marriage. She puts him in the cage of bear. If he stays alive all the night, princess will marry him.This tale was a fun read for me. It shows that no matter how much difficult a task is, don't be discouraged! There are many things we don't try. Because we think we can't do them. Because they seem impossible. I don't know about you guys but I feel this. Look at this tale, when the tailor was ordered to spend a night with bear, he could reject it. But he didn't. He didn't get discouraged. He tried it. And ultimately accomplished his goal by using his mind. Overall, it's great. I would recommend it.
