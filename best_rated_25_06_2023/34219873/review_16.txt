Actual rating: 4,5 starsThis was really good!If you ask me, all the hype this book got was totally justified.The novel is often compared to Harry Potter and I can see why (young chosen protagonist, villain who's name people are afraid to say out loud, magic), but still, those are two very different stories.It's rare when book compels me from the prologue, and that was what happened with Nevermoor.I lost myself in this magical world, but if I'm being honest, at times I was also lost.I ascribe that to the fact that English is not my first language, and I am still exploring fantasy. Since this is aimed to middle graders, I think it will be easy to follow to most readers, if not everyone.I loved Morrigan as a main character, but I also enjoyed reading about all of her friends.My favourite was Fenestra, the giant cat, and I wish I could have one for myself. If only one of my cats could became a magical creature similar to her (but not GiGi because he would be dangerous!).I loved The Trials of Morrigan Crow so much that I plan to visit a bookstore by the end of this week to buy myself a sequel!I highly recommend this one to all middle graders and adults who enjoyed Harry Potter, but want to read something original.
