The Trials of Morrigan Crow is one of those middle grade children's books which is still perfectly readable by adults who like fantasy. I loved it.Jessica Townsend introduces her magical world by saying little but showing lots - just the way it should be done. There's a wonderful talking cat and a hotel which creates itself according to the resident's needs and desires. There are dragons and dragon riders. There are witches and people who can perform amazing tasks. And there is much more!All of the characters are delightful especially Jupiter and Hawthorne. Morrigan Crow herself shows tremendous promise of good things to come in future books. The story is excellent and is complete in this book but with plenty of hints about what is to come.And all of this was well written, nicely paced and thoroughly enjoyable. Five stars for this first episode in the series and I look forward to much more.
