Oh my! That was *Magnificat! I mean Magnificent! I realize that the below quote is quite long... But it sets the tone of this fantastic book! Enjoy! Jupiter was gazing anxiously out the window now, a frown creasing his forehead. “You did actually sign the contract before you burned it, though,” he said without looking at her. “And who says you’re going to die? You don’t have to die if you don’t want to.” Corvus slammed his fist on the table. “This is intolerable! Who do you think you are, waltzing into my home and upsetting my family with this nonsense?” “I told you who I am.” Jupiter spoke patiently, as if to a senseless child. “My name is Jupiter North.” “And I am Corvus Crow, the state chancellor of Great Wolfacre and a ranked member of the Wintersea Party,” said Corvus, puffing up his chest. He was on a roll now. “I demand that you go at once, and allow me to mourn the death of my daughter in peace.” “Mourn the death of your daughter?” echoed Jupiter. He took two deliberate steps toward Corvus and paused, his eyes glittering. The hairs on Morrigan’s arms stood up. Jupiter’s voice dropped an entire octave, and he spoke with a cold, quiet anger that was terrible to behold. “Can you possibly mean the daughter standing right in front of you? The one who is demonstrably, superbly, brilliantly alive?” Corvus sputtered and pointed to the clock on the wall, his hand shaking with outrage. “Well, give it a few hours!” Morrigan felt something squeeze in her chest, and she wasn’t sure why. She’d always known she was going to die on Eventide. Her father and grandmother had never kept it secret. It shouldn’t have been a surprise that Corvus was so resigned to her fate, but Morrigan suddenly realized that to him, she might as well be dead already. Perhaps in his heart she’d been dead for years. “Morrigan,” said Jupiter, in a voice very different from the one he’d just used on her father, “don’t you want to live?” Morrigan flinched. What sort of a question was that? “It doesn’t matter what I want.” “It does,” he insisted. “It matters so very, very much. Right now it’s the only thing that matters.” Her eyes flicked from her father to her grandmother to her stepmother. They all watched her intently, uneasily, as if seeing her properly for the first time. “Of course I want to live,” she said quietly. It was the first time she’d ever spoken the words aloud. The tightness in her chest eased a little. “Good choice.” Jupiter smiled; the cloud disappeared from his face as quickly as it had arrived. He turned back to the window. “Death is boring. Life is much more fun. Things happen in life all the time. Unexpected things. Things you couldn’t possibly expect because they’re so very… unexpected.” He stepped backward, inching away from the window and reaching blindly for Morrigan, fumbling to take her hand. “For instance, I bet you didn’t expect your so-called death to arrive three hours early.” Morrigan felt something powdery land on her face. Wiping it away, she looked up to see the light fixtures shaking and cracks appearing in the plaster. The lightbulbs stuttered and buzzed. The windows began to rattle. There was a faint smell of burning. “What’s that?” She squeezed his hand automatically. “What’s happening?” Jupiter leaned down to whisper in her ear. “Do you trust me?” She answered without thinking. “Yes.” “You sure?” “Positive.” “All right.” He looked her in the eye. The floor trembled beneath their feet. “I’m going to take that curtain down in a moment. But whatever you see out there, you mustn’t be afraid. They can tell when you’re afraid.” Morrigan swallowed. “They?” “Just follow my lead and you’ll be fine. Yes? No fear.” “No fear,” repeated Morrigan. Meanwhile, fear had set up camp in her stomach and was having a festival. A Ferris wheel of fear spun idly in her abdomen. Dancing circus elephants of fear somersaulted through her intestinal tract. “What the devil are you talking about over there?” said Grandmother. “What’s he saying to you, Morrigan? I demand to—” In a rush of sudden movement Jupiter pulled a handful of silver dust from his pocket and blew it toward Corvus, Ivy, and Grandmother like a cloudy, starry kiss, then leapt up to the window and ripped down the curtain, dropping it in a crumpled, messy pile in the middle of the floor. He stood back to gaze at his handiwork and shook his head slowly, mournfully. “I am so sorry. How tragic to have lost her so young.” Corvus frowned and blinked, looking unsure. His eyes were glassy. “Tragic?” “Mmm,” said Jupiter. He threw an arm around Corvus’s shoulders and led him closer to the pile of fabric. “Dear, dear Morrigan. So full of life. So much to share with the world. But taken! Taken too soon.” “Too soon.” Corvus nodded in shell-shocked agreement. “Much too soon.” Jupiter put his other arm around Ivy and drew her into his chest. “You mustn’t blame yourselves. Although you could a bit, if you wanted to.” He winked at Morrigan, who felt a small, hysterical laugh working its way up out of her throat. Did they really believe that curtain was her, lying dead on the floor? She was standing right in front of them! “She looks so small.” Ivy sniffed and drew her sleeve across her nose. “So small and thin.” “Yes,” said Jupiter. “Almost as if she were… made of fabric.” Morrigan snorted, but the Crows made no sign that they’d heard her. “I’ll leave you to make the necessary arrangements. You’ll need to prepare a statement for the press, Chancellor. But before I go, may I suggest a closed casket for the funeral? Open caskets are so tacky.” “Yes,” said Grandmother, gazing down at curtain-Morrigan. “Indeed. Quite tacky.” “What did you do?” Morrigan whispered to Jupiter. “What was that silver stuff?” “Highly illegal. Pretend you didn’t see it.” The light fixture swung violently, casting shadows across the room. An unmistakable smell of woodsmoke filled the air. The floor began to shake again, and in the distance Morrigan heard something like heavy rain or rolling thunder or—was it—hoofbeats? She turned to the window and felt a hot, prickling fear all the way down her spine. Panic rose like bile in her throat. She could see it. She could see her death coming.********The audiobook edition of The Trials of Morrigan Crow is a difficult book to put into words as I loved every minute of it. Until it ended that is. 🙁So my review is brief but I think it get right down to the heart of my thoughts. In short, the dynamic combination of Jessica Townsend's unbelievably glorious debut and the phenomenal narrative performance of Gemma Whelan creates a stunning and absolutely magnificent listen! The story jumps off the pages into living color and tangible reality! The *Magnificat I mentioned is one of my favorite characters! It's a collosal rollercoaster ride full of a range of emotions that will send listeners into hours of exciting entertainment! Loaded with amusing, hilarious, and uplifting fun that made me laugh out loud along with perilous adventures that bring fear, dread, and uncertainty that gave me goosebumps. And, of course, there's the teasing cliffhanger of what will be happen next in Morrigan's future. I loved and adored this audiobook!Do give it a listen! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!When I listened to this the first two times I read book two, Wundersmith: The Calling of Morrigan Crow, as it wasn't available on audiobook. However, just a few days ago I searched again and discovered that there IS an audiobook edition AVAILABLE NOW! Even more exciting is that it is, once again, performed by Gemma Whelan! Stay tuned for my review of the second installment! I've already started listening to it even before I wrote this review! And now there will be the release of book three, Hollowpox: The Hunt for Morrigan Crow, in August, 2020. Sadly I can't find an audiobook but I'm not bothered about it as the Nevermoor/Morrigan Crow  series is an absolute favorite of mine and I'm excited to read it!
