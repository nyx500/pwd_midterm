Made for bitter people. Dangerous people, when they wanted back what never was.”... However, this was one of the most difficult on my psyche read I have ever embarked on... And I recommend it to every adult out there... !"... “Against a broken heart, even absurdity falters.Because words fall away.A dialogue of silence.That deafens.”... I finished... I feel like I have been run over by a bulldozer!!! I am emotionally exhausted and completely spent... I have no coherent thoughts at the moment... I need a drink! And some chocolate ice cream...

The book must close.We are abandoned to history.Raise high one more time the tattered standardOf the Fallen.
