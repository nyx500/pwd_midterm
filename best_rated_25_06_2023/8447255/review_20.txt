What's three and a half million words between friends? It's a long journey that has been worth every step. This is epic fantasy at it's most awe-inspiring. I knew after the first couple of books in this series that it would easily become my number one fantasy series of all time. For a long time, A Song of Ice and Fire has held that mantle. This series sweep my long-time favourite into the dust. The series had everything, epic battles, characters, locations, continents and magic system that a reader could hope for in a series.If there's one fantasy series to try in your lifetime. It's this series.
