There were three different times in the last forty pages where I was emarrassingly sobbing. Thank god I was home alone and avoided having to explain myself to people that don't read. Explaining the impact of this stunning conclusion to those that need their entertainment spoon fed to them is beyond my capacity. That may sound judgemental but I try to expalin books to friends and they look at me like I'm crazy, they just don't get it. But you guys get it, and for that I'm grateful. As others have stated sharing any favorite parts would be spoilers for earlier books so I wont go there but the bringing together of all that came before is ten to fifteen minute standing ovation worthy and maybe the satisfying in terms of how everything concluded. Ive only re-read maybe six or seven books my whole life but the complexity and flat out funness of this story demands a second go around to which I am very much looking forard to. All ten books took roughly seven months to read and every book is a step above everything else in any category IMHO.
