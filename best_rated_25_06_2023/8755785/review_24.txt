The Mortal Instruments, book No. 6 The final, longest and probably best book in the series (now that was surprise for me!), in which Sebastian, the Endarkened and demons look to wipe out not just the Shadowhunters, but the entire world! Was it worth it? From a young adult fantasy reading perspective, very much so, as Sebastian goes full barrels out to utterly destroy the Shadowhunter world forcing Clary, Jace, Isabelle, Simon, Alec, Magnus, Maia, Luke etc. to be pushed to the limits and beyond.Artwork saved by Melissa P. Duarte on PintrestA series that I began rereading for the sole purpose of discarding it and freeing up some shelf space ends up reminding me that this is a very good piece of reality building with a range of limited but interesting characters, with the overriding romantic story threads being the only downside for me, although they are played with much better effect in this final volume. A firm Three Star, 7 out of 12 for me :)And yes, I am still taking this series the local charity shop to free up 7 book spaces on my YA shelves :)2023 and 2017 read
