"No one's tried to kill me in at least two weeks."It's over! It's finally over!!! Saying this had been a painfully boring reading experience is a massive understatement. From first three MI books, then to the ID trilogy, followed by Red Scrolls of Magic and back here to the second half of MI, is not something that I ever wanted to put myself through again, with the exception of Red Scrolls.Honestly, I had very little expectations after City of Fallen Angels and only two things kept me going: to see how it'll all end and those fun parts with Isabelle and Simon. The overwhelming romance remained the main theme and the actual fantasy elements became quite minor. By the time I make it to the fifth book, I was skipping entire chapter that are only full of repetitive romance. As I'm ending this sixth and last MI book, I suddenly realized how good Cassandra Clare's writing is (no sarcasm). It is very clear, highly readable and took almost no effort in maintaining a steady flow. It also must have been a reason for perpetuating me from one book to the other despite not enjoying all the love triangles and stuff.Once again, I'm doing a common review for all three books as there's very little to separate them.
