Hmm…although I have only read the first three books of TMI, I can't possibly imagine how Cassandra Clare wrote THREE MORE DANG BOOKS!!! Did anyone else think that City of Glass wrapped everything up nicely? I did. With everyone happy. The Downworlders and Shadowhunters forgetting their pasts and mingling. Maryse being okay with Alec and Magnus (that part was so sweet. I smiled whenever they came up.) Clary and Jace together. Simon accepting his sunny-albeit bloody- fate. Happiness for all!!!!! "No," says Cassandra Clare.I guess there are some questions unanswered: Will Simon choose Maia or Isabelle?  Will Clary train to become a Shadowhunter? (well, I guess that one's pretty obvious)  Will Jocelyn marry Luke?But…with Valentine and Sebastian "dead" (ya, I seriously doubt that), the Downworlders and Shadowhunters "resolving their ancient problems that don't make any sense," and Clary and Jace "finally together," what is the plot?! Probably lots of Jace and Clary time. Yay. -__-And I know it's been said before but….2014?! SERIOUSLY! You can't do that! There's something called LOSING INTEREST and it's probably going to happen to a lot of the people who are totally spazzing out about the wait. We all loyally-or reluctantly-read the five flipping books, at least let us know the ending! Jeez.BUT PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, COHF, BE AS AWESOME AS CITY OF BONES, CITY OF ASHES AND CITY OF GLASS!!!!!!Please?
