I loved the Heralds of Valdemar in middle school. I read everything by Mercedes Lackey I could get my hands on, which was a considerable lot.Eventually I "outgrew" them, sort of. I had reread the old ones so much and the new ones didn't have the same allure. It was time for new favorites.Still, eventually nostalgia called, and I looked up my old friends to find you really can't go "home" again. Books that had made me alternately joyous and heartbroken were distressingly flat and transparently clich√©.Well, it doesn't matter, I thought. I loved the novels once, and not loving them *now* doesn't change how profoundly wonderful they were for me back then.Sometimes I notice a new Velgarth novel and wonder what is happening there, though. And I have learned that not all of my old standbys are unreadable.I liked Tarma and Kethry, but Vows and Honor and its close relatives were never my favorites. It was with some surprise I found that, for me, they best stood the test of time.Back in the day, I recall that By the Sword disappointed me a little. It was rather too prosaic; I had expected something a little different from what I got. Maybe that's why today it's one of only a few options open to me for revisiting Valdemar.Yes, Kerowyn is a supercilious know it all (well-suited, therefore, to Lackey's narration) and Eldan is not the least bit interesting. Still, the book retains some interest in its musings about ethics, its glimpses into politics, its pace, and a pinch of realism in its approach to events.No, it's no Paksenarrion in that respect, nor does it come anywhere near the "gritty realism" of succeeding decades. But add in the nostalgia factor and I am a happy reader.
