Kerowyn is the great-granddaughter of the famed sorceress Kethry, although she knows little of her own heritage. When her father is murdered and her brother grievously injured at his wedding party, there is no one left to save the bride except for Kero. Her heroic actions set her on a journey to become a mercenary, and her life will never be the same again.This was one of my absolute favorite books when I was in high school. I devoured every single book I could read about badass women wielding swords and being fighters that I could, and let's just say that in the early 2000s, there were not a whole lot of books out there (edit: there are and have always been women fantasy writers, but I'm talking specifically about the kind of books geared specifically for a young adult audience in the way the genre is structured now). Katniss Everdeen hadn't launched the YA strong female character, and Mercedes Lackey was, for me and many other teenage girls, a gateway into adult fantasy.About five or six years ago, I had intended on picking this up again to see if I still liked it, and I ended up putting it down because it was a little bit too preachy on well...just about everything.But this year I had been getting strong urges to read the books that had defined me as a teenager, that had kept me warm and whole and going on when everything was falling apart, and so I picked it up again.It was still a little on the preachy side, but overall enjoyable.My favorite parts were the training sequences, mainly because Tarma, Kethry and Warrl (okay, mostly Warrl) are my favorite characters in the Valdemar world (the Heralds are all a little much), and Warrl got to shine so much in this book with his sarcastic wit. When Kerowyn goes off into the world, the narrative became a little choppy and bounced around, as if several novellas were tacked together to create this book (they probably were). And only a couple mentions were left of Tarma and Kethry as Kerowyn got older—she name-drops the Shin'a'in a whole hell of a lot (and girl gets a whole boost up with her nomadic cousins, who literally pull her ass up out of bankruptcy and make her famous) and she also mentions her brother and his family a bunch too when she goes back to visit—which made me super nervous because I wanted closure. I wanted to know if Tarma and Kethry and Warrl finally got their rest, or if they were still happily toddling about the Tower in their old age.Anywho, because of the narrative choppiness—which goes from super detailed during Kero's training to jumping forward 5-6 years into her experience as a scout behind enemy lines to another 10 or so years as a very well established mercenary captain—a lot of my emotional connection was lost in the ultimate climax. The climax where before as a teen I was always choking up in tears because her people had me like, oh damn that could have been done a bit better.And I wanted more nuance than what I got with the Shin'a'in and talks of barbarianism, savagery and other coded terms.So as a jaded, cynical adult, much of this magic was lost on me, although I still enjoyed the book for what it was, and for what it was for me as a teenager. It was enjoyable, solid and fun, even if it had a few too many miracle coincidences for Kerowyn.
