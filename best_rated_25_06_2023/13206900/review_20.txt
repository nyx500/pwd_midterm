A bittersweet conclusion to a fantastic YA-SciFi series. The Lunar Chronicles is retelling GOLD!Winter is the fourth, and concluding novel, in Marissa Meyer's beloved Lunar Chronicles series.Coming in at over 800-pages, this hefty book provides the final stand-off between our intrepid heroes, their allies, and the wicked Lunar Queen, Levana.There was a ton of action, some of it quite brutal, and I enjoyed learning a bit more about each of our main characters.I can't believe it is over. As some of you may know, I have a difficult time continuing with series. There was no problem with this one. I was that compelled to keep moving forward.I love how Meyer built the world out. Each book, you gain more characters, more knowledge of the world and the stakes are steadily increased.In this book, our newest character, per the title, is Winter, the Lunar Princess.She was such a delight. Due to repressing the use of her glamour, her mind is a bit janky. Winter suffers from frequent hallucinations and the people in the kingdom think she is unhinged, but due to her overwhelmingly kind nature, they love her nonetheless.Again with this one, I appreciated so much the connections to the original fairy tales.As a set of retellings, I think The Lunar Chronicles is top notch. I would love to read further retellings from Meyer and definitely have boosted Heartless up my TBR.I'm extremely happy that I finally took the time to pick this series up. I was enthralled the entire way through!If you haven't read this series yet, and are a YA Sci-Fi fan, you should definitely check it out!
