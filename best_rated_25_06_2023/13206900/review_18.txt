My Reviews for this series:•Fairest•Stars Above•Cinder•Scarlet•CressThis finale to the Lunar Chronicles finds Cinder on a mission to take her rightful place on the throne of Luna, as she is the lost princess Selene.Winter faces a major pacing problem. It's over 800 pages and a lot of it is just blah blah. It reminds me of a video game with too many tedious side quests and overlong cutscenes that you can't skip through. While there's plenty of action, the meat to garnish ratio here is not filling. A good 300 pages could have been cut without the audience missing anything important.Further, I hate to say this but for a story that is so progressive about minorities and women in STEM, some of the characters are just flat. Nearly all of the men are interchangeable and it takes a second to remember them and they are mostly only important in relation to the women they are paired with. I get it if Meyer is trying to make some sort of reverse-Bechdel commentary here, but I doubt these books are supposed to have that kind of depth.You can tell the technology is advanced because each time someone uses a portscreen, they don't have to let out that sigh of frustration because they have to x out of an ad asking them to download an app when they go to a mobile site. Of course, even with adblocking apps like Crystal, this is too much of a fantasy to even hope for in our modern times.Even with all of its problems, I have to say that this cover is my favorite of the entire series:(But the whole apple thing is kinda forced here in how it's implemented, tbh.)
