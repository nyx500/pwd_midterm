Meh. That’s really all I have to say.This book is very, very long (it has tissue-paper pages! That’s how you know a YA book is too damn long). It introduces more characters I don’t care about, allowing me to realize that I really only care about Cress and Thorne. It spends a hundred thousand million years wrapping up every loose end, and still the plotline and conclusion manage to feel unsatisfying.I really don’t have much to say beyond that.The fact that this book is 827 pages long and I can’t even summon up two paragraphs about it says it all.So let’s call that my bottom line and call it a day.-----------pre-reviewthings about this book that are cute:- Cress- Thorne- Cress and Thornethings about this book that are not cute:- the fact that it is 827 PAGES LONG.review to comeee-----------currently-reading updatesuh, this book is...long-----------tbr reviewif this book doesn't break my heart and make me cry i Will demand a refund
