"Broken isn't the same as unfixable.‚ÄùA grand finale!This had everything I'm looking for in a conclusion of a series. Everyone got a satisfying and even happily ever after. Satisfying is actually the best word to describe this novel. Often the last installment of a good series is a let-down ( End of Days  or Clockwork Princess).But this one had it all: suspense, romance and diversity (even though I really missed queer characters). Great world-building and character-depth.Note: I think it's worth reading some OwnVoices reviews regarding the Asian representation in this series because I've heard it's very stereotypical and makes quite a few mistakes.Still, I am very thankful for Marissa Meyer writing  the Lunar Chronicles . Every single book was an amazing read and I can't wait for her new projects.Find more of my books on Instagram
