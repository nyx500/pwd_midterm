3.75* if I'm being specificI really enjoyed this, it was a great action packed conclusion but boy was it long. It kind of felt like the same thing over and over again after a while. Honestly I wish Fairest hadn't happened and this had been split into 2 books instead. The ending was meh but overall this was a very enjoyable series!!
