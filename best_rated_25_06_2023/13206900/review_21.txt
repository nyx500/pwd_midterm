never in my life would i have thought that i needed a sci-fi retelling of all the classic fairy tales. and yet here i am, four books and one amazing series later, shocked at how i could have even lasted this long without it. its quite difficult for me to rate and review this as just one book in a series, because this was honestly one of the best conclusions i have ever read. it was such a wonderful culmination of all the previous books, put into one. it truly felt like a finale, showcasing and celebrating what makes these books so great.there are a lot of positives about this, but i think the characters are the biggest accomplishment of this series. lets face it, the characters are the real reason why any of us continued with these books and i know we all have our favourites (cough WOLF cough). but whats especially impressive is how meyer took previously well-known characters and completely transformed them into a marvellous individuals of her own making. it was so entertaining to get to know them all in such a new light. and its these characters that i will forever remember when it comes to these books. there isnt much else i can say that hasnt already been said about this book and series. so if you havent picked up this series or need to complete it, do it as soon as possible. you wont regret it - i promise!!â†  4.5 stars
