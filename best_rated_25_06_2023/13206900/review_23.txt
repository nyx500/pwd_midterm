That's how you end a series. I am in love! A star for each one of my ships:*Scarlet & Wolf, forever my favorites. They, I think, have had the roughest journey of all, but they're love also seems the strongest. They never waver, especially in this book. *Cress & Thorne, who fully stole my heart in Winter. They are adorable beyond words, and so very, very perfect for each other.*Winter & Jacin, with their childhood love turned into something far fiercer and truer. They are each other's rocks in a world full of crazy.*Kai & Cinder, still a little awkward, but endearing as they're finally able to be a unit.I love them all. In that order, because sometimes I like to play favorites.And a star for every other brilliant thing Marissa does with her final book. Tense sequences, pacing that, even with over 800 pages, never lets up, the descriptive lunar setting, the number of times she ripped my heart out and left me breathless, dialogue that will have you laughing one minute, swooning the next, and fist pumping a second later, characters who are just so... them. One of my favorite things about this series is how unique each personality is, each romance is, each friendship is. All the different dynamics make me so damn giddy. I will love this motley crew of the Rampion - including Iko, still boy crazy, still hilarious - until the stars fade. Already I miss them dearly. Bravo, Ms. Meyer.
