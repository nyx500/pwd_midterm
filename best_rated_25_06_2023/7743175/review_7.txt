The final Wheel of Time book is a superb ending to a series that, without a doubt, is one of the greatest written accomplishments in the genre. While the series is not without some issues, Robert Jordan with some help from Brandon Sanderson has cemented his legacy with this epic that will endure through the ages and has given me endless hours of reading enjoyment and will do so again in the future. Thank you, Mr Jordan.The wind rose high and free, to soar in an open sky with no clouds. It passed over a broken landscape scattered with corpses not yet buried. A landscape covered, at the same time, with celebrations. It tickled the branches of trees that had finally begun to put forth buds.The wind blew southward, through knotted forests, over shimmering plains and toward lands unexplored. This wind, it was not the ending. There are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time.But it was an ending.
