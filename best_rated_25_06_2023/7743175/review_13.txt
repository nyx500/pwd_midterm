I was criticized for giving this five stars before it came out :) Which I suppose I can understand since it slightly affects the average score.Well, I've read it now and Sanderson did not disappoint. I loved the final volume of this super-epic, even though getting to the end was bittersweet.To review this book is to review the entire series. The bottom line is that while it has some low points (Crossroads of Twilight), even those have some pretty neat moments. I always cheered when I heard the book count was going UP, because I loved immersing myself in Robert Jordan's world.When Sanderson picks up the reigns in The Gathering Storm, the pace picks up dramatically and the more tiresome subplots are wrapped up very quickly.
