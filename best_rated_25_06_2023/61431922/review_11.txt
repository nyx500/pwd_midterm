– 5 starsSONG:The Great War – Taylor SwiftA dragon without its rider is a tragedy.A rider without their dragon is dead.how did I miss the feeling of reading such a good book that I couldn’t wait to run to my notes app once I finished the book and write down a thesis dedicated to how awesome the book is. This is the best book that came out this year. THANK YOU FOURTH WING AND REBECCA FOR CURING MY READING AND REVIEWING SLUMP! 🙏 first of all while there are a lot of reason why I absolutely adored this book, I gave this book 5 stars, because while reading Fourth Wing I was reminded again why I love reading. While I still enjoyed reading in the last 2 years, most of the books I’ve read just felt so average and boring. Every plot, every character written, every love story felt predictable like I’ve read it a million times already. Reading Fourth Wing on the other hand felt refreshing and unique. I was on the edge of my seat every chapter wanting to know what would happen next and every time something great happened it made me giddy as hell like I’m 13 again reading Twilight/The Hunger Games in the middle of night just immersing myself in a new world. The stakes are fucking high in this book and no characters is safe. The two main characters are safe due to plot amor, but everyone else? Fuck around and find out. 🌚 let’s start with a couple of selling points why everyone on planet earth and beyond HAS to give this book at least a try: ➟ this book is set in a WAR COLLEGE. What does that mean? Imagine Harry Potter meets Zodiac Academy, but deadlier. Navarre is in a conflict with another country (don’t ask me to name it, the names in this books are insane but not in a good way 😭 I can’t remember shit) so because of the war that is going on, the student at Basgiath War College learn battle strategies, train for battle etc. and students die all the times there. ➟ DRAGONS AND DRAGONRIDERS! I was always lowkey obsessed with books or shows that have dragons in it, but this book solified my obsession. Dragons actually can choose their riders and have magic how cool is that?! Once a dragon and a rider bonds, the rider can channel the dragon’s magic and it comes in all kind of forms. Someone could wield water, wind. Someone else can read memories through touching, Someone else can move objects. It’s fucking fantastic. ➟ GREAT WORLD BUILDING. Besides the magic and dragons and all that which is amazing. The whole world of this universe is so interesting. The names and places in this world are complicated af, but the world building was explained great imo. Instead of a big info dumping we get the information easily through dialogues. I also thought it was quite endearing see Violet recite random history about Navarre when she is under stressful situation to calm herself down. The 4 Quadrant groups at Basgiath War College are: ✎ Riders Quadrant: the dragon riders and the ones that protect the country and fight against the enemies. They also have the best reputation in Naverre, because of how badass they are. ✎ Healers Quadrant: are people who are the doctors and tend to all kind of injuries. There are also menders who are very rare who can mend broken bones quickly. ✎ Scribe Quadrant: the academics and scholars of Navarre.. basically the brainiacs who know all about the history and all wars etc. ✎ Infantry Quadrant: i’m honestly don’t know what they do.. i guess they are trained as soldier? idk really because we barely get informations about them and what they do.. ➟ SLOWBURN ENEMIES TO LOVERS ROMANCE. Violet and Xander are real enemies, since Violet’s mother killed Xanden’s father, but Xanderns father killed Violet’s brother!! so there is a lot of delicious tensions between them for a good reason. It takes them a while to open up, but when they do it’s explosive 🔥 so don’t worry there is smut and it’s very explicit you just have to be a little patient. ➟ CHARACTERS ON POINT. The whole cast of this book is interesting. Not one single boring character in sight. Even the villains or bad characters in this book have a spark to them that will make you want to know more. Also all the relationship, friendship and alliances forged are great. ➟ a very FAST PACED PLOT that will keep you on your toes. So much happens in this book I wouldn’t even know where to start summarizing it. ➟ DRAGONS.. i can’t mentioned this enough. These dragons are ruthless and cunning and so badass I can’t stop talking about them. All of the dragons have their own personality. If you love House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones! This book is for you besties. ✨ 🗡️ VIOLET SORRENGAIL (h) 🗡️“I’m not going to die today.”don’t we all root for the underdog and want to see them win? even tho I don’t think a perfect heroine exist, Violet makes an almost perfect fantasy heroine. She is the newest addition to my all time fav heroines that’s how awesome she is. 💅 All her life she has been called weak and fragile due to ther size. She was trained to be a Scribe, but because her mother is an infamous Rider and doesn’t allowed for anything else beside being a Rider and boy did everyone underestimate Violet. It was so easy to root for Violet, because she never had it easy or choose the easy way out. What I always hate about fantasy heroine is that they are the chosen one and are always special in some kind of way or kickass from the beginning and that’s not Violet. She might fall into the chosen one/special trope, but she literally had to claw and fight her way to the top. Violet doesn’t have raw physical power, so every obsticle and challenged she had to use her wit, intelligence, will and sheer determination. Violet’s most powerful organ is her brain. Another trait that I admire about Violet is her ✨compassion✨. The world, and especially Basgiath War College, is as cutthroat and ruthless as it can be. I fell in love with Violet the moment she decided to help a girl cross the parapet by asking her to switch one shoe with her since the other girl’s (Rhiannon) shoes were not made to cross that parapet, and she would have easily slipped and fallen to her death. Violet could have easily ignored that and let the competition take themselves out while making her climb simultaneously easier by having two good shoes, but that’s not how Violet is. How could I not root for her every step of the way? Impossible. My badass softie. 🥺🔹 XANDEN RIORSON (H) 🔹tall, broody, dark and handsome he embodies every typical fantasy hero to a T but who fucking cares it works, why change a running system?Xanden is so hot. The most powerful wing leader at the college? Hell yes sign me up! The way he doesn’t care about rules and what everyone expects of him 🛐 but the hottest thing about Xanden is that he always believed in Violet’s potential. While everyone else around Violet always tries to baby her and protect her from harm, Xanden challenges her to be better and get stronger. I can also not forget what a comedian Xanden could be with his sarcasm.. it took me out sometimes because I didn’t see it coming lmao. “Have you always been this tall?” I blurt the first thing that comes to mind.”No. I was a child at some point.”Xanden is tough on the outside and seems more broody than he already is, cause inside he is a lowkey softie. For the people he cares about he is loyal and would do anything for them and his friends would do anything for him as well. The loyalty is mutual. The found family y’all. 🥺👉👈Since the book is written solely from Violet’s POV there is so much about Xanden that intrigues me. He is still pretty much a mystery. There is so much about his past .. I’m looking at him and his mother’s relationship 👀 that needs to be uncovered. I want to know more about his relationship with his father as well since his father is the Great Betrayer who tried to rebel against Navarre’s king. There is so much potential to his backstory in book 2 and I can’t wait to find out more. 🐉 TAIRN & ANDARNA (DRAGONS) 🐉“Violet Sorrengail ,” she says as she writes in the Book of Riders. “Nice to see that you made it.” She offers me a quick, shaky smile. “For the record, please tell me the name of the dragon who chose you.” I lift my chin. “Tairneanach.”“Pronunciation could use some work.” Tairn’s voice rumbles through my head. “Hey, at least I remembered ,” I think back in his general direction, wondering if he’ll hear me across the field. “At least I didn’t let you fall to your death.” He sounds utterly bored, but he definitely heard me.My grumpy old dragon Tairn and my sunshine princess Andarna baby. 🥺😩 I have no words great enough to describe my love for these two dragons. This big ass dragon bonding with this tiny human being will never cease to amaze me. You know we all love the grumpy hero, but give the heroine a grumpy dragon and that relatonship HITS DIFFERENT. Tairn and Violet’s relatonship is so funny .. all their banters had me grinning like a little kid it was so fun. 🖤🧚 THE ROMANCE 🧚“Am I affecting your schedule, Violence?” There’s a definite smirk on those lips. “I just need to know what my chances are here.” My hands curl into fists. The ass has the nerve to smile. “That’s the oddest way I’ve ever been hit on—”“Not my chances with you, you conceited prick!”from enemies to reluctant partners to lovers? Their development was so on point without being toxic. Both of them hated with hate for each other for valid reasons, but it never got toxic between them like a lot of real enemies to lovers in fantasy do. He nips at my skin. “I’m not sweet. Please don’t mistake any part of me for soft or kind. That will only get you hurt, and whatever you do…” He buries his face in my neck, inhaling deeply. “Don’t fall for me.”Violetxander are the new standard for the “she fell first, but he fell harder” trope. Violet with her compassion can’t help but see the good in people, while it’s really hard for Xander to let anyone in let alone his mortal enemy. But his actions speak louder than his words. All the times he silently watches Violet, helped her, challenged her, trained her >>> I know he is obsessed with Violet even tho he is reluctant to admit his feelings for her.  👫 SIDE CHARACTERS 👫 “What did you want to be when you grew up?” I ask, just to keep the conversation going.”Alive.” He shrugs.Liam, Rhiannon, Imogen, Garrick and the rest. I love them all with and without their flaws.. some of them needed longer to grow and me then others, but eventually they all got me. They feel like family. 🙏I’d tell you to not get attached to them cause you don’t really now if they are making it until the end of the series or not, but honestly it’s not possible to not get attached to any of them. I’ll just be crying quietly in my corner when one of them eventually ends up dead bc of war and all. 😭👯‍♀️ VIOLET & MIRA 👯‍♀️“Don’t die, Violet. I’d hate to be an only child.” She grins and walks away, sauntering past the line of gawking candidates as word spreads of exactly who she is and what she’s done. Mira the older protective sister who Violet had to live in the shadow all these years. While there weren’t that many scenes with Violet and Mira together.. I adored their scenes.💥 THE DEPICTION OF WAR 💥One thing I liked a lot about Fourth Wing is how war is portrayed in this book. It might sound weird that I liked that a lot of people died in this book, but I thought that’s just realistic when it comes to war. Even the most efficient fighters in this book die not because they can’t protect themselves or fail in some kind of way, but some just do because they tried protecting their friends and some things don’t go their way. I never knew what would happen next and that was ✨ thrilling ✨. Nothing is black and white as it seems and to see that realization from Violet slowly throughout the book was so interesting. She started the book firmly believing in one side (her mother being a war hero and all that) and to see her journey by the end of this book is quite fascinating. In war it always takes at least two to tango and neither side are 100% right or wrong..it’s just a matter of perspective. CONCLUSIONFor people who know me or have been following my reviews for some time, they know I’m the stingiest of reader and find fault in everything and get bored easily 😭 but this book got me hooked from the beginning and it only got better with each chapter. Was everything perfect no? I could always nitpick on some things, but as a whole? Fourth Wing is a fantasy masterpiece. The pace, the characters, the plot, the romance, did I mention THE DRAGONS??? *chef’s kiss* I’d like to add that the book ends on a cliffhanger, but it’s a “wow I can’t wait what will happen next” cliffhanger so it’s a good kind of cliffhanger not one where you want to flush the book down the nearest toilet. 😌 but anyways WAKE ME UP WHEN IT’S NOVEMBER 7th!!┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑THE EMPYREAN SERIES#1 Fourth Wing – 5 stars#2 Iron Flame – tbr┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙
