5 ‚≠êÔ∏è If Throne of Glass, Divergent, Eragon, and Zodiac Academy had a baby. . . but this is better!!!*PS: I don't really even like ZA, but it's similar because of the academic setting, the heroine's journey to understanding her strength, and the enemies-to-lovers aspect (it's not quite a bully romance though).You know when you finish a book, and it leaves an ache in your chest because it was so good, and now it‚Äôs over? Yeah, that‚Äôs exactly how I feel after finishing Fourth Wing. Summary:There are only two ways to leave Basgiath War College: graduate or die. ‚Å†‚Å†Violet was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant and live a quiet life among books. However, when her mother, the commanding general, forces her to join the Riders Quadrants to become a dragon rider, she must push herself past all limitations in order to survive. ‚Å†‚Å†Staying alive would be a lot easier if Violet didn't have a target on her back for not only being 'small and frail' but the daughter of the woman responsible for the deaths of many cadet's traitorous parents, including Xaden Riorson's - the most powerful and ruthless wingleader. She should stay away from him, but a fire burns between these two that is bound to consume them both. ‚Å†‚Å†With stakes this high, every day could be her last. So Violet must learn to do the one thing she was never trained to do: fight. ‚Å†"I will not die today." -Violet Sorrengail‚Å†WHAT TO EXPECT:‚ú® adult romantasy ‚ú® true enemies to lovers ‚ú® war college setting ‚ú® dragon riders ‚ú® magic‚ú® underdog fmc / chronic illness rep ‚ú® scarred anti-hero mmc‚ú® unique world building ‚ú® complex politics‚ú® found family ‚ú® high stakes ‚ú® insta-lust with slow burn ‚ú® 2/5 üå∂Ô∏è (2 explicit spicy scenes)‚ú® cliffhanger ending My Thoughts:I am utterly obsessed! Mark my words, this is the next big romantasy series!The writing is easy to digest, the world-building is fascinating, the heroine is an underdog and total badass, and the romance develops at a believable pace and is scorching! I laughed. I cried. And I fell in love. This book will forever live in my head rent-free! ‚Å† Violet Sorrengail is a secret badass! I LOVE her!!!!! She‚Äôs a twenty-year-old bookworm who‚Äôs expected to live a life as a scribe but now must survive and become a dragon rider. Physically, she‚Äôs smaller and frailer than the other cadets in the quadrant, but that doesn‚Äôt make her weak. Her mind is her strength and what she needs to survive. I love how Violet handles her situation with courage and grace and how she creates meaningful relationships at the risk of her own heart. She‚Äôs extremely relatable, and I can‚Äôt wait to see how she grows. Xaden Riorson...this man has easily become one of my top book boyfriends of all time! The son of a traitor, he‚Äôs out for revenge against Violet, whose mother led to his father's death. From a distance, he‚Äôs a scary, scarred, intense anti-hero, but deep down, he‚Äôs a man who is loyal, caring, and wise. And the way this man obsesses with Violet‚Ä¶.damn. You truly don‚Äôt know if he wants to kill or f*ck her, probably both, but yeah, it‚Äôs hot! The things I would let this man do to me. ü•µThe enemies-to-lovers romance was perfect, with an intense slow burn and eventually spice! I appreciated the time it took for these two to finally get together. And when they finally do, it‚Äôs explosive! Thank goodness this is new adult fantasy because the things Xaden says and did go straight to my core, lol.  The dragons stole my heart. I don‚Äôt want to say too much because it would spoil some of the books, but they are terrifying and amazing!!! They have their own hierarchy and politics, which we don‚Äôt see much of since they‚Äôre very secretive, but it‚Äôs fascinating how they decide to bond with humans to create a symbiotic relationship that ultimately helps protect the land. Can't wait to learn more about them in the next book!  The found family aspect was done so well! As a dragon rider, you're encouraged not to form strong attachments since most people in your school will either die before becoming riders or later on during battle. But Violet goes against this and finds her ride or dies - specifically Rhiannon and Liam! üíï  The world building so easy to understand yet very interesting. I‚Äôve never actually read a series focused on dragons and dragon riders, so this was new and exciting for me! It was so interesting learning about the different quadrants - scribe, rider, healer, and infantry - and the schooling required for each. Obviously, this story focuses more on the Riders Quadrant, which honestly is the most exciting because it's so intense, challenging, and cutthroat. I personally don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd survive, but maybe if I had a friend like Violet, it would be possible!PS: For all you Manon and Abraxos fans out there, you‚Äôre going to fall in love with this world!!!For the most part, the story was a bit predictable, but it‚Äôs all done in a way that I was entertained and excited to keep reading! I mean, we've seen similar stories where the seemingly weak heroine finds herself in a kill-or-be-killed situation and has to learn to fight and ultimately ends up thriving. So in that regard, you can guess where the story is heading. HOWEVER . . . That ENDING was everything I was not expecting! Those last 50 pages were absolutely epic and blew my fucking mind!!!!!! I DID NOT see that ending coming! I cried and then was left stunned by that last sentence. It's a cliffhanger, but it'll leave you more in shock instead of in pain, so don't be afraid of it! It's brutal and will make you want to immediately pick up the next book. Luckily we don't have to wait for long since the release date is November 7, 2023!But with everything I love, there are a few things I didn't like . . .Sometimes, the wording Violet used to concerning Xaden was a bit repetitive and immature. She kept describing him as beautiful and hot anytime he crossed her mind or showed up. I wish she would have used other words from time to time. The reader has to essentially piece together why Xaden falls for Violet. It‚Äôs quickly explained later in the story, but by then, it felt like we were being told more than shown. I would have liked for him to verbalize it more during the story. At least, more than him just saying things like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stay away from you‚Äùor ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be the f*cking death of me‚Äù. Every time he's say those things, I was like, tell me why, though! Overall, Fourth Wing is an epic story that you will devour! I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a perfect 5-star read, maybe it‚Äôs closer to 4.5 since it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòperfect‚Äô, but honestly, I don't care. I haven‚Äôt read a fantasy I felt this way about in a long time, so I'm giving it all the stars.Thank you, Entangled Publishing, for sending me an arc copy in exchange for a review.
