=ã€‹I can't believe that I finished a 906 pages long book just in 3 days. This is a first. I also have been binge reading this epic high fantasy trilogy. Another first. Lots of Robin Hobb fans claim "The Liveship Traders" trilogy to be her best work. Never have anything sounded truer than this statement. This trilogy is a gem. I feel like a whole new world has been opened in front of my eyes. I love how character focused, atmospheric, tragic and emotional these books are. If they don't stir all different kinds of emotions in you, I am gonna change my name. It's so good.I absolutely love the characterization in the series. Both the good and bad characters are unique and shine on their own. The story Hobb has woven is mesmerizing and beautiful. The magic is fantastic. The writing is very immersive. Book 1 and 2 end with slight cliffhangers, all the three books are inter-connected. I am so in love with these characters that I couldn't help but start binge reading. Very glad that I did so cause I think I have just found my newest addiction.
