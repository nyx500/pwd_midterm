This series has drawn me in. These books came along at a perfect time in my life. I have had a chunk of downtime from work, and I have become totally immersed in these characters and this world. I am surprised I didn’t discover this author long ago, but I am also glad. They say everything happens for a reason and maybe it’s true. The timing of my running across this series and the way it worked together with my life has been an amazing experience.  This author’s ability to create living and breathing characters that grow, change, betray, love and die is perhaps unparalleled. It reminds me of my early days in reading long, in-depth fantasy books like Jordan and Goodkind, both of which appeared in my life and left indelible stamps on a time frame. Much the same way as a song can bring nostalgia and can perhaps remind me of a relationship or an era of my life, there have been books (or even a series of books) that have been able to do this for me as well. This is one of those series. The characters have demanded my undivided attention in order to get the full meaning of the events in their lives and their complicated relationships, which is why I am glad this came along when it did. The books are long, and the next one is nearly 1000 pages. I am both glad and slightly intimidated.  This series reminds me of why I love to read. The immersive world, characters that feel absolutely real, and conflicts that wind and twists through multiple settings and contradictions are making this not just a read, but an experience.. These characters are multi faceted containing both good and evil, selflessness and selfishness, truth and lies, and more – they are much like us.5.5 stars even though the rating system doesn’t go that high.
