While I enjoyed the first one, I didn’t overly adore it and was a tad hesitant going into this one. But this ended up being the book that ensured Hobb’s title as “favourite author” for me, because the level of intricacies and complexity to this book just blew my mind. Seeing the varied plot lines weave together had me in awe, but even more so the character development. Hobb made me change my mind completely about half the cast, before I even realised it had happened because it was just so naturally subtle. I can’t say too much more without spoilers, but this series is headed in a really interesting direction, and I genuinely cannot wait to read the last book to see what the outcome is!
