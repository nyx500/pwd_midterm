"What if you were sworn to protect the one you were born to destroy?"Raybearer is an impressive debut with an immersive world, complex characters, and an unexpected plot. It is well worth your time. This African-inspired fantasy is much more than cookie-cutter YA, offering thoughtful thematic content that explores misogyny, patriarchal structures, race and class inequality, empire and colonization, generational trauma, privilege, and the criminalization of young men of color. It's also a thrilling story with unexpected twists and a fierce heroine determined to forge her own path, despite everything. Tarisai grew up starved for touch and longing for love from her distant mother. What she doesn't know is she is essentially half-jinn, born of her mothers wish that she kill the prince after learning to love him and join his council. The plot is juicy, complicated, and doesn't go the way you think it will. There are wonderful side characters, friendships, forbidden romance, a soft Black boy who is pushed toward violence because of his physical size, scenes involving hair braiding, a dangerous underworld, lush descriptions, interesting magic, political intrigue, hidden secrets, and history rewritten by victors. It's smart and fun, and Jordan Ifueko is one to watch if this book is any indication. I received an advance copy of this book for review from the publisher.
