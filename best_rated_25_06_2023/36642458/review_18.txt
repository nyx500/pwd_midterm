unpopular opinion, but this story sadly didnt feel like sanderson to me. and that could be for a variety of reasons:- ive only read two other books by him, so i might not know him as an author yet. - this is my first time reading a YA/sci-fi book of his, so maybe im just not used to it. - this story feels like plenty of other books i have read before, some of which do this type of story better. and i think its the last point that is really bothering me. even with my limited experience with sandersons stories, i can tell that he has such an imagination and really excels at creating new and exciting worlds. but ‘skyward’ is honestly nothing that i havent read before. and for it to lack that originality and uniqueness i have come to expect from him, its leaving me a little disappointed.there is no doubt this book is a dream for both sanderson and sci-fi fans. there are truly awesome elements to it, but i just couldnt help but feel a bit bored by its predictability. i still love sandersons adult fantasy books, so maybe this genre by him just isnt my favourite. ↠ 3 stars
