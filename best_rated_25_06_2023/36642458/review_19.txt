Kindle Daily Deal: 29May22 for 2.99 here Totally worth that for M-bot and DoomslugThis review was originally posted on Books of My Heart“That music the water makes,” she said. “Isn’t it the most wonderful sound ever?”“The most wonderful sound ever is the lamentations of my enemies, screaming my name toward the heavens with ragged, dying voices.” Bless My Stars this was fantastic! You know how you are going along in your life thinking that most of the stuff you are reading is good, and it is, but then you read something and it makes everything else seem dull by comparison. Skyward (most Brandon Sanderson books actually) was like that for me.Let me tell you that this book has absolutely no kissing in it, like none and I still LOVED it. Not liked, but thought if it has more romance it would be better, no I LOVED this book and thought that everything about it was perfect. Sure, I’m hoping long term we are warming up and there will be a romance but SCUD it, I’ll be okay if there isn’t one, you can *gasp* in amazement now.So you probably want to know why this is in my TOP 3 books for 2018 at the moment.:First there is the MC Spensa a.k.a. spin. She is just this wonderfully fun character so full of anger, bravado and temper. Plus she has a great imagination and I love every single time that she tells someone off, it is hilarious and slightly barbaric. She even gets a doomslug for her mascot and finds and incredibly funny talking ship along the way. “Is my father why I’m such a mess of anger, bravado, and temper? Is the fact that they call him a coward the reason I walk around with my sword in hand, screaming that I’ll make a pile of everyone’s skulls, then stand on that to help me behead the people who were too tall for me to reach?”Kimmalyn smiled fondly. “Bless my stars?” I asked her. “Every single one of them, Spensa. Every single bouncing star.” Second is the mystery of this world. Why are the humans even fighting the Krell, how come the Krell never field more than 100 ships, what is the truth behind the death of Spensa’s father, what is the history of these people and how they came to this planet, where did M-bot come from etc, etc. Sanderson always does a great job of surprising me and this book had some big surprises in it.Third is the side characters. Spensa’s flight school classmates make up a wide blend of different characters and it is so much fun to watch them go from a disjointed collection of kids to a group of friends and team mates. Alas this is a dangerous place and not all the kids are going to make it to graduation. The danger is real and I felt every second of the suspense in each battle wondering who wouldn’t be coming back. Still I loved getting to know all of them and each brought something special to the story.Fourth is M-bot, I know I mentioned him above (talking ship) but I think that I highlighted almost everything M-bot said in this book. He was hilarious and brought some much-needed comic relief to the story. Truly my favorite side character in the story."You have large twin destructor emitters on each wing, along with a light-lance turret underneath. That’s as much firepower as our larger ships. You’re a warship.” “Clearly not,” M-Bot said. “I’m here to categorize fungi. Didn’t you listen to my last orders? I am not supposed to get into fights.” “Then why do you have guns?” “For shooting large and dangerous beasts who might be threatening my fungus specimens,” M-Bot said. “Obviously.”And lastly was the Son of a Supernova ‘Jerkface��� himself. I love when your perceptions of someone can be changed over the course of a story. I pretty much hated him at the beginning but by the end I guess I could say that a ‘ship’ might be in my future for this series. I could definitely get on board a Spensa/Jerkface ship in the long run. I haven’t read a lot of space opera’s but I think that this book has something in it for every fantasy lover and most readers. It was entertaining, emotional and had just about everything I want in a book (I mentioned the no kissing already). I have over 230+ highlights and can’t wait to reread it sometime in the near future, probably right before the next book comes out. So if you didn’t get that I’m very enthusiastic about this book let me say 3 final words. READ THIS NOW!!! Audio Note - I have never been disappointed with a narrator for a Sanderson book and the streak still holds. Suzy Jackson was fantastic. She performed this book splendidly and I always knew who was talking. Her portrayal of Spensa was great and M-bot so funny. I haven’t listened to anything she narrated before but I’ll definitely look through her catalogue to see what else I might like. I listened at my normal 1.5x speed.
