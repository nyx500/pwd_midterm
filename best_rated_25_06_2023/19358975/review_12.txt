The weirdness continues in the third volume of this excellent series. I must admit, I expected it to lose its dazzling nature after the first volume but none of its awesomeness has diminished. I have high hopes that it will remain persistently good unlike so many other comics that fluctuate in quality.The best thing about this volume is a cyclops author who knows how to make a fucking great entrance and a lasting impression: And from here the first few issues fall into discussions about the importance of literature (even in a war torn world full of aliens, monsters and sexual deviants like this one.)Books can change the world and one particular book by this crazy cyclops man has brought the two central characters together, which led them to his door to seek answers about what do next. And of course even weirder shit follows them and it all ends rather quickly. As well written as the majority of the characters are in here, itâ€™s great to see them get killed off in random ways. It bodes very well at this stage that the author is willing to kill when he needs to.I really hope this series never loses its momentum. Bring on volume four!
