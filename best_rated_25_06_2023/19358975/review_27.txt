Not quite as good as the first two volumes. Still a lot of fun. And also a lot more funny.Some cool new characters get introduced. And we learn what the true opposite of war is. Come to think about it, it was fairly obvious really.Only three stars this time because the story came almost to a standstill in this volume.Itâ€™s just a quirky fun time with these quirky fun characters. I like them all so much, I almost forgot they are actually fighting each other. But Vaughan reminds us in the end. I was almost shocked.Good stuff!2021 addendum:Apparently I can't be trusted with my ratings. Reading this a second time, and it was simply wonderful. What amazes me is that in spite of all the different species in this series, that are standing on different (sometimes opposing) sides, having different interests and different methods to go about their business, and despite all the weird things that are happening to them, Vaughan's characters just feel so normal. They feel like people. Normal people, like you and me. And that's why they make us feel, well, everything.Buddy read with Nataliya. And we don't want to stop.
