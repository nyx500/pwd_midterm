Rating: 4.5 starsIt's hard to believe that there can be even more action after Red Rising, but lo and behold! My heart breaks for these characters... they have loved and lost so much, but they just keep on fighting for what they believe is right. It was great spending more time with this crew, and meeting some fantastic new characters, too! I love Darrow's brain - he comes up with the most clever, and often crazy, plans, and it was so much fun (yet stressful) seeing them unfold.
