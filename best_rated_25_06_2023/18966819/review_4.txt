the best thing about this reread is i already knew what happens, so i didnt feel so personally betrayed this time around. but that ending is still so gorydamn painful. ugh.___________________________________lets talk biology. goosebumps are a fight or flight response. usually (temperature excluded), they occur when experiencing intense emotions towards something and adrenaline is released throughout the body.so what does it say about this book that i had goosebumps pretty much throughout the entire thing?? it means this book is straight up chilling and, good gosh, i am in utter disbelief right now. i honestly dont know if i finished this book or if it finished me. thats how im feeling right now.the range of emotions i felt whilst reading this is exhausting. i feel like a wet towel that has been wrung out for every last drop of water. i never knew i could feel so much. i am R E E L I N G.ps. i still think pierce brown is a total hottie and, after reading this, im pretty sure im in love. <3â†  5 stars
