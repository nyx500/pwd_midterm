❝My son, my daughter, now that you bleed, you shall know no fear, no defeat, only victory. Your cowardice seeps from you. Your rage burns bright. Rise, warrior of Gold, and take with you your Color’s might.❞THAT ENDING. I AM SPEECHLESS. I don't even know what to say. This book was full of surprises. Literally. I did not see any of this coming. This series just keeps getting better and better. You'd think that Golden Son would suffer the "book before the finale" syndrome but NOPE. Not even close. Pierce Brown just set us up for one of the most epic finales ever. I just know it.My poor Darrow. My heart breaks for him so much. He's lost so much and he's been betrayed so many times. I can't handle this. All my favorite characters, everyone, is NOT safe and it scares me so much. Please protect my babies!And let me just say that I ship Darrow and Mustang 1000%. I ship them so much, it literally hurts. Mustang is a goddess and I hope she finally comes to her senses soon!LASTLY, WE NEED TO PROTECT SEVRO AND RAGNAR AT ALL COST. Nobody is worthy of them.I can't even write a proper review because that ending just destroyed me and now I have to go binge read the finale. BYE.
