Golden Son has officially wrecked me. I'm actually checking my pulse right now to make sure I'm still alive. Status unclear.Picking up approximately 2-years after the events of Red Rising, we continue to follow our intrepid hero, Darrow au Anadromedus, also known as, The Reaper. His secret war against the Golds, rages forth. The ultimate goal of which is to demolish the status quo.Full of the same action-packed, pulse-pounding battle scenes as the first book, this installment amps up the level of political intrigue. It left my head spinning, and yes, that's a good thing!My favorite part of this continues to be the world-building. Brown has created a dark, dystopian world with all of the brutality of ancient Rome, but set in space. As we all know, everything is better...Additionally, the characters are compelling and well-fleshed out. Darrow is particularly riveting. I love his evolution as a character and have truly felt for him as he grapples with impossible decisions that ultimately end up haunting him.It's hard to lead a revolution. Particularly one that is hidden. A proverbial snake in the grass, who can he trust with his secrets?Darrow's pain and joy are visceral. I felt every moment. Relationships are continuing to develop and as always, there is a healthy dose of back-stabbing and ruthless betrayals mixed in for good measure.I am really looking forward to moving on with this story. My plan is to continue with the audiobooks. The narrator is Darrow to me. They couldn't have selected a better voice artist! So well done.If you haven't picked up this genre-bending series yet, I cannot recommend it highly enough!
