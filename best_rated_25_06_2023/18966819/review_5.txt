Psst. A new video is up - all about the bad books I've read this year! Now that you know that this one is on it, check out the Worst Books of 2019 video to see what other ones made the cut! The Actual Review I don't know what's wrong with me but this one is so gory-damn boring that I could scream. Am I the only one?Does it get better???- An Eternity Later -It didn't get better, but on the plus side, this book is over! I can FINALLY read something else! The ReviewOkay. So. A lot happens in this book.And most of it isn't important.The premise is still the same - Darrow's world is incredibly caste-divided (Reds - workers, Golds - rulers, Pinks - sex slaves, etc) and thanks to genetic modification, everyone is perfectly adapted to their role.However, Darrow, a Red, is transformed into a Gold and given a secret mission to infiltrate the higher-up world of Golds in order to dismantle their world from the inside-out.Last round we had a hunger-games-esque free-for-all only with far more brutal murders and actual scheming.It was hella-interesting to have the Greek-themed houses strategize and overthrow. I was so invested in the howlers and the fate of Darrow...but this round? Ehhh.Darrow flies around on a ship, wheeling and dealing as he gains more power. There's a couple of big bads but Darrow's big brain saves him every time.I just really wasn't feeling it - too much was happening and it was all too big. We are talking about the fate of billions of beings and intricate worlds and politics galore - and I'm just not about that life.It's the sort of issues which take decades to resolve in any meaningful manner and I just don't feel like sticking around for it.Sorry folks - I'm out.Audiobook CommentsRead by Tim Gerard Reynolds - the only good thing about this book was the quality of its narration.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
