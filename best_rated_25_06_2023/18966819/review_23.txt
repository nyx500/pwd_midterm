Bloodydamn!!! What an epic second instalment. I am SHOOK!  What do you suppose they would think of us?” I ask. “Of man?” “I suppose they would think we’re beautiful, strange and inexplicably horrible to one another.  This series has me hook line and sinker! Darrow and his band of loyal friends are planning to destroy their enemies. Meanwhile Darrow has agreements and plans with The Jackal, The Sons of Ares and Augustus. He can’t follow through with them all. But the real question is, who is deceiving him?Twist after twist. We never know who will do what, or who will die next. It’s constant, edge of your seat battles and politics and I could not get enough!And when we get to the end  and Roque betrays him  I was blown away. I honestly didn’t see that coming at all and it made me so mad! I ordered book 3 immediately because I cannot wait!
