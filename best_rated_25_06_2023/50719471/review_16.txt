***Contains Spoilers***Oh man, I really enjoyed the first book and I was dying to find out what happened. I was so disappointed in this book. It goes from crisis to crisis, the character development majorly lags/is non existent. Lara is wallowing in shame the whole time. Plot holes abound; Lara was right behind her father during that dance scene and she doesn't take the opportunity to slit his throat?! So I'm thinking Jensen has a better revenge death in mind for him, but then his death is just as quick in the end. They keep rehashing the same argument THE ENTIRE book. Aren is being a jerk the ENTIRE book. The whole dessert scene with Lara being caught as a thief would never have happened, and was so unnecessary. And then we dived way deep down the 'fantasy/physical impossibility' rabbit hole when there was a sex scene following Lara almost dying of blood loss from a near mortal leg wound that Aren stitches up for her. Whaaat?! Just so many problems with that scene. Questionable consent since someone who lost that much blood is not thinking straight. Not to mention no one's feeling frisky after losing that much blood. Also, what kind of sadist is Aren that he's turned on after sewing up layers of muscle and flesh while covered in her blood?! Gross, Bro. Not to mention the major infection risk. Ugh. And then, then afterwards he gets mad at her!!! I was definitely not loving the book already and then that scene put me over the edge. In addition to all of that the ending was poorly thought out and then rushed. You made me suffer through all that misery for 2 minutes(audiobook only right now) of a happy ending?! Bogus. I feel cheated. Likes: Lara and her Sister's relationships. Zara and Keris, definitely ship them.
