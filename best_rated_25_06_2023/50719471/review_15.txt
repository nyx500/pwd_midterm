PositivesI preferred this to book1, the things I liked about the first instalment namely world & side characters were added to in this one, sadly just not nearly enough for this rating to be much higher 🤷‍♀️I liked how the world expanded and the new characters that were introduced - but we did not get to spend nearly enough time with them (or Ahnna for that matter)! However the fact that the later books are rumoured to focus on some of these characters gives me hope and may entice me to pick them up. I cannot pretend I am not curious about the next pairing especially considering where this book left off altho I do hope we get some flashbacks to see how the strongly hinted at relationship began 😈 🤐I'm also crossing my fingers and lowkey hoping for more page time for the amazing siblings that only got a small yet impactful cameo in this book. I'd really love to find out so much more about each of them - such interesting lives they could lead as mercenaries or just in general trying to pick up the pieces and/or putting their lives together despite what they've been put through. The stories and mental health representation that could be told through these PoV as each adjusts to a new normal while reckoning with their pasts could be fascinating novellas.If this route is chosen please don't pair them all off and have "love" (ab)solve everything that came before - soz if the cranky cynical spinster is showing 🙈On to what I disliked - AREN🤬🙄😡I found him naive & irksome in book1. I couldn't see the amazing leader we were told he was and this just got worse for me in this book as he continued to make stupidly selfish decisions while being an absolute ass for a good 60% of the story & then doubled down with some more dumb decisions as the end neared...I just don't see how I'm supposed to like or root for him when almost every decision he made about his relationship seemed to be the wrong one and/or for dumb reasons! Or rather he'd make a seemingly right decision, but then fail to follow through & toss the cat amongst the pigeons with his actions *exasperated-sigh*The ending was rather ridiculous & pretty far fetched even for a fantasy read - if anyone else has read this please share thoughts in spoiler tags below because erm...whut?! 🙄🤦‍♀️Last thing that really got to me, was that this series is pitched as a sexy romance read?Hard NOPE to this I'm afraid.The sex scenes (one per book) were so misplaced imho! Just NO!I didn't particularly find them sexy as the timing of both were seriously WTF?! moments for me. Book1 Lara had almost drowned amongst many others revelations that rocked her sheltered/curated beliefs that day & book 2 her leg was practically hanging off?! Ok so it had been stitched, but seriously...blood loss people?!Not to mention the mental impact of the lead up to both scenarios - i just don't get it & then he walks out. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK - you absolute moronic coward! I didn't love Lara in book1, but she deserves so much better than what he's been shown capable of offering her in terms of emotional support as she's going to have so much to unpack when the dust settles - cockroach or no & there's no doubting she's a survivor...i just don't like him for her 😯Am I alone here on this ledge of wth kind of timing was that for these scenes?To finish on a more positive note Lara was much improved for me in this. Altho tbf, prob not hard considering so many of her choices were maddening in the first book. Sure the ending was kind of Mary Sue levels of ridic but I enjoyed her character arc and growth through the earlier parts of the story + seeing how she went about atoning for the consequences of her decisions & (in)actions in the previous instalment. The bad ass we were told about in the first book came to play, she had many action filled scenes to show off the training we were told about and her scheming + plotting was more interesting to read about than the vaguely boring poisoning and sneaking about activities of the earlier book. Plus she was willing to make the sacrifices that Aren kept foiling with his wishy washy back and forth inability to stick to his decisions *sigh*Oops this was supposed to be ending on a positive note so prob best I not linger on the character that deffo irked me the most over both books but especially this one. Cannot say I'm not lowkey glad the rest of the series will follow other characters while I wait to see if I'll continue with it...guess it depends on price of kindle versions and/or whether my library gets copies 😅I am curious to see how the next MCs handle the fall out from the ending of this book as it'll deffo move up their timeline & I'm wondering how this pairing will even work considering the Romeo + Juliet "our families are mortal enemies" type set up 🤔I really hope wherever this series goes that the scheming long game MC we met in this book and the rule bending general don't become wishy washy love lost puppies that make silly decisions risking their kingdoms *ahem* & that the cameo scene stealing siblings make welcome returns somehow 😇Although I'm not holding my breath on that front as sadly I think they may be fridged 😕 In saying that I would dearly love to be proven wrong on that front 🤗I'm tempted to go 3.25* as I did like Lara more this time and the world expansion plus new characters were all fun but then I remember the OTT ending & Aren's (🤬) shenanigans and I cannot go higher than 3* ... this does, however give the series massive scope for improvement & based off the foreshadowed incoming MCs I hope it will 🤞
