“Awake or asleep, all I see is your face. All I hear is your voice. All I feel is you in my arms. All I want is you.”I loved this book so much! This was a fantastic and action-packed fantasy romance about love, betrayal, revenge and the cost of power. The Traitor Queen follows Lara as she goes on a journey of hardship and love to save Aren. Along the way she meets new enemies and allies and learns more about herself. This book is told from Lara and Aren's point of view. I was swept up in this brilliant world that the author created from the very beginning. The world building is amazing! This book has everything I wanted in fantasy romance including political intrigue, amazing characters, enemies to lovers romance, slow-burn and awesome chemistry between the two main characters. The pacing was perfect and the plot was exciting from the beginning till the end. The characters in the book were complex and interesting. My favorite character is Lara, she is fierce, badass, resilient, tenacious, brave, and caring towards the people she loves. I loved Lara's character development in this book, she grew so much and showed that she will do whatever it takes to protect Aren and Ithicana. I love Aren so much, he is handsome, brave, sweet, kind, charming, and strong. I really liked the new characters we were introduced to especially Lara's sisters and Zarrah. The chemistry between Lara and Aren was amazing and I loved their relationship. The spice was SO good!! The author is an excellent writer, the descriptive writing allowed me to vividly picture everything in my head. The ending was so great! I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, romance, enemies-to-lovers romance and excellent characters.
