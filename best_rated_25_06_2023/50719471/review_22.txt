There's something. Something about this couple (mainly the hero) that's lacking. It's like, it's almost there but not quite.Anyhow, something that I really love about this book is the world building. The descriptions of these places we went to. The desert, Valcotta and the islands. This is what always saved the book for me.Because as per the romantic relationship, I didn't get it enough. Hell, Aren and Jor has a better relationship than him and Lara. I don't know why or where it went wrong, but I feel like there is something lacking between these two. It's like they're almost perfect. Almost.But the world building.... It was one of the best.
