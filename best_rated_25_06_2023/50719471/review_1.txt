THIS WAS SO BLOODY GOOD. HOW AM I MEANT TO WAIT A YEAR FOR THE NEXT ONE?!?!!! ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜©Right. So, I'll be brief as to not spoil anyone. I know Lara made some pretty major mistakes in the previous instalment, but I thought that she was treated a bit unfairly here, despite her vigorous efforts to make up for all of her wrongdoings. I absolutely LOVED meeting all of her sisters though and seeing how protective they were of each other. ðŸ’™ I also really want to see them bond with their brother, Keris, in the future books!Aren, especially, frustrated me because he was so flip-floppy. He was a man who was so used to having his country AND his queen, that when faced with having to choose between the two...he turned into an indecisive idiot. I just wish that there'd have been a more satisfactory reunion for the two of them at the end of the book. It was a tad anticlimactic. That's literally the only criticism that I have. But not to worry! There were some definite swoon-worthy parts that had me audibly squealing in happiness, despite the wee hours in the morning. I read this whole thing in two sittings, refusing to put it down until it was finished at 5am because YES...it was THAT GOOD. I genuinely can't wait for the next two books in the series, even though it follows two new characters, who were introduced in this instalment. Watch me re-read The Bridge Kingdom and The Traitor Queen *again* before the end of the year, haha. I HIGHLY recommend picking this series up, if you haven't yet. It's Danielle L. Jensen's best series to date...and that's saying something! ;)
