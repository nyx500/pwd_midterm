“She was everything. Mind, body, and soul, she was everything he wanted. Everything he needed. The queen Ithicana needed.” This book was an emotional adventure, and I’m obsessed with Lara and Aren. ❤️The Traitor Queen is fast paced and plot driven. The many twists, obstacles, and fights make this book hard to put down. Sure some parts are more detailed than necessary, but the story is irresistible overall. Lara and Aren are very well written in this book, and I liked getting to know Aren a bit better. Their romance is heartbreaking at times but still swoon worthy. A big theme explored is the parts that forgiveness and trust play in love. I screamed at intense moments, sighed with relief during tender moments, and I continue to adore their story. While the plot is exciting, the characters are what have my heart and most of my attention. Many new supporting characters are introduced that are easy to like, admire, and sympathize with—especially Zarrah and Keris. I loved The Bridge Kingdom, so I had high expectations for this book and it did not let me down. Danielle L. Jensen writes characters that are full of depth, creates worlds that are immersive, and gives readers stories that hurt as much as they heal. I highly recommend this series and am looking forward to the next book.
