All Hail the Traitor Queen3.5 stars, but I rounded it up because Lara deserves it! Not nearly as good as the first one, but still a fast-paced, action-packed and nerve-wracking rollercoaster I couldn't put down until the final page was turned. I know this book was released as an audio book long before the printed version, and I wonder if that has affected the editing.. Mini-rant for those of you who've already read the book. I am super disappointed by the ending. It didn't do the story, the characters or the readers any justice, and it felt quite under developed. It might have to do with the author choosing to continue the series with different characters, making this ending rather abrupt, but it still feels like I've been robed.Short RTC when I find the time.
