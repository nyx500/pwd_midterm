Possibly my favourite of the Song of the Lioness series! It was really only let down by silly character motivations and I think logic was impacted by that, because some characters act so out of character to advance the plot. Some of it was too easily wrapped up too. However, some moments tore my heart out so for that, it gets a solid 4 star!
