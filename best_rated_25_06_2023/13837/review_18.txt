This isn't the most subtle series, but I do like its positive messages (even if they're not subtle), one of which is that it's possible to be true to yourself, which in Alanna's case means coming to terms with the fact that she doesn't need to fit neatly or exclusively in a "man's world" or a "woman's world."I also find it interesting that, unlike in most fantasy novels, especially those oriented toward younger girls, Alanna not only has several lovers, but uses a magic birth control amulet! (Not so sure if conservatives would be so happy if they found out their daughters were reading this series ;p) Although simplified I was intrigued by the fact that the relationships were more realistic, or at least touched upon common relationship themes:Boy #1: High-school sweetheart (or in this case knight-in-training sweetheart) whom you still love but whom you are not going to marry because you've grown into different people and your lifestyles aren't compatibleBoy #2: The guy you love who makes you laugh and has always accepted you for who you are. Obviously you're going to end up with this guy, but I thought it was different that Alanna ended up seeing Boy #3 for a whileBoy #3: Someone that you're attracted to and like as a person, but, for whatever reason, can't accept all of who you are but you still care aboutAs a girl who never got along as well with other girls as with guy buddies, I thought that it was also refreshing to read a book about successful opposite gender friendships, including some that lasted after the "romance thing" was over.
