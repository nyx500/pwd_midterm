Winner of Goodreads Choice Awards for Comics and Graphic NovelsI don't understand how that happened because I read a lot of comics and graphic novels and I'd never even heard of this until the nomination. Then again, I assumed they (THEY?) just looked for something with a pastel cover and clapped their hands in joy. I don't personally get the hype, but I can see why this was successful as a webtoon.And honestly, webtoons are so popular now that I think they deserve their own category.Please?Anyway, this wasn't terrible.It's got chubby art, a nice color palette, and an easily digested storyline that updates and retells the Hades/Persephone story in a SQUEE kind of way. Not a lot happens here, so I'm not really getting the level of OMGFLAIL that I see happening in the reviews. Again, this may be due to the fact that this has been miscategorized as something someone who enjoys regular comics would want to read. The gist is that Hades and Persephone lock eyes at a boujee party, and then everyone proceeds to act like awkward 12 years olds. Is that the audience? My 14 year old daughter is the one who recognized it, so she's actually the one I originally bought it for, but my curiosity got the better of me after I saw all the rave reviews.If this is middle grade, then I apologize because I thought it was an adult story, so my expectations might have been off a bit.
