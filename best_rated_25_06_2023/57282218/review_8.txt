Yeah, besides the art, I just don't get the hype for this one. Naive sunshine girl and grumpy older guy is a hard ship to sell me on, especially since this has a pretty big age gap. So much of a big deal was made of Persephone's naivety that it just made me feel uncomfortable. This also felt like nothing really happened? Like there were two, maybe three plot points in this. On the plus side, I liked the art and I liked Hades for the most part, and I really liked Hera since she's usually made into a one-note jealous wife in Greek mythology retellings.
