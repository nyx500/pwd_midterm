Reread of one of my formative fantasy reads, and the first book I read by David Gemmell. I have not read over eleven works of his, and he is among my favourite authors. But this is the first book of his I have reread. Legend has been one of my favourite books for a long, long time. So, I was very excited to be going back and rereading this, but there was also an element of nerves as I hoped this would reach the lofty heights that I remember. So, was it?In short, yes!
