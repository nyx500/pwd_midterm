4.5 Stars ⭐️ Omg!!! Why did I wait so long to read this book!! I love me some revenge books!!! Eff them up Tau!! The freaking action in this book is right out of the gates people. The battles! I was on the edge in my mind screaming, KILL THEM ALL!! I didn’t feel there was too much world building in this book. I felt it was more character driven which is just fine with me. You don’t want to step away from the characters for one freaking minute! And I love Tau! He’s my hero..uh...warrior. I loved all of the characters.  Tau had so many things happen to him and it made me sad for him and all involved. But.... And just like that, there was no going back. A dragon had been called, and someone would have to die.Yeah, bitches! He’s coming for you!! Woot! 😂🤣Mel 🐶🖤🐺🐾BLOG: https://melissa413readsalot.blogspot....
