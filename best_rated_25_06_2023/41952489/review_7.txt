Damn, this book was good. ASIDE from the fact that its setting is so refreshingly unique, the pacing is extraordinary. And by 'extraordinary' I mean that once it gets rolling--and it gets rolling almost right off the bat--it never lets up. Seriously, though: NEVER. Important scenes are followed by equally important scenes, which are followed by sudden revelations, which are followed by shocking loss, and then the whole thing repeats again. The chapters--short but not too short--are the perfect size to keep you thinking that reading just one more before setting it down is probably a good idea.To summarize: big, epic, exciting, and, unless you're from the future, like nothing you've read before.
