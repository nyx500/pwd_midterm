All my regards to NetGalley and Hodder & Stoughton for proving me with this digital ARC in exchange for my honest review This is my first Margaret Owen book, so my expectations were extremely high. I just finished this one hour ago and I don't think I will be able to tell if this book lived up to them yet.I went into this book without the knowledge that it is a retelling of "The Goose Girl", but that's okay, because I cannot, for the love of my life, remember what it was about, so that was okay. This book lives up perfectly as its own. While reading, I couldn't tell this was a retelling at all, so I assume that Owen did a good job?This is set in an Ancient German empire-inspired world. I adore the dark and mysterious atmosphere. The magic system with the Gods is also amazing (and one of them is genderfluid or non-binary!! diversity for the win!!)Nevertheless, the absolute highlight of this book is the character development. Throughout 500 pages, Owen managed to build complex and compelling characters whose actions are motivated and relatable. The protagonist, Vanja, is an anti-hero and more villain than hero. However, her actions are justified and relatable. Her journey to accept kindness and affection truly affects me in a personal way (and the found family is *chef's kiss*). I don't know what to do with that ending, should I be worried???However, this book is not perfect. I have a few problems with this book. For example, this book could have easily been 350 pages-ish instead of 500. Some passages are unnecessarily dragged out. Furthermore, this was not an easy read for me. There is something about the first 40% that gives so much pain (I took 10 days to read the first 40% while I crushed the rest in two hours) At last, this was an interesting and dazzling read. The writing style is not really my thing, but I would recommend checking this book out if you want an atmospheric and mysterious dark fairy tale.
