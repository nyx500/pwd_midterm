This is one of those rare situations where I wish I could give a book more than five stars. It blew my mind in so many ways that I can’t even get it in writing how good I thought this book was. Think of something, it did it amazingly. First of all, I LOVED the tone where it felt like the main character, Vanja, was talking straight to the reader. It felt like I was part of the story and pulled me right in, it was even better that it was full of snark and sarcasm. And following the morally gray character was beyond fun, but Vanja’s character growth was also perfection! All the side characters was so well done and with fleshed out personalities. I think the shapeshifter Ragne is my all time favorite, she just lights up the page every time. And the romance was slow burn and so sweet, but also snarky but also explored insecurities and vulnerability. This book is chunky and a lot of things happens, so I would understand that some people will find it a bit heavy. I didn’t mind it, because I was so invested and even thought it added to the story. Because everything was so well worked through and nothing is left unanswered. In my opinion, it is perfect. It doesn’t hurt either that I have Illumicrate’s special edition and it’s the prettiest book I own. This book makes me happy in every way.
