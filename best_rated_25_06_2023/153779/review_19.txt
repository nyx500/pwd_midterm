While I didn't love Terrier – the first book in the Beka Cooper series – I absolutely adored this one. Achoo and Pounce are still my favorite characters, and I think Beka is really coming into her own. This volume felt very fast compared to Terrier, and I'm excited to move onto the third book in the trilogy very shortly...
