I loveeeee Beka so damn much!! This girl is what law enforcement should look up to. She wants to protect her people and keep harm from them by making criminals pay their due. For all her determination and intelligence, Beka is hindered by inadequate partners and is really struggling with it. However, a counterfeiting ring is growing and soon she is sent undercover with Goodwin to Port Caynn. I loved seeing Beka undercover and trying to be a "loose Dog". It was awkward and funny, but eventually she got the hang of it. Girl could probably be an amazing actress if she wanted. We meet more characters from Port Caynn and that includes an amazing LGBTQ rep from a character heavily invovled in the plot!  I loved the trans rep that Okha/Amber stood for and that Nestor loved him as Okha and as Amber. It was adorable and heartwarming. I love the Dogs and I think Beka is instilling great changes in it. Plus she's so cool with her pigeons and dust spinners. I love how she gets information from so many sources.
