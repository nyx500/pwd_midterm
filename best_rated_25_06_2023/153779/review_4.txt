Took me twice as long as it ought, but I've FINISHED IT. I have to wonder if Tammy ever finds Beka's Lower City slang creeping into her daily speech -- I've been using it to insult the cats when they piss me off lately xD Another great adventure for Beka. I liked the change of scenery that was Port Caynn (although I will say I called it in regard to certain people being involved in certain unsavory things possibly the second or third time his name cropped up). And it was really interesting to meet a third Rogue (aside from Rosto, and George in the other Tortall books). Pearl was something else. If you liked Terrier, there's no reason you shouldn't like Bloodhound, I'll say it like that.That said, I'm not sure why I'm settling for the 4-4.5 rating. Terrier got 5 stars and I LOVED it, but I never got distracted while I was reading Terrier -- seriously I think I've read ten books in between picking up Bloodhound. It was never boring and I loved the story but... idk maybe it just didn't grab me as much as Terrier did? I like to think if it had I never would've put it down and thus would have finished it much sooner.Also, DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT OUR GODDESS AND SAVIOR, CLARY GOODWIN? I love this woman so much. And apparently in my head she looks like Riza Hawkeye but with black hair. Like if Mustang and Hawkeye had a daughter, that's what she would look like. And if you're not familiar with FullMetal Alchemist, I will happily fling it at you :DOne more thing and then I'm done updating, I swear-- I was actually glad for Pounce's absence throughout much of this book. On top of dealing with so many new characters, Goodwin AND Achoo, I don't think I could have handled Pounce's added cattiness (harhar). I was glad to see him again by the end, but by then I was getting a condescending vibe from him instead of the usual snark.
