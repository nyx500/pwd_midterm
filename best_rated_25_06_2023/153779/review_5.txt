Uhhhh..... What should I say? I loved it and didn't at the same time. Does that make any sense? I'll have to explain myself.We get to see the same great action sequences and heart that Beka has. Though we only stay in Corus for probably a fourth of the book and I thought the change of scenery did the series good. There is a trickle of new characters that come in. The most notable her new dog, Achoo. This comedian of a dog really made you love dogs even more. Ok what I didn't like. I'm pretty sure people thought the romance that Beka has in the story was done well, but it actually bothered me. I just knew how everything was gonna turn out, and for some reason for Beka's character I didn't think she would have let herself be so vulnerable. Then again I guess Pierce thought that it was time Beka did something other than Dog work. All I'm saying is that I think it could have been done differently or with another character. This one isn't as climactic as the first one. You know early on who is doing what and the reason given of why they did it (in my opinion) was weak. The book I think could have been 100 pages shorter. It's not that it dragged it just seemed that some of the plot that was put in there was unnecessary.Through all of that though I did really enjoy the last fourth of the book. This is where of course all the high action is and we see Beka at her best. I thought the ending left the series in a good place, and has me eagerly anticipating Mastiff.
