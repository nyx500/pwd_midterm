True to form, Tamora Pierce presents another intriguing Tortall legend and a satisfactory continuation of Beka Cooper's adventures. In her afterword, Pierce expresses doubt about the subject of counterfeit money being exciting enough for her readers. However, I found the subject engaging and timely. The description of food riots and other societal consequences of a damaged economy were appropriate topics based on the current world situation. Also, I continue to be impressed with Pierces' fictional police force and the intricate and subtle interactions between the right and wrong sides of the law.My main complaint with Bloodhound is the very unnecessary sex between Beka and Dale. I enjoy a little romance in what I read, but I felt the sex was not needed and detrimental to the story. Thankfully, Pierce's sex scenes are always merely implied (no graphic descriptions, etc.) and safe (magical birth control in place). Maybe this is to prove the point of a girl's power to choose, but for me it proves that sex before marriage cheapens a romantic relationship. Dale is a likeable and intersting character--until sex. Once he gets what he wants, he skips out of Beka's life and becomes the scoundrel playboy he didn't need to be. Also, by giving in to Dale, Beka's strong and moral character is weakened. I always appreciate some weakness in my characters, but not moral weakness. I still greatly enjoyed the story and the writing, but the intimate relationship between Beka and Dale soured some of my taste for the book.
