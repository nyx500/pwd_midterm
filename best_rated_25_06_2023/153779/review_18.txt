Overall Rating : B"Money talks and walks, but it does not bark."Another great, ridiculously detailed adventure for Beka! The story dragged on a little bit too much, but not a real deterrent. I loved every single character in the story, even the Rat Pearl Skinner(who the hell replaces teeth with pearls anyway??!?!?) I will never not love Tamora Pierce's Tortallan world.
