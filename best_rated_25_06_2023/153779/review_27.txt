I was happy to see that this book didn't suffer from the common slowness and tedium of a middle book in a trilogy, and even more happy to see that things set up in the first book carried over into this one in a natural progression. The minor jump forward in time since the previous book ended helped to avoid some of the aspects of being a Puppy that I wasn't overly fond of, and when adding in the change of locale as well, I was glad to see Beka as a new Dog with responsibilities of her own.I got used to the lack of magic in the first book, and this one was no different in that respect, but there were enough little bits throughout that it seemed magical enough all the same. I specifically like the the limitations that the magic and charms of this world have, making them reasonable while still functional. I'm all for an over-powered mage occasionally, but it's nice to know that all fantasy doesn't rely on that trope.I've heard good things about the third book for years, including how emotionally devastating it can be, so I'm both dreading and looking forward to starting that in a day or two.
