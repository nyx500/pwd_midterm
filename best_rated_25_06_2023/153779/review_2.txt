I enjoyed this a whole hell of a lot more than I did the first time I read it. I don't think I've ever reread this one, so it's been at least 13 years since I've read it. And I kinda think I enjoyed it more than book 1? Which is wild, since I LOVED Terrier (on my reread, I enjoyed it but did not love it).The full review is posted on my blog, and you can find it here: http://thesuspectedbibliophile.home.b...Get comfy. It's a long read.
