I liked this significantly more than the first book, but it's still burdened with the problems of its predecessor. The journal and the cant are both writing devices that I could do without, and in this book Beka's "fatal flaw" (shyness) is only hastily remembered when convenient. But I found the plot much more engaging, and couldn't tear myself away from the chase scenes. I really liked that this was set in a different city with its own unique history, too. This still feels like the most formulaic Pierce series I've ever read. Beka doesn't bring anything new to the table - she's a shadow copy of the far superior Kel - and that filters into the love interest, Dale, who I found charming but forgettable. (Can we talk about how they take a time-out while sitting in Pearl's court to go bang in a room at the side?? That felt a little out of character for Beka, who's on the hunt.) And it's clear Beka is still thinking about Rosto throughout the book in the back of her mind. It seems like that's being set up as an arc, but I have a hard time figuring out how that could possibly ever work. It's also weird to hear Pounce/Faithful be so explicit about his origins with so many people. I much prefer Achoo (great name) if we're rating the animal companions. I hope that whatever Pounce was doing in this book is revealed in the next.
