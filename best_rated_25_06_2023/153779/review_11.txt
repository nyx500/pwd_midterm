I don't think I was ever so excited to get my hands on an ARC (Advanced Reader's Copy) of anything more than I was to get this. I'd already been waiting years for this to come out, and even waiting a few months until the release date at the end of April was making me fidgety. I loved the first in this series and had devoured it and had been looking forward to more Beka Cooper ever since. I've been selling the first Beka Cooper novel to anybody that will listen to me ramble about how great it is, so it was a real treat for me to be able to read this early and know just how good it gets!There's always that sneaking worry that things just won't be as good as I hope them to be when I have to wait years, but this was no disappointment. Beka is definitely still my favorite Tortall heroine (which is saying a lot, I love them all!), and it was great to read more about her adventures as a Dog! I have absolutely no complaints about this--for me, it was the perfect companion to the first novel, and I loved every page of it. The time it took for this novel to be completed was well worth the wait.I don't want to spill anything about the plot here to fans that are eagerly awaiting the release in April, just know it's worth the wait and I'll definitely be out there buying this on release day so I can re-read it!
