The first book in this series is actually the very first book I read of Tamora Pierce, and that was a few years ago. At the time, I wasn’t terribly engaged with the story and didn’t pick up another book from this author until just a few months ago, when trying the Protector of the Small series. Since then, I have devoured every book of hers I can get my hands on! I have grown to love her writing style and everything about the world she has built throughout her work. So, I decided to try the Beka Cooper series again.And…. I found that after reading and understanding the world the books are set in better, I have much more appreciation for the style and set-up that drives this series. It is slower in nature than others from this author - but that is because it focuses on the methodical steps to solving crimes rather than huge fights and magics. It’s more of a police procedural/mystery wrapped up in a fantasy world. If one approaches it thus, it is a fabulous journey! Beka is a young, but world-wise and somewhat crusty, serious character who knows and has lived the harsh world of the starving and lower-class. She talks only when there is something to be said - or when her temper gets the best of her, but has a heart for justice and fairness. One truly grows to love her through this series and even more so in this story! I didn’t really like the “romantic” aspect because I thought she deserves someone so much better than who she chose. But, one does not read Tamora Pierce for romance by any stretch of the imagination (personally, I think that area is the only area that Ms. Pierce doesn’t excel at.. at all). Still, the overall is a joy to experience.
