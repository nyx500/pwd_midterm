These Beka Cooper stories are so much fun! This time, she and Clary Goodwin must track down the persons responsible for spreading counterfeit silver coins through her town and a neighbouring one, where theyâ€™re dispatched by Lord Gershom. Along for the assignment is scent hound Achoo, mistreated by her previous Dog. Beka and Clary pose as mostly harmless Dogs, while gathering information and circling ever closer to the perpetrators.Beka is stern, caring, tough, and increasingly capable, and I totally love her relationships with Goodwin and Achoo. I had no idea these stories would be so exciting and funny. I have to read the next, and continue exploring the world of Tortall.
