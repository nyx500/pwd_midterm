What I love about Beka is her insane method of dealing with trouble. Does she carefully and methodically pussyfoot her way around a problem? Oh no, she heads right directly into the source of the issue, whatever is the most dangerous, and then, when fleeing that inevitable catastrophe, she promptly heads into the next most dangerous situation, which by then, of course, has proven to be even more dangerous than the first. This is book 2 in the Beka Cooper books, but actually book 16, I believe, in the entire Tortal series. I highly recommend reading them all in order.
