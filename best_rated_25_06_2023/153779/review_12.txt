Length of time on Mt. TBR: 7 years, 5 months3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 stars I didn't like this one as much as book one - but it's still a fine YA Fantasy police procedural. WHich is exactly what it is, full stop.I did like the small comments about the cult of the Gentle Mother. As someone who started in this universe at the beginning (Alanna), I was wondering how the women Knights fell out. Especially with this series having Sabine.
