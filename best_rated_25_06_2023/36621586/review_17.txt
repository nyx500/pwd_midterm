5*****”I have plucked snowdrops at Midwinter, died at my own choosing, and wept for a nightingale. Now I am beyond prophecy.”Enchanting ! More action packed than the other two books but still maintains all of its magical elements and folklore. This book picks up straight after book 2 so we get to learn what happens of Vasya, Morozko, The Bear, Vasya’s family and Father Constantine, as well as many others. This book introduces us to more magical folklore, see Vasya use her magical skills, we get to travel to enchanted places through Midnight and meet Baba Yaga. I love Vasya as a character and she will forever be one of my most favourite and most impactful heroines I have ever come across in literature. I would love to be like her- she’s a very inspirational female character to follow. She is absolutely smart, fierce, independent, devoted, passionate and brave. She wants a life of magic instead of traditional gender roles that others are trying to box her in to. We also get to see more Vasya and Morozko and see how their interactions develop. I purely enjoyed this final instalment and it was a fantastic way of finishing the series. (I am now just forever going to reread over them as they were so good!). I am obsessed with the winternight trilogy and now that I’ve finished it I am at a loss as to what to do - I’m very sad that it is over, but it is one of the best series I have ever read. Katherine Arden has made me fall in love with the world she created and the characters she shared with us.
