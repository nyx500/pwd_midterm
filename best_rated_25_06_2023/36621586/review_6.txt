This is possibly a perfect book for me. A perfect finale, certainly. I wrote down so many quotes and I rarely care for quotes. This was the perfect culmination of so many threads and how finales should be done. Loss, learning, triumph, joy, tragedy... all in one book. Such a fulfilling conclusion. One of my favorite books of the year. I will of course be gushing about it in a review on my channel.
