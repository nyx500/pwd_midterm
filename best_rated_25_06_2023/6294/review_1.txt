I read this to my daughter, Celyn (10 at the time), who is too disabled to read books by herself.I had seen some of the anime film version years ago but remembered basically nothing of it.I found the whole thing original and refreshing. The point of view character (Sophie) is engaging and no-nonsense with a very capable can-do attitude. The story moves along at a good pace and the whole moving castle / multiple doors thing is a great idea and used well.The Welsh connection is well-played, and the continuing reveals keep everything interesting.My only complaint is that the end seemed rather tortured with so many story-lines converging in ways that felt rather unsatisfying / hard to believe. The  Miss Angorian  part, for example, seemed to come out of left-field and made very little sense to me.If I were a touch harsher then that ending would pull this down to a 4*. But Celyn loved it. I enjoyed reading it. And I'm in a good mood. So 5*!I can see why it's a classic, and if you have a 10 year old, point them at it! We may well pursue the author's other works.Edit: We've now finished the trilogy! Join my Patreon Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes........
