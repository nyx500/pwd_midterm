After finishing Howl's Moving Castle I immediately Googled “Diana Wynne Jones” to see how many more books in this series I can look forward to. The first thing I noticed was “Died: March 26, 2011”. My reaction was “WTF? And we are just getting acquainted!” The book starts off charmingly with:“In the land of Ingary, where such things as seven-league boots and cloaks of invisibility really exist, it is quite a misfortune to be born the eldest of three.” This misfortune falls on 18-year-old Sophie Hatter, who is introduced while helping her mother to make hats for selling in their hat shop*. She is feeling lonely while making these hats and talks to them like Tom Hanks talks to his volleyball, Wilson**, in the movie Castaway. Soon a witch visits her shop and promptly turns her into a very old woman (a “terrible old biddy” even) for no apparent reason. Initially accepting this ghastly state of affairs with strange equanimity (due to shock) she soon leaves her mother’s shop to find some way of lifting the curse. She ends up practically forcing Howl the wizard to take her on as his housekeeper for his “moving castle”, so-called because it is constantly roaming the country.“It was odd. As a girl, Sophie would have shriveled with embarrassment at the way she was behaving. As an old woman, she did not mind what she did or said. She found that a great relief.”They keyword for the appeal of Howl's Moving Castle is charm. I am usually reluctant to read YA books because the “Y” part of it is a (un)fairly distant memory for me, and I have had enough of books about sexy teens fighting Dystopian governments. However, I was intrigued by Studio Ghibli’s 2004 animated film adaptation. The director Hayao Miyazaki is a legend among anime fans and a spectacularly gifted artist, whose works are always brimming with unique and astounding visuals. So if he deems a book by an English author I know nothing about worth adapting then it must be something special. Howl's Moving Castle is whimsical and charming in the way that reminds me of  Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell. However, Howl’s Moving Castle is aimed at somewhat younger readership, the prose is less Austen-tatious (to coin a word) and is much shorter. It has weird, wonderful and wacky characters with amusing idiosyncrasies that stop short of being cartoonish. Beside the two central characters Sophie and Howl, I absolutely love the character “Calcifer” who is a literally fiery demon who functions in the castle as a fireplace and a cooking stove. Of course, he is already interesting by nature, but he also has wonderfully quirky personality.  The castle itself is a fascinating invention, its ability to move is not even its most remarkable feature. The front door opens to different locations, depending on the position of the colour-coded doorknob. Even that is not the weirdest thing, the interior of the castle is located in a different part of the country while simultaneously being the inside of a moving castle. The mind boggles. I have to admit that initially while reading this book I missed read something more “edgy”, adult, dark, brooding and bloody; something to satisfy my mean streak. Ah, but Diana Wynne Jones charmed me into submission, I was half in love with her by page 70. This book often brought a smile to my face and if you are looking for some way to turn that frown upside down this is just the thing._________________________* Unfortunately the word for a hat shop is not “hattery” as I had hoped but “millinery”.** Tennis ball volleyball, thanks Skip!A Word about the AnimeThe anime film adaptation is a beautiful work of art, intricately hand drawn and fluidly animated. In this age of computer animation like Toy Story and Shrek, Studio Ghibli’s beautiful, meticulous artwork is something to be treasured. As an adaptation of Diana Wynne Jones’ book, it is—in my estimation—about 60% faithful to the source material. Ms. Wynne Jones was well aware of this and heartily approved, as mentioned in an interview at the end of Howl's Moving Castle. She understood that movie is a different media and some alterations must be made. Certainly it is a very good anime, but it is substantially different from the book. There is a steampunk styling to the eponymous castle that is not in the book, and the main characters behave somewhat differently from their book counterparts, especially the antagonist “The Witch of The Waste”.Also, Miyazaki's Howl is much less flamboyant than Ms. Wynne Jones', and has a tendency to brood. The anime is much more romantic and sentimental, yet it is also darker in some instances and less comical. I don’t think the changes improve on the book, but they don’t need to. I think that you should read the book first to appreciate all the nuances. In any case, both the book and the anime are wonderful in their own ways and I am happy to own a copy of each._________________________More quotes:“Tidying up is what I’m here for!” she shouted at Howl. “Then you must think of a new meaning for your life,” Howl said.“Sophie was suddenly overwhelmed by the fact that she was standing talking to the King. It was, she thought dizzily, as if the man sitting there and the huge, important thing which was kingship were two separate things that just happened to occupy the same chair.”
