I have to say I love Hayao Miyazaki's movie better because come on, it's an awesome movie. (Although, Spirited Away is my favorite movie) There were some differences in the book but the movie was based off the book and it's not going to be the same. All that matters is they both were awesome and the author loved the movie too. I absolutely love fantasy worlds that are way out there. Happy Reading! Mel 🖤🐾🐺
