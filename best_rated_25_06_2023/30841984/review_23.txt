"Get the boss, this bunch looks like trouble."'And they do. They do look like trouble, at least until the wizard trips on a hem of his robe. He stumbles, cursing, and fouls the steps of the others as he falls face-first onto the mud-slick hillside.' ðŸ˜‚BRILLIANT. So. Damn. Brilliant.Â Alright, my mind is all over the place at the moment to write anything coherent so let me wrap this up by saying that if youâ€™re on the fence about reading this little gem - get it together and READ. IT.Â Just a little preview of what youâ€™ll get...âœ¨ A band of hilarious ageing mercenaries past their prime on their â€˜one last questâ€™ to save a loved one. And the adventures/shit they face along the way.Â âœ¨ Did I say HILARIOUS! (I canâ€™t remember the last time I laughed this hard reading a book) and charming, well-crafted characters and full of witty and delightful banter.Â âœ¨Â  A fast-moving plot with not a single boring moment and... oh the dialogue, guys! The character interactions!âœ¨Â  The number of weird-ass creatures and the many, many types of monsters youâ€™ll come across is simply something you'll just have to experience for yourself. Trust me.Â âœ¨ And MOOG! Moog is, to put it plainly, a little bundle of joy. A ray of sunshine. The sweetest, most kind-hearted character who'll kill you with laughter. My favourite one, probably on par with Clay.Â So, in a nutshell, guys,Â this's basically 0.5%/100 of what youâ€™ll get. Imagine what else is hidden inside...
