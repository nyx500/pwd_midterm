I didn't think that there could be a better dream than Chainsaw. And then this happened. My fave character gets a trilogy and trust me, the customers at the restaurant I was in when I heard know all about it (my BF was pretty confused, so OF COURSE I had to explain who was Ronan and why it was FREAKING FANTASTIC XD) *hides*
