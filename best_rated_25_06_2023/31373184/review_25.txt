September 04, 2021 The next book, you ask? Yeah.So not gonna happen.Not even Ronan Lynch has enough power to make me suffer through Mister Impossible. Especially with that title.I should reread The Raven Cycle to at least get one of my favorite series back, but it feels like this book ruined the main series for me, and I'm afraid I won't even like it anymore.March 07, 2020I'll leave my original review here just so you know how I felt when I read the last page:It's over.Fucking finally.What you have to know about me is that there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for Ronan Lynch.Including suffering through the world’s worst book. This isn’t that, of course, but what it is, is the most disappointing book of my life. More disappointing than Wayward Son. I was suffering the whole time and it took me 4 months to finish. Every time I made an eye-contact with the cover I wanted to cry and tell the hawk it's not gonna happen. But as I said, Ronan Lynch. If it wasn’t for him, I would have dnf’d it a looong time ago.Let’s start with the fact that this should have been a Ronan Trilogy. And he isn’t 🤦‍♀️ even 🤦‍♀️ the main 🤦‍♀️ character 🤦‍♀️! And why the hell fucking Farooq-Lane and Parsifal got that impossible amount of chapters when they did nothing!? Literally nothing! I mean, they quarreled all the time so yey I guess. They were boring and annoying and I wanted to shoot them in the head because they didn’t add anything to the story. They just stole the pagetime from Ronan!I knew I won't care for the story, because I didn't care about that in the previous series either. It's not a big deal, because that one didn't really have a plot, but at least there were those amazing characters. And what did we get here? I'll tell you. Fucking Farooq-Lane and Parsifal. That's what.The only thing I liked (beside the Lynch brothers) was the idea of Hennessy and her girls. That shit was interesting.Will I read the next one? Of course.Because you know:Ronan Lynch
