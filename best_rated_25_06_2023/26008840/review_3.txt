ARGHHHH CLIFFHANGERS *wails piteously*Thereâ€™s positives and negatives to getting advance copies for review: you get the story early, yes, BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO WAIT LONGER FOR THE NEXT BOOK ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ğŸ˜­ why didnâ€™t I study French in school just so I could read this series in its original language fml I am incredibly enchanted by this series. Itâ€™s so different: the worldbuilding is so unique, a blend of beauty and steampunk thatâ€™s reminiscent of Ghibli works; the writing is gorgeously translated into illustrious scenes of beauty; the storyline is just so interesting - why did the world break, who is this God figure, what really is the role of the Mirror Visitor; and the characters are such colourful creations that sometimes you hate but then you love. Argh. Not to mention the extreme slow burn romance thatâ€™s less like a slow burn and more like a slow glacier, and the Byronic hero capabilities of Mr Thorn.Though this book did feel a little bit like a filler, the ending set up some questions to leave readers grasping for the next book and UGH I just need it. And filler or no, I found the mystery really interesting and I just love these books so itâ€™s not like I could ever find them boring. Whilst it probably is closer to 4 stars, the way this world and these characters occupy my mind makes me bump it up just that little bit more.Full review to come soon!
