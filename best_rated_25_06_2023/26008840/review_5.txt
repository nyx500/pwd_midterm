I don’t know what it is about this series that keeps me feverishly tearing through pages but it’s working. I can only describe this series in question form: -I can muse perhaps that’s it’s akin to Harry Potter without being Harry Potter at all?? -It feels middle grade while not being middle grade at all? It’s just something. Something of its own. With intriguing characters. It’s not the ✨cruel-boy I enjoy hurting myself on✨ plot that I hoped for but I still love what’s going on between the two in the arranged marriage because it’s not what we all thought it’d be. And it’s weird. Quirky weird. You’ll either love it or hate it. And I’m about to spend $12 for a kindle version for book 3. So I guess that means I love it.
