Mindblowing and fascinating, I have no words. This book might be the best one I’ve read so far this year. WOW. Ce n’était pas Thorn qui avait besoin d’elle. C’était elle qui avait besoin de Thorn. Ophélie se plongea corps et âme dans le miroir.Every damn chapter has its importance. The main characters are amazing, Ophelie is just so excellent! This story is so inventive, it blows my mind. The creativity is on a Harry Potter level to me for sure. Speechless.I’m a mess full of emotions right now. That ending got me all over the place, and that cliffhanger ?! Oh my god, thankfully the third tome is out in France, I NEED IT RIGHT NOW. 5++/5 stars. Even better than Les Fiancés de l’Hiver. So glad to read in French after all this time! ❤️
