❀ 5 stars ❀Sometimes you need to own one whole day. Maybe that’s what makes you brave enough to face another.”Everything about this series is perfection. The story, the writing, the quotes, the characters, the action, the romance, I absolutely loved it all. I have no words to describe how I felt reading this, it was like the world disappeared as I was immersed in the pages. It was truly exquisite, and it became one of my favorite series.This book made up for the few problems I had with the first one, such as the lack of action-packed scenes and the confusing worldbuilding. It was very fast-paced, unlike the beginning of the first book, and the characters couldn’t catch a break, which made it more exciting and heart-breaking at the same time. The characters were very real and genuine, and they all have a special place in my heart. The writing was extremely entrancing and magical. The way the author told their story made me feel connected with them.“'Who will write our story, Jase?' 'We will, Kazi. You and I will write our own story.' And side by side, every day, that is what we do.”The romance between Kazi and Jase was so pure, touching, and beautiful. The way they are written is brilliant, two of the best main characters I’ve ever seen. “Kazi of Brightmist … you are the love I didn’t know I needed.”Reading this was a rollercoaster of emotions but it was so worth it. I’m glad they had their happy ending, and I couldn’t be more satisfied with a sequel like I am with this one. I will cherish this duology forever.
