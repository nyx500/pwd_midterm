It wasn’t quite as enthralling or impressive as the first book. The writing is still good and the plot twists are pretty surprising. I still love Kazi and Jase just as much as in the first book.However, I realized there isn’t a single LGBTQ+ character in the whole series. *stares off into the distance, shaking my head slowly*. It’s kind of disappointing, honestly. Everyone’s straight, cis, and white, which is just… not it for 2022.
