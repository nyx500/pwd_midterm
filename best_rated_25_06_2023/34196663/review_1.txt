HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE BOOK FROM THIS YEAR "Vow of Thieves" was my most anticipated release of this year and I wasn't disappointed. It was perfection. Everything that I was expecting and more. The story, the characters, the plot, the writing style, the ROMANCE...it was so good. I don't even have words to describe it. I don't know how I will recover after reading this book because my heart is torn in pieces. Mary E Pearson knows how to write a book. You should definetly go and read it. I guarantee that you'll not regret.
