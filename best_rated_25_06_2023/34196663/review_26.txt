STUNNING I’m being completely honest when I say Mary E. Pearson is one of the most underrated authors who deserve 10x the recognition she is currently receiving. Both Dance of Thieves and Vow of Thieves were both artfully thought out and I genuinely can not describe how amazing Pearson’s writing skills are. Everything to the plot from the characters were perfect. Aspiring authors and let's be honest, everyone should read this book - it will blow you away with its brilliance.
