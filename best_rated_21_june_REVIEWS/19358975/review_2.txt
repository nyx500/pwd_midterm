This seemed like a small step down from the last volume. I appreciated how our cast of characters are developing and coming into their own, especially Sophie, Gwendolyn, and Marko's mother. Also, can we talk about how Hazel and her grandmother return to Landfall at some point but not Alana? WHAT HAPPENS TO ALANA? WHAT ABOUT MY BABY MARKO? However, most of the story felt like filler as the plot wasn't moved that much further. Additionally, the illustrations weren't as detailed or vibrant as before, which was my favorite part of the subsequent volumes.I think the next volume will have a lot in store, though, and I'm excited to dive in!
