MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading ListIn this volume Alana and Marko decide they are going to go looking for the author of the romance book they read. I just love that there is a book and author in these graphic novels. CLASSIC! Grandma Klara decides she's going too! They will not leave her behind. Of course things don't go so well when they first get there as Klara gets one of her ears ate off by some bugs. Joyful! But after they find their author, he's drunk at first, they all get a long and I was hoping good things could start happening for everyone. That never happens does it....Meanwhile, The Will, Gwen, the little girl and lying cat are trapped on a planet that if you eat the fruit you will have hallucinations that make you want to stay there. Yeah, that all sucked pretty bad. The Will almost dies during these hallucinations so Gwen hurries them off to find Marko to see if he can heal The Will as she has feelings for him. <---she's just not showing it. So all of these peeps show up at the author's pad and havoc is reeked! Oh and this guy/tv head. â†“He gets his clock ticked for a bit. You have a show down with Marko, Gwen and Alana. Crap goes all to hell and everyone runs off on different missions. I can't say any more. I can't wait to see what all kinds of cray cray is going to go on in the next one. I'm trying to read them slowly as I have the newest one on pre-order :-D Yay! The little picture at the end where it shows Hazel walking is precious!
