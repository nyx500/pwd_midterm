Of the 3 volumes of SAGA I've read so far, I think this one might be my favorite. Okay, that's largely because it featured a writer and I'm a bit partial to them...but I felt that action-wise, it was just especially well done. All of the cliff hangers and plot points that were introduced in volume 2 are now coming into fruition and it's so much fun! Can't wait to get to volume 4! I've written reviews on volumes 1 + 2 as well if you're interested in more in-depth thoughts. WEBSITE | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM
