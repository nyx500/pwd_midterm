"Because the opposite of war...is fucking."Seriously, rn I think there's no other sidekick in the literature that I love more than the Lying Cat. I love her and I hope nothing happens to, because then I will cry for days. This animal is going to end my life...â™¡  Also, I've found this volume a little bit less interesting than the first two, but, OF COURSE, I will continue with the series.   Review coming soon...
