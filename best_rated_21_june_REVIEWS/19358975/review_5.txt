Third time reading, and I still can't get over so much of this - Klara's friendship with Heist; the non-linear narration which is yet pitch perfect; the kick-ass-ness of Gwendolyn and how her character and actions just can't be guessed - such a genuine and multi-faceted character. And of course, the damn fine cup of artwork! Volume three and still gong extremely strong and on top of all that Fiona Staples' art is, in case I forgot to mention it before, is peerless. 10 out of 12. Five Star Read.
