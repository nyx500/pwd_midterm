The Saga series is created by Hugo Award winners Brian K. Vaughan (writer) and Fiona Staples (artwork)Three books in and I’m still loving this series of graphic novels. These glossy tomes are sharp, funny and madly inventive, and they brighten up a lockdown coffee break (and my bookshelves)I’m beginning to get quite attached to the central characters, Elana and Marko, our star crossed lovers and their baby, Hazel (sometime narrator) as they flee assassins, reporters and ex partners.As explained in the previous instalment they are accompanied by Marko’s acid tongued mother and floating Izabel, the sweet, teenaged ghost as she trails entrails and babysits Hazel.The union between Elana and Marko, between the winged and horned ones, is seen as an affront to decency and high treason by their respective warring worlds. Nobody wants the family acknowledged or even found alive.Along the way we visit some new, colourful planets, meet a one eyed author who lives in a cosmic lighthouse, witness a blood fest as characters eat psychosis inducing fruit, duck as a deeply untrustworthy special agent flies in (literally) and panic a little as King IV (the screen head) gets a little too close to our unlikely ragtag family.Great fun, quite adult and a must for anybody who wants to intersperse their serious reading with something a little less serious.My reviews for the earlier books:Saga, Vol.1Saga, Vol.2
