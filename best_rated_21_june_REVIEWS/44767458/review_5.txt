If you are having a hard time reading Dune:https://youtu.be/UMTRoZNN4E0My YouTube Review (admittedly totally Fangirling):https://youtu.be/JilubCWr9KkThis was one of the best books that I have ever read which I was not expecting at all. First, the book is incredibly put together and really well thought out. Often, the author wrote the book in such a way as you can hear the character's thoughts which was a really interesting perspective and provided a more immersive experience.The book touches on so many different deep topics and is so inspiring, moving. The book was also so unpredictable and unique. Highly recommend.2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jonesâ€™s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta
