Nope. Sorry I don't get it.I was able to finish it by listening to the audiobook but I was bored throughout the whole 21h.So many descriptions... anyone else found the way Paul's mom describing him kinda weird?And let's not even mention how many times I laughed at the main female character being called Jessica.I'm sure I'll get plenty of comments telling me it's a classic and it brought so much to the genre... At the end of the day, my rating is always based on my enjoyment.
