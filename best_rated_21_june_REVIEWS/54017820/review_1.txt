ive never heard of ‘the goose girl,’ so i have no idea how this compares as a retelling, but i do appreciate the unique story. i feel like the same tales get retold and retold, so its nice to read something new, even if im not familiar with the source material. overall, i think this is a fine story. i didnt fall head over heels in love with it, but its definitely far from terrible. i like the atmosphere of the story - it has very woodsy, german village, dark fairytale vibes. i also really enjoyed the use of an anti-hero and found vanya to be a compelling character.the things that prevented me from enjoying this more were the slow pacing and long length. the plot and writing are also pretty simple, so combine all of these and it just makes the story feel drawn out and sometimes a chore to read. but all in all, this would be the perfect book for someone who is looking for a fresh retelling that promises some interesting magic, world-building, and mystery.thanks so much for the ARC, macmillan/henry holt and co!↠ 3 stars
