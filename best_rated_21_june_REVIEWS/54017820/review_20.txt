Rating 2 DNF @40% *Sigh* I really, really wanted to like this book. This book has such a gorgeous cover that immediately piqued my interest. After reading the synopsis I was even more excited to read this story. Unfortunately, that’s where all of the excitement comes to an end for me. I tried giving this book three attempts and still I couldn’t get into it. The writing seemed to be all over the place and almost seemed too rushed. While I love a strong female main character she was not at all likable. I found myself rolling my eyes and I had no interest in what would happen to her. As far as plot goes there were too many good ideas instead of just having one overall great idea. Even though this book wasn’t for me I can see how others might enjoy it.  **Received an advanced copy through NetGalley in return for my honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own. **
