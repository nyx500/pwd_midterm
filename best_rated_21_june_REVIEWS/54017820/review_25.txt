Loved it! Bespelled jewellery, nightmare horse demons, a world of low gods and high gods, and an Evil Baddie. Vanya is our underdog MC and is joined by a bunch of misfits to solve a crime and save a kingdom. Special mention to the shapeshifting Goddessâ€™ daughter and the Kobald, the palace goblin. This was a fantastic and romantic tale which was just perfect for the shorter darker days of winter. Many thanks to Netgalley for an arc of this book.
