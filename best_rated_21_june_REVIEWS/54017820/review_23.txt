EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK. AND I GENUINELY MEAN EVERYONE.Little Thieves is everything you could ever want in a fantasy book. Our heroine, Vanja, is sharp, quick-witted, and so much fun to read about. She is constantly scheming and getting into trouble. Every other character is basically yelling, "VANJA NO" and she is like "Vanja, hell yes." When her greed gets in her trouble, she must find a way to break the curse placed on her by a surly god.The plot, characters, and the world were all phenomenal. I was never bored and was so sad when the journey ended. I cannot wait to get more adventures with Vanja in Painted Devils!
