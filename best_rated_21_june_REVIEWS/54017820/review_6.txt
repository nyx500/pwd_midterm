4 ⭐This was really good!! 🤩🤩 Such a great fairytale retelling and so many aspects were right up my alley. I had a great time reading it! 💗💗“Once upon a time, there was a girl as cunning as the fox in winter, as hungry as the wolf at first frost, and as cold as the icy wind that kept them at each other's throats. Her name was not Gisele, nor was it Marthe, nor even Pfennigeist. My name was -is- Vanja. And this is the story of how I got caught.”Little Thieves is a retelling of the Goose Girl- but from the villain's pov. Vanja is the goddaughter of Death and Fortune, working as a palace maid for Princess Gisele. But when her godmothers demand payment for their care and the horrible treatment from the royals she is employed by gets too awful to handle, she decides to take her future into her own hands. Posing as Gisele with a magical item and leaving the real Gisele penniless, Vanja starts stealing from the nobles for her debt as she plots her revenge. But now that there is a curse, a terrible scheme and an awfully handsome boy in the mix, Vanja's life is about to be thrown into chaos...“There's a saying in the Blessed Empire: Little thieves steal gold, and great ones steal Kingdoms, but only one goes to the gallows. I'm not sure I agree. I've little interest in kingdoms, but even less in dancing with the hangman. And I've gotten very good - great, you might even say - at stealing gold.”I've been eyeing this book for a while bc it sounded really interesting AND had a gorgeous cover. However, I never picked it up initially and so I'm really glad I finally got to it!! And it ended up being a really entertaining read 🥰🥰Starting with the characters! ... which was actually one of my main issues with the book 😬😬 They weren't awful but they definitely didn't impress me that much. While the mc, Vanja, was very fierce and morally grey (2 things I love), I never really connected to her character and found it difficult to root for her. She made some REALLY stupid decisions and had me facepalming a lot 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🙄🙄 Like, there were aspects of her character I liked, but she was just so FRUSTRATING. I do also think the side characters lacked development and weren't amazing either.HOWEVER, I did really like Emeric! 😍😍 He was super sweet and wholesome and i just really connected to him. He came off a bit boring and snobbish at the beginning, but as the book progressed, i really grew to appreciate his character. He's really 'nerdy' and quiet, but his development was done really well & i liked him a lot ❤However, the writing and plot were much better than the characters!! ✨ I really liked Margaret Owen's writing, it was really easy to read and gave the book a great atmosphere. All the dark fairytale vibes were there and i LOVED that. Also, the inclusion of German culture in this book was really really interesting and made the world feel very developed! 🥰🥰The plot was enjoyable as well- it had a really interesting storyline with quite a bit of action. I loved the twist the author put on the Goose Girl fairytale and there was a fun little mystery with a great solution. The book also wrapped up really well with a sweet ending 💗My only critique with the plot tho was that the middle had a serious lack of action and lost my interest at times. The beginning and ending were both great, but I think the middle just needed to be sped up a bit 🙁There was also a small little romance subplot- and I liked it way more than I thought I would?! 🤭🤭 Emeric and Vanja were a great couple- there was a lot of chemistry and their connection just felt really REAL 🥰 It was not forced at all. They both had baggage but helped each other work through it and supported each other- which is exactly what a relationship should look like!! 😍😍 It was just a genuinely healthy and sweet romance that was a nice break from the usual darker romance in fantasy books 💗💗“I can't say if you're a good person or not. But the more I know of you, the more I understand that the world keeps making you choose between survival and martyrdom. No one should fault you for wanting to live.”Overall, a really great read!! 🤩🤩 Would recommend if you're looking for:✔ Great fairytale retelling✔ Morally grey mc✔ All the good dark fairytale vibes✔ Sweet romance subplotIt was a really enjoyable read to start off the month 💗💗《 2023 challenge: Book 70 of 110 》~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I really enjoyed this!! 🥰🥰 It gave all the good dark fairytale vibes AND it had a really cute romance 💗💗RTC!
