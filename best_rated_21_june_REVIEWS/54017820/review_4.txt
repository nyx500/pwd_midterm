My pitch: kind of like Six of Crows, only set in medieval Germany with traditional German fae folk. My not-so-coherent thoughts: This book!!!! Is probably one of my favorites for this year! I LOVE the demi rep and the characters! Vanja is most definitely not a morally good character, but she is written so well. I bawled about 3/4 of the way through the book and didn’t stop until the end. I love the German too— I never see any medieval German settings done well in books!GIVE ME THE NEXT BOOK!
