I don’t how or when it happened but this book snuck up on me and I absolutely loved it. It reminded me of everything I used to love about YA fantasy.Vanja is not good, nor is she bad. She is a product of her circumstances and is hellbent on survival no matter the cost. Some of her thoughts and reasoning were so deeply relatable that I couldn’t help but love her and root for her. Protect vanja at all cost. I love the worldbuilding, the ways the gods are portrayed as well as how hinged on human emotions everything is. It makes everything so easy to grasp and understand in ways that I didn’t expect. I understood every single character’s motivations even if I often disagreed with them. That’s how you know a book is damn good. I also adored the romance unfolded and was developed, i was rooting for them so hard. Dislike to love excellence. The writing was also stunning, i underlined so many quotes and so much of it felt like a punch in the gut. Especially when vanja was talking about her loneliness, how unlovable and expendable she thought she was and how she had no one but herself. Babygirl needed a hug. Or a hundred. And as such seeing her open herself up was such a beautiful thing to witness. Aside from the emotional parts, i loved how sharp and witty vanja’s voice was, it’s so effortlessly entertaining and engaging, funny in many places. The plot and mystery were also smart and kept me wanting for more, seeing how the next step unfolds.The queerness and found family aspects were so unexpected but an absolute win for me. Two of my absolute favorite things. The MC and her love interest are both demi, and two of the major side characters are sapphic. Having gone into the book thinking it very non-queer, I was absolutely delighted.
