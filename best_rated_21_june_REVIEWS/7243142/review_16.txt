{December 19th, 2014} MINI-REVIEW4 to 4.5 stars, I want MOAR.“Try as we might to postpone them, days of reckoning inevitably arrive.”Well this was certainly quite the ride. Everything really managed to be covered in almost 600 pages and in a smooth way to almost. I'm surprised how much work went into this final book. After the last book, I was wondering how it would hold up. Thankfully I was surprised again, especially since I finished this within less a day. Pretty insane, huh?Now what to say about this final installment that probably hasn't been said?The final chapter was a troll ending response from the author, had me going NOOO I WANT MOAR FABLEHAVEN though lmao. But that's the thing about good series, you're supposed feel that way by the end. I'm glad I stuck with this series despite my first thoughts and impressions.I do hope Mull returns to this world in some form, it really is sound and magical.“Some imagine the difference between heaven and hell to be a matter of geography. Not so. The difference is much more evident in the individuals who dwell there.”
