I had to stay up until 4 A.M. it was way too exciting to put it down. I even loved the end of the book, end of the series. I didn't think "thank heaven's it's over," like I have with others. Their was a lot of comic relief. At the every end of the book, Brandon mentions that he might do more with the characters, but it will be with a complete different series. I would like to see that happen. The Characters are fun and very likable. It would be smart to start a completely different series if he would do more with these particular characters. I've got my mother hooked on the series. She got so frustrated with Seth's character, and she almost through a couple of my books. I looked as Seth's character just as a normal brother. Lets face it, natural boy curiosity; if one of my brothers had the same choices, they would do the same thing. Thank you Brandon Mull for letting me be part of your journey though Fableheaven. It was fun.
