Brandon Mull is simply a wonderful writer. If I had kids, I'd MAKE them read this series. All the other rave reviews are right on, and written by more talented reviewers than myself. I will add two points. First, I really like how Mr Mull weaves in little "life lessons," quite directly but without being preachy. And, Mr. Mull, if you really are contemplating writing more Fabelhaven-related books, I would love to see more of Doren and Newel! I haven't laughed out loud at dialogue in a book in a very long time.
