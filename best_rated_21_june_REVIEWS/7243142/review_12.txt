This last book in the Fablehaven series  was Is EverythingI Laughed, Cried. Cheered and Fell in Love, whilst reading this Gem. I did not want this to end. I wanted more, so much more. The plot twist was believable and enjoyable, the characters ( new and old ) were Amazing and the action and suspense was most certainly, a Euphoric Experience.I Love these Memorable Characters Immensely. Middle Grade book my Ass, this read is for any and all age groups. 10 ~ I'm sad that is over, but feel honored that I experience it ~ Stars
