And here's another book which broke my soul. There's only another one book which I would not recommend even though I gave it all the freaking complete full stars of the reading galaxy aka A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. The only difference between these two books is that this A Monster Calls is really short. But the effect of both is the same : devastating.And I am so afraid of the moment I have to face the same situation in my real life one day.And this is really breaking my heart.I cannot stop grieving.I cannot believe this middle grade, fantasy-paranormal short fiction would have this effect on me.And believe me I really do not want to recommend anyone this book unless it is really required.This book has the story of a boy who is struggling through a rough time of a family member with a terminal illness. There's more to this story. The monster is by far my most favourite character. Another character, Lily, is one of those characters who you love and then hate and then love. And yes, this one has one of the most unlikeable father characters I have across but again, reality check: I really cannot hate this character too. I wish the character of the grandmother was a little more developed. But things worked out perfectly in breaking my heart. My head is a mess right now and I am so going to fall sick. I am still grieving.
