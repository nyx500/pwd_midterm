TEAR JERKER ALERT!TEAR JERKER ALERT!OMG, I’m a 40-plus-year-old DUDE and I almost lost it a couple of times.There is not always a happy ending. I know this, we all know this, in life as in fiction. Hell, I even welcome it sometimes and give a “meh” to too cheesy a Hollywood ending or even a thumbs down to a deus ex machina. As any reader of Cormac McCarthy knows, sometimes the best ending is not the one that leaves us all warm and fuzzy.Patrick Ness’s 2011 short novel was based on a concept from Siobhan Dowd, who died of cancer in 2007 at the age of 47, way way too soon. In this young adult novel (but also for the rest of us) young Conor O’Malley is dealing with the terminal illness of his single mother. As if that is not bad enough, he’s getting picked on at school. Then a monster “comes walking” and things get interesting.Ness keeps the syrup on the table but tells this somber fantasy straight and it works. The characterization is real and the dialogue is what you expect in real life. The drawing of the monster was also excellent, casting from ancient myth, legend and from psychological elements to create a fantastic but believable relationship between Conor and the monster who always shows up at the same time.Highly recommended but keep the tissue paper in reach.
