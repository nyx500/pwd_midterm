“Stories are wild creatures, the monster said. When you let them loose, who knows what havoc they might wreak?”When a monster shows up and talks with 13-year old Conor in Patrick Ness’s A Monster Calls, the question behind why it has ‘come walking’ immediately arises. Has it appeared to do mischief to Conor or has Conor summoned it and, if so, summoned it to do what? The writing, especially when the monster is around, evokes dreams, faraway lands and ancient creatures. As soon as the monster begins to relate a set of stories, even though I liked the stories, A Monster Calls, along with the issues Conor is dealing with away from the monster, becomes very predictable. 3.5 stars; I enjoyed this quick read, but wanted something more so (unfortunately) I’m rounding down.
