“Who am I?” The monster repeated. “I am the spine the mountains hang upon! I am the tears the rivers cry! I am the lungs that breathe the wind!...I am everything untamed and untameable! I am this wild earth, come for you Conor O’Malley.” I enjoyed this tale, though I have to admit I wasn’t as blown away as the masses of other reviewers seemed to be. I’ve read a lot of books on tough topics, including illness and while I believe this one was done very well it didn’t stand out from among many others. However, I thoroughly enjoyed Ness’s approach to his subject. Conor, a young boy whose mother is terminally ill, is visited by a monster every night at 12.07. This monster is to tell Conor three stories, and at the end of these stories Conor will tell his own.  “I do not often come walking, boy....only for matters of life and death. I expect to be listened to.” The stories were very good I found. The focus on human nature and how every person is complex. The person you may think is the villain may not actually be as evil as you first thought, and the one you thought a hero may actually have done some dark deeds.  “There is not always a good guy. Nor is there always a bad one. Most people are somewhere in between.” Conor’s struggles with his mother’s illness, his dislike of his grandmother, troubles at school and a brief visit from his absent father all make the situation very real and difficult. Overall, a quick and enjoyable read and I will be giving some of Patrick Ness’s other works a go! “It was not that he was actually invisible...it was that people had become used to not seeing him...and if no one sees you...are you really there at all?”
