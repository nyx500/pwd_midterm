i think this is honestly the best book about grief and coping that i have ever read. it was a wonderfully imaginative and truly insightful story. i love how it expressed such a tender subject in a really wild, but gentle, way. i wish i had half the creativity and story-telling ability that patrick ness has. i cant believe such a powerful message was held within such a tiny book. it just goes to show that you dont need a lot of words to impact someone if they are the right words. â†  5 stars
