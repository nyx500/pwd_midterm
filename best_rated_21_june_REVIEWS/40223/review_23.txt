Who would have thought that after 2600 pages, this series would finally get to me? But  “I know this to be true”: There were definitively 5 stars sections in  Kushiel's Avatar  the final book of  Phèdre's Trilogy . The writing was much improved: less sex and a clear red thread – oh and how I loved how  they all healed and became a family!  The author really understands how relationships work and did this very well! She also went to some very dark places in this book, hard to bear, but overall, it was well done. “Tis a dangerous force, this love.” But alas, there were also these endless filler-pages, naming countless peers, their clothes and alliances that I mostly skimmed. So, I remain torn. Despite myself I started to fall in love with these characters and especially Imri about whom the next series is about. In the end, I decided to not continue, I can already guess the next happenings  Imri falling in love with Ysandre’s daughter and something to do with Melisande  and while I’m sure, that the author will move me with her words, she just uses too many of them – unnecessarily in my opinion. Still, I think I will look back fondly on these books and how the concept of love might be stronger than any magic. Overall, 3.5 stars, rounded up! Mayhap, I can start again during retirement, at one point in life there should be more time, no?
