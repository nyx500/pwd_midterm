I gotta say, this was one of the most all-around satisfying conclusions to any series I've read. Not a word too many, nor too few. So many authors rush the final pages of a series, and I'm happy to say that Carey doesn't. What started as a reading experiment in broadening my reading tastes with Kushiel's Dart has ended in a journey that felt longer than its 3 novels, which is a testament to the writing skill of Jacqueline Carey. Great characters, interesting semi-historical world, and riveting plot throughout.
