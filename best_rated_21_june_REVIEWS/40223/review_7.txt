Kushiel’s Avatar is the last book in the first of three Kushiel’s Universe trilogies. All three books were a solid four stars. I enjoyed the stories, cared about the characters, and looked forward to reading it each day. I didn’t find it very hard to put down, and there were slow spots here and there, so that’s the main reason I’m sticking with four stars.I think the amount of sex scenes decreased as the series went on, but I would caution that there is some pretty major violence in this third book, at least during one section of it. This included (general spoiler, not specific) violence against children and rape of children, although that part took place mostly off the page and was difficult to read, although the story itself was very riveting for me in that section. I did think the author did a good job of showing the long-term impact those experiences had on the characters.This book gave the trilogy a satisfying conclusion, tying up the most significant plot threads while leaving room for the reader to wonder what the characters might do next. I’m really looking forward to the next trilogy, which is listed as Imriel’s Trilogy. We spent quite a bit of time with Imriel in this book and I really liked him, so I look forward to reading more about him.
