4.75*Finally we've reached the end of this journey... while already teasing the next one.This is the last Kushiel's Legacy book narrated through Phèdre's eyes. But this was an amazing final ride with her.Phèdre is one of the strongest protagonists I ever read about and her and Joscelin are THE f/m OTP... and then there's this tiny new addition to this book that you can't help falling in love with. And then there all the obvious hits with a Carey book, means gorgeous writing, well researched history that's then smartly twisted, great characters and tension that inables your hands from letting go of your book.I have to say, in the last third of the book dragged just a tiny bit. But then there is the finale, which left me crying in the middle of the night.And while I know it'll take some time until I'm ready for the next trilogy, it sure won't be too long.
