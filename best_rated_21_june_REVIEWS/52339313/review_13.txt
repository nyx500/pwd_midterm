*3.75üåüBuddy read with Drama QueenHow I expected that this book will endHow it actually endedI mean don't get me wrong...I LOVED the bookBUT I just expected an emotional readThe book was fluffy and cute!!(Not complaining)But it felt like WE (Joshita and Mrin) were chilling with the characters xDThis book had a "chill" vibe going on..as against to the "spooky" vibeThe premise was pretty simple:The MC summons a ghost and is not able to get rid of the said ghostThats all I will say...Go into this book without knowing anything elsejust enjoy the cool vibes of the bookAs my buddy read partner said at the very beginning of the book... THIS BOOK HAS COCO VIBES!!!!And she was right!!! Coco is one of my all time fav movie & this book reminded me a LOT about that book!!(I bawled like a baby during this scene ü•∫üò≠)Another thing which I ADORED in this book is the family aspectThey had a close knitted family which I appreciated VERY MUCH!!For me family is very important...I mean I am Indian ...so I basically grew up with the teaching that family comes first ...ALWAYS(Idk how to translate this‚òù I just know my family is gonna kill me after they see this memeüòÇif you know the translations please do tell)And I guess I related to Yadriel in that aspectHe was close to his cousin#relatablehad a big ass family#relatablethe said family is nosy BUT Loving at the same time#relatableI mean it was great seeing a FAMILY for once in YA novels xDStuff like this NEVER happens in YA novels!!Now the characters Shall I say this book has some of the MOST amazing characters ??!!They will be going to the list of my all time fav book characters !!Especially Julian and Maritza !!Julian was like my twin brother(?)I mean now I know how I would be as a GhostCause Julian represented me xDHe was loud and irritating and loved playing pranksüòÇIf I died and I was turned into a ghost..even I would have the same reactions as he did!!He was an extrovert who got hold of an introvert And now the said introvert is not able to get rid of him(My life summed in 2 lines lol)But yeah you should read this book at least for him (I am NOT bragging about myself...ok maybe just a littleüòÇüòÖ)The fact that Julain was a Scorpio was cherry on the cake!!I am Cancer and get very well along with Scorpios xDWater signs need to stick together lolOk now the other character whom I loved was the MC's cousin MaritzaNow here's the thing...I have a friend whose name is also MariAnd both the Mari (Yadriel's aka the MC's Mari and Mrin's Mari) are the people whom you run for help when you are in trouble üòÇlike trust me ...we all need a Mari in our lifeThat one cousin who wont judge us for our wierdness & will have our backThe only difference is Mari is not my cousin (But I do consider her as one now xD)The characters are just so relatable!! You wont be disappointed in them!!My only complaint of this book is that the Main character Yadriel did not feel fleshed outI wanted more character depthSame goes for the plot lineIt was really slow pacedI personally feel that there was so much scope for world building and magic systemThis was low fantasy BUT I am someone who enjoys good world buildingThe author did not explain the magic system wellI was honestly left with so many qts!!Awww look at the cute owl!!ü•∫But those were my only complaints !!Really enjoyed this book and most importantly enjoyed the BR with the crazy woman xDI swear we were being OTT dramatic for more than half part of the discussion lolMrin:Joshita:Mrin:Joshita:that's how this be wentUpdate 1Mature Mrin: NO FANTASY!!! TRY DIFFERENT GENRES!!!Normal Mrin: But...Mature Mrin : NO But Wut!!Normal Mrin: *Snickers*
