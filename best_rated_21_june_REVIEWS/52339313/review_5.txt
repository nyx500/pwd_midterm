Click the booktube link to check out my favorite PRIDE booksThe Written ReviewOh my gosh. Can I rate this more than 5 stars???I cannot even BEGIN to talk about how BRILLIANT this one was.I was hooked from the start - the way Aiden set up the characters and the Brujx world was so intriguing and exciting.The plot felt so unique and fresh - I literally read this in a single night and was devastated there wasn't more. I absolutely loved, loved, loved Yadriel and his struggles were so perfectly shown. The way his dad struggled with coming to terms with Yadriel's true self was so heart-achingly real. I also adored Julian - and I'm normally the type to roll my eyes at characters like this in YA. And yet, it worked so well for him. He really embraced himself and did a fabulous job of giving the book some much-needed spunk.The two characters clicked together right from the start and kept that momentum going. They played off of each other so well and honestly carried the book to new heights.I cannot wait for this one to be published and for more people to read it!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads
