When a book has you crying at 5% in, you know it's going to hit hard.Cemetery Boys was one of my most anticipated releases of 2020. I've been desperate to read it for months. So even though I'd preordered a book box with the book, I couldn't wait for it to arrive and purchased the ebook so I could start it on release day. And I have zero regrets, because as high as my expectations were, this book lived up to them perfectly.I firmly believe this will be a new comfort read for me, one I'll reread again and again when in need of comforting, and that's honestly the highest praise I can give any book. It's this perfect fantasy with a contemporary feel, full of funny moments but also full of hard-hitting ones. Overall, I found it a rather fluffy fantasy, but it does have its impactful moments, and I thought it had a really great balance between romcom aspects and more impactful ones.Yadriel and Julian have my absolute favourite dynamic, and it was consistently there from the moment they met. Julian just... will not shut up, and Yads has had this long-suffering weariness from the minute they met. Both of these characters are characters you can't help but love, and their relationship is so special to me, because they both have these reasons to believe they're not worthy of (romantic) love and it's wonderful to see them proving each other wrong. Because they're both so incredibly loveable, and they deserve the world.The trans rep was honestly... so incredibly special to me as well. I already cried twice during the first two chapters, because I felt so seen in some really difficult struggles. And it was just amazing to see how this book does deal with transphobia in Yadriel's day to day life, but in a way that never makes this a heavy book to read, which means it's such a safe space to process and engage with these issues.
