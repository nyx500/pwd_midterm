That's pretty remarkable. And a pleasure to read. And there's fighting and assassination attempts, as well as court life, dancing, music, popular songs, and quite a bit about architecture. At least part of my fascination is what it would be like to live with gods actually showing up and performing the odd miracle. The story is mostly focused on Costis, a decent career soldier in the Queen's guard, young, who gets caught up in the events of the beginning of the king's reign. And while it isn't history, there is much historical basis. Good stuff. I'm quite smitten with Eugenides, not that I would be married to him for anything.Library copy.
