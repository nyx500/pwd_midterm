4/5 StarsSometimes, if you want to change a man’s mind, you change the mind of the man next to him first.”  The Skinny:  Gen has gotten what he ‘wanted’; he is now the King of Attolia. It quickly becomes evident that while Gen got something he desired, that something was not to rule a Kingdom of people. Thrown into a life where the majority of his subjects despise him, Gen must try to come into his own. It appears as though Gen is royally sinking in his attempt to rule, but as is always the case with the thief, things are never what they appear. The Review:Unlike in The Thief, The King of Attolia is not told from Gen’s point of view. This story focuses primarily on Costis, a member of the Attolian guard. Gen is still very much a part of this story, but Costis really takes center stage. It was interesting to see many of Gen’s interactions and schemes from more of an ‘outsiders’ point of view. I found myself on the edge of my seat, because it was harder to discern what Gen was thinking and what his plans were because I was ‘not in his head’. At times this was also aggravating because I was wondering why the hell he was saying/doing certain things. Costis, one of the main characters in this book, was not really likable at first. I can attribute this 100% to the fact that he did not like Gen (whatever, people!) I suppose he cannot really be blamed for disliking the king, because Gen acted pretty damn foolish for a good portion of the book (always whining, falling asleep during meetings, and such). But as I got to know Costis as a character, he began to grow on me. Where everyone else took Gen’s silly behavior at face value, Costis began to see the gaps. By the end, Costis was unflinchingly loyal to the king and he had redeemed himself in my eyes. Because you’re a jumped-up barbarian goatfoot who abducted the Queen of Attolia and forced her to accept you as a husband and you have no right to be king, was Costis’s thought. Aloud, he said, “I don’t know, Your Majesty.”Gen, ohhhh Gen. Like I stated previously, Gen frustrated me in this novel. At times I was left wondering why he was acting like such a dunce. Without giving too much away ��� I should have realized that Gen always has something up his sleeve (I SWEAR I’m not making a handless joke…*wink*).The true beauty of this story, besides the twists and turns which are always top-notch, is the evolution of the relationships between characters. There is a huge change in the relationship between Costis and Gen. It was such a slow transformation between the two, that I can’t exactly say what the actual turning point was. I just know that it was very fulfilling to see the pair go from hatred to something else. There was also a deepening marriage between Attolia and Gen. Their relationship might go down as one of my favorite romances because of the simple understanding they created between one another. Attolia understood Gen and he got her. I don’t really know how else to describe it. Lastly, the development of Gen’s subejcts feelings towards him was drawn out, yet amazing. I wanted to laugh at all of them by the end of the story. How could they have doubted the beloved Gen?! It was a kiss between a man and his wife, and when it was over, the king closed his eyes and rested his forehead against the hollow of the queen’s shoulder, like a man seeking respite, like a man reaching home at the end of the day.Overall: This is a definite thinker of a book. Little things that appear inconsequential at first, end up leading to, or being, bigger things. While not full of fast-paced action, this story holds its own because of the development of the characters and the intricate plot.
