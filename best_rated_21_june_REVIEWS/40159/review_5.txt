That scene, with Eugenides bleeding almost to death all while pretending he was okay, yet taking time to show his love for Attolia..... that bit right there is why I LOVED this book. I swoon. Sigh Admittedly, I did not see it coming. That I would be entranced by these characters. Gen and Attolia's love and marriage hit me in the "feels", while the palace intrigue and political machinations had me at the edge of my seat. Alas and as with all good things, the end has come. *Sniff.*Thank you, Megan Whalen Turner, for writing such a phenomenal series.
