UPDATE 5/2022: Iâ€™m just incredibly obsessed with this couple and I continually reread their sections, so I decided this deserved a boost to 5 star famedom.~~~The romance in this book? Exceptional. I loved it. The King of Attolia thrilled me and was definitely the best book in the series. I loved everything in this book, from the political intrigue to the romance and swordplay and trickery. Thanks MWT!
