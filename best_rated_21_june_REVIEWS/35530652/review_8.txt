While Red Sister was a slow burn that was well worth its pace, Grey Sister has ascended to all new highs for the Book Of The Ancestor series. One thing I failed to speak on full in my full review (https://youtu.be/aJPs1Uv0KpE), is how creative of a world is being crafted here as well. It seems ever possible element of this story is being masterfully worked to draw the reader into this dying world as deeply as possible.
