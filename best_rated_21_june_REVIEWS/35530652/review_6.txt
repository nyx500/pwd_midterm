All the goddamn stars!This was some of the best authoring I've ever seen.If you had any idea how lazy I've become with books that don't have pictures, then you would realize how unbelievable it was that I couldn't put this one down. As it is, you'll just have to take my word for it. I'm lazy. This was unputdownable.The Sisters of Sweet Mercy are back and they are kicking ass in their own various ways all over the place! I loved all the Sisters and novices at the convent (minus one or two, of course!), but this time around you really get to know what makes a few of them tick. Glass & Kettle are a-mazing!Of course, the story revolves around Nona, but you grow to love all the characters even more than you originally did. Even some of the ones that aren't strictly good...kinda like Nona herself. Bless her little heart for trying, though.Ok, I'm not going to ruin anything by talking about all the different plotlines, but it was full of action, twists, and Nona's unwavering loyalty to her friends. I cannot WAIT till the next book drops!Oh, and I have to send out a HUGE thanks to Mr. Lawrence for including those first few pages of incredibly helpful reminders from the last book for those of us who don't remember stuff so well anymore. <--That, dear sir, was very nice of you.
