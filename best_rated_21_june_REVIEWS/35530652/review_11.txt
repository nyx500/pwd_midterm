3.75 StarsThis book is pretty much exactly like the first book in the way it played out for me...The first half was a trudge-fest and I borderline questioned why I was still even reading it...and then the second half made it all clear.I am hesitant to talk too much outside of broad generalities here as I don't want to spoil anything that occurred in either this book or book one, so I will just say that I love Abbess Glass most of all. I love her wily machinations and the way she truly does care about her girls in the end.  I also still really love Nona and her dedication to and belief in the bonds of friendship. I will definitely be finishing this series as 1) I want to know how it ends, duh, and 2) I want to read the series about the ice folk (Zole's people) that I hear Lawrence will be releasing in the upcoming future.
