This was a really good book. On its surface it is a great story about a young boy who goes through tremendous struggles. On another level it is a brilliant psychological character study and an observation of group dynamics. On still another level it was an intelligent allegory for violence and bellicosity in ourselves and our society. There is a listopia list that calls this the best science fiction novel. Mmmmm, maybe. I can see why someone would say so. I have heard where military organizations have assigned this for cadet reading.It is very good, certainly high in the running and on a short list of best ever. I will read more by Card and may read more of the Ender series.
