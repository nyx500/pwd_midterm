Brings me back to my childhood days of playing various jrpgs like Final Fantasy 7 and Tales of Symphonia (I still play them, but the childhood nostalgia was worth mentioning.) The plot and setting is as simplistic as fantasy can get, and that's not a bad thing by any means as it takes pride in its simplicity and utilizes it to the best of its ability. The plot is predictable but the action, character exchanges and little bits of philosophy and politics are entertaining enough to continue reading through to the end. I appreciated Drizzt as the underdog protagonist, the guy that sees things differently than everyone else and wants to make some serious changes to his depraved and crooked society. I also enjoyed his master-student bond with his teacher Zaknafein, the ending to their relationship was definitely tragic but it served in fleshing out the young dark elf and hardening him up for the dangerous journey ahead. A very fun book and I look forward to delving deep into the long list of Forgotten Realms books.***If you're looking for dark ambient music that's perfect for reading horror, thrillers, dark fantasy and other books like this one, then be sure to check out my YouTube Channel called Nightmarish Compositions: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPPs...
