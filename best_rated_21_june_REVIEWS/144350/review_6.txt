The Battle for Skandia is the fourth book in the Ranger's Apprentice series.What can I say? These books are just incredibly relaxing for me to read. Flawed but endearing characters, easy but exciting plots. I don't have to think and can just enjoy it.Though in this particularly there were some things I would have liked differently. Most importantly I would have liked the book to deal with Will's trauma a bit more. He was enslaved, abused and drugged in the last book... I feel like he should have some form of PTSD. Instead it was just kind of dropped and hardly ever mentioned again. That was a bit disappointing. I also feel like the series could use a bit more direction at this point. Not that it's not interesting but currently I'm missing an ultimate goal. What am I reading to? Is this series going to follow Will's life for the rest of eternity until his death? Just like some kind of road trip? Not that I won't read this, but still... A bit direction would be appreciated.Apart from that, I'm still enjoying the series.
