(3.5) To be honest the first half of this book was pretty painful and I struggled to push through.The long descriptions made my eyes wandered but the flashbacks made me hopeful.The second half was much better and the twists definitely kept me on my toes. Overall I enjoyed most of the characters and the story. I did think some characters were... very lucky and the ending was so-so. Can be read as a standalone but I will most likely read the second book.
