DNF. I dunno maybe I'll try again at a later date. This is strange because it wasn't because I didn't like this book but more that I didn't have any drive to finish it. I had no connection with any of the characters and I found myself not caring about the story either.5 Years later...Past Regan was so wrong this book was SO GOOD
