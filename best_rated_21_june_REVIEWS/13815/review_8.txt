4.5 Stars.Mara is a fantastic heroine and probably one of my favourite female fantasy protagonists. The second book in the series has none of the lull so many sequels suffer from and instead packs plot for at least two books into one.What I enjoyed most, for once (and it did come as a surprise) was the romantic element. I really loved Kevin as a character and found his relationship with Mara to be one of the best aspects of this book.Every characters gets to grow and is developed further. The world building continues to be rich and intricate, and I can't wait to read the conclusion. There is no reason not to like this one if you enjoyed Daughter of the Empire.
