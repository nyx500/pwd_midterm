I'm continuing to enjoy the hell out of this arc of the Riftwar Cycle fantasy epic. The relationship between Mara and Kevin was becoming a bit too perfect / nicey-nicey for my taste and so I was happy when it was brought to an end, and in a way that made sense. I didn't care for the parts about Mara's son since he just seemed like a spoiled brat to me, but fortunately that wasn't the focus of most of the book. The battles were well written, kinetic, and bloody. The political maneuvering was intense. A good number of named characters died, which I do appreciate in a fantasy epic. Looking forward to the next one.
