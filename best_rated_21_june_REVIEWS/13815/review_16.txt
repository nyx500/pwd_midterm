I really enjoyed this one and thought it was better than the first book. I see in other people's reviews that they didn't like Kevin, but he was probably my favorite part of the book. My gripes from book 1 do continue on in book 2 though - Mara plans always go perfectly for her and it all seems very coincidental. The right people side her way, the exact right things happen in the exact right order - which is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Reading this series does make me want to go back and finish the Riftwar series, which I had started but didn't really love.
