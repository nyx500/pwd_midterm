7yo Emily would be so happy right now!Finally got around to reading this book and I'm so pleased it was so close to the movie I adored as a kid. The best scenes are definitely there and they still made me laugh.As an adult though, I have to say Miss Honey treating Matilda as an equal was... weird to say the least.
