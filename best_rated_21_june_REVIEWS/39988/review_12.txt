The most important point to remember before and while reading this book -:: Do not try any of the acts mentioned in this book at home or in the school or at work ::Roald Dahl's Matilda is about the exceptionally talented and smart little girl Matilda, who is, unfortunately, never properly understood or encouraged by her parents. She is amazingly self-motivated and finds ways to quench her thirst for knowledge and wisdom.A light hearted, fun, entertaining and magical read for all!
