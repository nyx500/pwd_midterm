[For God's sake leave Roald Dahl alone! Sometimes, especially in FICTION, people are fat or bald or ugly, and if you, the adult, cannot handle it--believe me, your child will not be the one who's offended--please feel free to read something else. Rant over.]Dear Matilda, how I'd love to skim your Goodreads profile. Your 'read' list would put mine to shame and I would be absolutely, one hundred percent okay with that. I do have to tell you aren't the first person who comes to mind when I hear the name Matilda, which leads me to wonder if you've ever read Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell? You must have, surely. Your parents would be pleased to hear they made a fabulous television adaptation of Cranford, though I doubt they're the kind of people who can appreciate the talents of Judi Dench as Miss Matty Jenkyns. By the way, what did you make of Brighton Rock at the age of four? I, myself, just happen to adore it.
