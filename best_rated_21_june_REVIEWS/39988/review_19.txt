This book was MAGNIFICENT. I would have adored it as a kid, and even as an adult, I thought that the language was so enchanting, the storyline was heartwarming and gripping, and Matilda herself was such a strong and dynamic role model. I will definitely be investing in more Roald Dahl books, because I thought this one was beautiful and the pictures went with it so well and all the descriptions were so nice and it was such an enjoyable reading experience.However, I docked a star from this because I felt as if there was some antagonization of athletic and overweight women. Anyone who wasn’t described as skinny or beautiful was described as a villain, like Trunchbull and her athletic body type constantly being something to be seen as gross and inhumane, and as other bullies who are described as being fat are seen as sloppy and unlikable. Additionally, I felt Trunchbull herself turned into a horrible character. I realize that a lot of the situations in this book are hyperbolized, but literally throwing kids around with no penalties even though another adult was present felt very abusive and although Matilda and Lavender worked to play pranks on her to get her back, it read as really severe and actually made me uncomfortable and pitiful for the children at certain points. But for a kid’s book i’ll take it with a grain of salt and just say that I really really wish I would have read this as a kid and it’s making me want to read all the classic children’s literature.
