Turns out that the movie was way different than the book. But that's okay, because I'm a Howl simp first, human second it was soo good! Very tempted to go watch it again.~~~~~~~~~~~~~ASKJDLAKSJDAKLJDSL IT'S HEEEEERRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~~~~~~~~~~~~~Update: I put this and other Studio Ghibli movies on hold at my local library.Now it's time to wait.~~~~~~~~~~~~~This book was so charming and wonderful, therefore I don't think I will ever be able to properly review it.(That sentence took me 5 minutes to type. I am shooketh.)I loved everything about this book, from the way that the simplistic writing made me feel immersed in the magic to the characters (but especially the characters. Can I marry Howl? Although, I feel like that will interfere with my ship because you knOW I SHIP IT LIKE CRAZY WITH HOWL ALWAYS BEING ADORABLY MELODRAMATIC AND SOPHIE BEING SO MATURE AND RESPONSIBLE AAAAHHH SOPHIE X HOWL OTP OTP OTP OT-)*ahem*(sorry you had to read that)But seriously. These two are couple goals:aaagaghg stop too cute too cute too cuteI really loved the characters' dynamic and the way that they were like a family (I'm sorry I'm soft for that trope I can't help it), and also the way that appearances were portrayed in this book overall.And while I've never watched the Studio Ghibli version (I promise that I'm remedying that VERY SOON), I feel like I'm obsessed probably from the fanart intake, and experienced a bit of nostalgia while reading this. It was probably just the longing to live in this world, though.I. JUST. LOVED. EVERYTHING.~~~~~~~~~~~~~AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH I'M IN LOVERTC BECAUSE I HAVE FANART TO SCROLL THROUGH
