This was awesome. It's delightful, thoughtful, and funny. The language is fantastic, with tons of witty turns of phrase. I liked Sophie's down-to-business attitude and perspective a lot. There are fun crossovers with our world and endlessly refreshing magical mischief. And all the moving pieces come together in one sweeping ending, which, just wow.I'm also not sure that this book could get published today. It's clearly middle grade but the character ages are all over the place. The main character, who is probably in her late-teens, spends most of the book as an old woman.Now I want to see the movie. My edition has a funny interview with the author at the end that was a nice way to end the book. Dianna Wynne Jones seems like she was amazing. I'll be reading more of her books soon!
