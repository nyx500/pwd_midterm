I loved it, obviously, but of course there isn't a book written by Rick Riordan that I don end up loving so there's that. I like mythology in general, but there is something about Ancient Egypt that makes my nerdy heart go boom boom boom chica boom so I feel like The Kane Chronicles was written epecially for me. Ha! I wish! I loved all the characters be them good or evil. Yes, I admit that I find Set really funny :)). Besides Carter and Sadie I also adored Zia, Ra, Bast and Bes and omg be still my fangirl heart I fell in love with Anubis, I know, I know. Kinda reminds me of Nico di Angelo. Speaking of the Anubis business, the whole Walt thing didn't sit so well with me at first, just because in the second book Sadies' attraction for Walt felt too sudden for me so I didn't felt their attraction at all. But I understand the need for Walt as a character and I accepted him just because Anubis and Sadie couldn't happen without him. Oh? I got your attention with this non? Well I guess you have to read it in order to see what happens. Of course this whole Anubis/Sadie/Walt thingie is just a small part of what this series is about so don't freak ok? I just wanted to talk about it because that was the only thing that I could get snippy about, the rest was just epic as usual. Yep! I recommend it !!!
