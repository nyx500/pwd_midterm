4.5 stars!!So I couldn't wait for my physical copy and just finished reading the ebook and I also ended up highlighting a lots of lines in the book. I was so excited for this to come out and Uncle Rick didn't let me down!"I should also tell her I didn't hate her. In fact, I liked her pretty well. All right, I loved her. She was the bratty little sister I'd never have had."The amazing relationship between Apollo and Meg made me crave for an older brother that I'll never have. The book also portrayed Apollo's love for his twin, Artemis( or Diana for this book). Apollo may not be good in romantic love but he loved his sisters greatly! The gradual transformation of Apollo is carried out beautifully throughout the series. This was definitely not the same Apollo as seen in The Hidden Oracle. Uncle Rick also managed to show Apollo as a 16 year old Lester as well as a 4 thousands year old god at the same time, which is one of the many things I loved about this book."Each person's grief has its own life span; it needs to follow its own path"I was excited to go back to Camp Jupiter. I also loved the addition of a new character. And there was a battle! Reading the battles of Riordanverse is so much fun!I'd admit that this book was more emotional than last and had lesser quest. But the fun and adventure, nonetheless, was same.I loved every moment in the book and when I turned the last page my heart screamed for more! I can't believe this wonderful series is going to end soon. I'm so much more exited for The Tower of Nero! I'd like to point out a mistake in the book( atleast it was there in my e-book). In chapter 41( If you hate me, fine Just don't hit me in the gut Or, well, anywhere) Reyna says to Apollo on the bridge "...Then , on Calypso's island, I was supposed to be an obedient servant..." I think it's supposed to be Circe's island not Calypso's.
