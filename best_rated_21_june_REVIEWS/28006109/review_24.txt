"How do you tell a dream from a nightmare? If it involves a book burning, it's probably a nightmare."3.5I think this was my least favourite book in the series. I still liked it but not as much as the other three, and especially not as much as The Dark Prophecy which was my favourite in the series. I'm not sure yet if I'll just order the hardcover for The Tower of Nero or I'll wait for the paperback to come out so it will match with the other books. That's something to be determined in the near future. The plot was kinda slow for my linking. Most of Rick Riordan's books are really fast paced, but I felt like this was just taking its sweet time and because of that, I just got a little bored halfway through the book. I liked seeing, Hazel, Frank and Reyna again and that did make up for the slow pace, but it still wasn't enough to erase the boredom I was feeling. I liked how Apollo is affected by everything taht's happening around him and most importantly because of him in this book. We can see how his character is developing and leaving behind his bratty god attitude. And I personally love how Meg is helping him with that. She makes this book so much better, especially when Apollo starts his self-pity sessions. By Rick Riordan standards, I though it was an okay book, but it could have been so much better. I just didn't find this book as good as the rest of his works and I'll forever be salty about that.
