I'm always fascinated with war games. And in reading this one, the hunger was satisfied.I'm in a reading hiatus. For the past two months, all I read is comics and reread some short stories. This is the point that I reach my reading plateau, or should I say I am asking myself the question why I am reading? When I read the Burning Maze last April 2018, I am dissatisfied with what I read in the book. I felt it is just moving a phase then return back to where it began. The only thing new on that particular book is the death of Jason Grace, but it just added to my sorrow because of an event that happen to our family... Fast forward, Tyrants Tomb was a gift, but after thanking the giver, I just put it in the bookshelf. Until last week, in an unknown instance, it fell to the ground. I pick it up and open the book... Then I read, Tower of Nero, Fall of 2020. Then I open the front cover, and it happened... I just read and finished the book... Fast-paced, action packed, excitement are some of the things that describes this book. Thus, more prophecy, old and new characters and quite good Roman war. Mostly, the book teaches us that change is the only constant in this world. And life is not just a piece of driftwood that easily burn but a light that sometimes flicker but continues to burn.Thank you for this one, it offers something that led me to continue reading. ðŸ˜Š
