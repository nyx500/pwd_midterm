#1 The Bridge Kingdom — 4.25 Stars#2 The Traitor Queen — 3.75 StarsReading this book was taxing.It was like jumping hurdles after hurdles. Intense, plot driven, and action packed. I felt like I could barely catch my breath. I’m not exactly complaining because I like this kind of books, but pheww . . . give your girl a break. And I’m not just talking about me, but the heroine Queen Lara also.She was trying hard and doing her best to make up for her mistakes while being treated rather unfairly by Aren and his people. I mean, I get it you’re hurt and angry and you feel betrayed, but let’s get over it and work things out together. It was frustrating at times, especially because Aren was behaving rather unkingly. Being fickle and indecisive.Despite that, I’m honestly impressed with Lara. I feel like she was such a strong and unrelenting heroine. She endured A LOT in this book. And I absolutely loved the reunion she had with all her sisters and them doing a mission together to free Aren from their father’s clutches.There were a lot of epicness in this book. However, at the same time, I feel like plotwise it was pretty anticlimactic and the romance was just downright disappointing. We were slightly backward in development from the previous book. Aren and Lara were mostly miserable and during the times when they were not, I wanted MORE.That said, I’m on the fence about book 3.
