I've neever thought I'd ever say this but probably there was a bit too much angst and self-loathing in this one. LOL! Considering that I'm usually the first sucker for such stuff and yet it still was a bit overmuch. While I get why this bit was written like that, it's still way too heavy on self-loathing. Sharks to the plot rescue! Nice twist with the sharks. I loved it even though it felt like a bit of a cop-out. Overall, a very dynamic fantasy. Great take on the fem angle.
