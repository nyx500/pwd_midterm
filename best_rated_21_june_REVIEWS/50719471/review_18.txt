Just because a choice is hard doesn’t mean you don’t make it.The Traitor Queen is the second book in this series and the last for this protagonist, The next book will feature different protagonist. This is not only a good book but an awesome conclusion to the story.This book picked up a few months from where book 1 ended with Aren a prisoner of the Maridrinian king and Lara a prisoner of Ithanica. She was later released to help rescue Aren. This book is action packed, the fight scenes were well depicted, I adore the characters. The presence of her sisters in this made it all the more better. I love the world building, it's barely above average but it was easy to understand. The book is written in dual narratives of Aren and Lara.Lara was as great as ever, I loved her in this, she was remorseful for what she did but didn't let that dictate her life, she did all she could to make amends.Aren was still cool, I loved him here also. The first half of the book was hard for him which is normal because he all but lost everything because he trusted the wrong person. But as the book progressed he moved on for the better.I love this book, I highly recommend it.
