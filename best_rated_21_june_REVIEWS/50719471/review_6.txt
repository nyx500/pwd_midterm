It physically pains me to have to write this review. PHYSICALS. PAINS. ME.The first book is complete and utter perfection. Zero flaws. Couldnâ€™t put it down. Am prepared to be buried with it in my villainess tomb.This one was......medium, at best.The biggest problem, for me, was that the first one had the perfect combination of action, character development, slow burn romance, lovable characters, hilarious witty banter, and total badassery. Yet, this one only had action. That was it. You barely see the characters you loved from the first one. The healing of the slow burn romance isnâ€™t really there. There IS a lot of regret and self-loathing, but thatâ€™s to be expected. Itâ€™s just sort of steady throughout. Thereâ€™s no ebb and flow of it, if that makes sense. Itâ€™s a straight line. It doesnâ€™t move deeper or into more shallow waters. Itâ€™s just....flat. There were maybe a couple of instances of very, VERY short banter. And a lot of instances of Aren simply looking off into space and magically knowing and understanding exactly what his enemy was thinking/plotting. Sigh.I get itâ€”the countries are at war. We knew that going in. But, it became exhausting to read because that was legit all the characters did. Everything else we loved about the first one took a backseat.So, I suppose if youâ€™re someone who reads strictly for plot, then youâ€™ll love this book and will think Iâ€™m bananas (which is fair ðŸ˜‚). If youâ€™re someone who reads for plot AND characters, romance, banter, and development.....then I need you to lower your expectations significantly before you begin this one. Like, lower than dirt level expectations. Maybe crater. Ocean floor. I also probably shouldâ€™ve given this 2 stars, but I canâ€™t bring myself to do it. I blame 2020.
