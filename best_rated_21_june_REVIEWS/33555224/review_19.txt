If I use the term  shook  like I usually do to describe what I’m feeling right now, it would seriously be an understatement for this book. I loved every. single. page. and I am so glad that it loved up to my expectations of being just as great as Scythe which was one of my favourite reads of 2017 ❤️I used to think that I wasn't really into dystopia anymore but I reckon it's Neal Shusterman's mind blowing writing style that has made me fall in love with this world! Also can we please come up with a petition to save Rowan Damisch from anymore harm?? I MEAN READ THIS: “His eyes had a careworn coolness to them as if he had seen more than he should, and had stopped caring in order to save what was left of his soul.”  ??? HOW MUCH MORE PAIN WILL HE GO THROUGH!!! PLEASE that boy deserves to be happy, my heart hurts for him so badly 😭😭😭 Citra has become a queen like yaaas gurl you show 'em how things are done 👏🏻The character development in these two since the start of Scythe has been so damn good I'm in awe!! I also loved reading about the Thunderhead - an AI that cares so deeply for humans and grieves for them??  "... I seed the clouds somewhere in the world, and bring a lamentation of rain. Because rain is the closest thing I have to tears.”  You got me hooked real good. I found that as I was making my way through the chapters, I was so lost in the world that I genuinly didn't want the book to end. The ending came too soon and now the wait for the next book is going to torture me but I am already looking forward to rereading Scythe!  NOW THAT ENDING.  It tore me apart. My emotional spectrum experienced everything from grief, numbness and shock to relief, curiosity and excitement. I was warned about the ending having an effect on me but  boiiiiii  I did not anticipate how deeply it would affect me lmao I am still reeling y'all. I just know that this story will stay with me for a very long time and I would definitely recommend everyone to pick Scythe up since it's  one of the best decisions  I have ever made 😌Buddy read with  my faveee ❤️
