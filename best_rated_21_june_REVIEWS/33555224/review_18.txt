Hell yes this was awesome!Also that ending?!? So glad I’ve got the next book already so I can just get started 😊4.5 ⭐️ “Guard your conscience, Anastasia, and never let it wilt. It is a scythe’s most valuable possession.”  This was a fantastic sequel to Scythe, I loved it!So Citra (Scythe Anastasia) and Rowan (Scythe Lucifer) are living more or less entering separate lives. Citra is being trained by the infamous Scythe Marie Curie and Rowan is on the run. Soon Rowan discovers a terribly dark secret within the Scythdom but is powerless to stop it. And when Anastasia and Marie’s lives are put at risk the entire Scythdom becomes a danger zone. I love the sections of writing in between chapters that are told from the Thunderhead’s POV, the world Shusterman has built is honestly incredible. There’s not a great deal I can say because of spoilers, but this book was absolutely addictive and I cannot wait to pick up The Toll.
