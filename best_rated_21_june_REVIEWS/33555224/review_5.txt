5+ Stars – EXCELLENT!Update 12/5/2018 - Should have won the 2018 Goodreads Choice Awards YA Sci-Fi/Fantasy Category! In my heart, it is the winner!First of all – that cover . . . beautiful! It is one of my favorite covers of the past few years. An improvement on the cover of the first book – and that cover was pretty awesome, too. This cover makes you want to read this book even if you have no idea what the book is about. In this case you can judge a book by its cover!A fantastic continuation of the story from book one; I would have to say it is even better than the first. The author has done a great job of carrying the story over, keeping it fresh, keeping it creative, and not losing any momentum. With that in mind, I can easily say this is one of the best sequels I have ever read. (i.e. Empire Strikes Back is to Star Wars: A New Hope as Thunderhead is to Scythe). I am trying to come up with other positive adjectives so I can describe this story. The suspense and action are perfect. So many questions answered and so many new ones to leave you hanging. Great pacing with no filler. The chapter breaks with thoughts from the Thunderhead are very HAL from 2001; insightful, thought provoking, and totally creepy. The climax and the ending – just WOW! Outstanding stuff all around.If you read the first book, definitely read this one. If you haven’t read any of this series yet, why are you wasting your time reading my reviews and clicking around on Goodreads!?!? Get outta here! Go check this out ASAP!
