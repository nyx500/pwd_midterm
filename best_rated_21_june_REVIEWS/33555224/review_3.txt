EVERYONE GO AND READ THIS BOOKI can't believe what I just read THAT CLIFFHANGER This is quickly becoming my favorite series  EVER I actually thought I will not enjoy this book as much as the first one because the first half was a little boring but the second half was the best thing that I have ever read and that's why this piece of writing deserves a million starts.I can't remember the last time I was so invested in a story in this way. I have so many emotions over this book and these characters that I don't know how to express them.I'm not ready to read the next one because who knows what expects me there.
