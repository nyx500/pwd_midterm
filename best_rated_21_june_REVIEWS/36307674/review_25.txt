3/5 ★★★☆☆“Maybe the gift of being human is that we do not give up—even when all hope is lost.”So... this was kinda disappointing. At first, I was delighted with the book despite all its political plot, but then a lot of things started happening that ruined it a bit for me.This will not be a review but rather a list of all my complaints (with spoilers) and the things I loved, so don't read on if you haven't read the book.WARNING: This is just my opinion. I’m not looking to fight anyone. If you are here to comment hateful things, I will delete the comments and not reply.Things I didn’t like:1.	David’s death. Does anyone want to explain to me what the point of this was? It’s clear that the author wanted to repeat the same formula of Crooked Kingdom to move us, only that here it wasn’t justified at all. His death changed absolutely nothing or had a purpose, so it was unnecessary. Has Genya not suffered enough? Why did everyone get their happily ever after except her?2.	The Darkling's participation. Another completely unnecessary thing, which is a shame because I was excited to see what role this character was going to play in this book. He was just there, not really causing a stir and trying to create more drama. And the ending? It was something out of the sleeve. After doing absolutely nothing important in a six-hundred-page book, the author decides to present him as some kind of hero and locks him up in a tree...REALLY!? And as if that wasn't enough, now they feel bad for someone who literally murdered thousands of people and they want to free him 😬3.	Leigh destroyed Nina as a character. Yes, she did. Nina had always been characterized by her loyalty, her love for her country and its people. And now what? Are you trying to tell me that she's happy pretending to be someone she's not for the rest of her life? Do you mean to tell me that it seems perfect to her to leave her whole life and not return to Ravka? Seriously? Her relationship with Hanne didn’t seem credible to me at any time. It was very forced, and I felt like Leigh wanted to introduce another LGBT character just to please her fans. We never really met Hanne after all.4.	Nikolai's demon. I love Nikolai and I laughed a lot with him in this book. He is definitely one of the best characters of the Grishaverse. However, he has been struggling with his demon since the Grisha trilogy... How is it possible that after so many books Leigh hasn’t given a solution to this problem? Yes, he already controls the demon and used it in the war, which was great. But is he going to stay like that forever? So many books to give us this as his ending? I’m not satisfied.5.	The ending felt too rushed. Everything was solved in like ten pages.6.	  PLEASE LEIGH, DON'T WRITE SIX OF CROWS 3! DON'T RUIN THEM!━━━━━•❃°•°•°•°❃•━━━━━“Are they going to march us to our death now?” asked Jesper.“No idea,” said Kaz.Jesper cursed. “I wish I’d worn a nicer suit.”The three stars were because, despite all, the book entertained me and made me smile several times. I loved the appearance of my dear Crows, I died with all the scenes between Zoya and Nikolai, and I really enjoyed all the drama with the Shu (it was very interesting). Besides, Zoya's development was extraordinary and Nikolai was everything. Zoya as a Dragon Queen? Yes!Zoya and Nikolai as a couple? YES! (It was fan service, I know. BUT I LOVED IT!)Kaz protecting Inej? PLEASEEEEE!Wylan and Jesper living together? I already died, bury me.“I would give you a crown if I could,” he said. “I would show you the world from the prow of a ship. I would choose you, Zoya. As my general, as my friend, as my bride. I would give you a sapphire the size of an acorn.” He reached into his pocket. “And all I would ask in return is that you wear this damnable ribbon in your hair on our wedding day.”P.S. This cover gives me years of life 😍 It's perfect!
