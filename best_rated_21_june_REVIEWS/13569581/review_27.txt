A superb coming of age story, one which I don't know why I have postponed to read for so long. Good thing I finally got to it!It's an epic fantasy, slow burner, and a real page turner for me. Vaelin al Sorna reminded me a bit of Fitz, therefore I couldn't but love his story. Everything I want in a fantasy work is here: a character driven story, thoroughly detailed worldbuilding, plenty of action but without gory or gruesome parts, a bit of magic which I think I'll get to learn more of in the next volumes, plenty of mysteries and twists. And of course, animals; hope they'll have a bigger part in the next volumes.Writing is smooth and fluent, in a way very similar with Al Sorna's character. The story is told mostly in flashbacks from his point of view, with short interludes between the main parts from a chronicle who is writing his story, and who doesn't get to know the whole picture like we do. Hard to believe this was a debut, it's that great. On to next volume right away.
