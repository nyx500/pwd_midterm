Finally! A book that lives up to the hype. Blood Song is the best debut epic fantasy I've read since The Name of the Wind was published in 2007. It had everything one could want in a book. Action, mystery, romance, intrigue, and plenty of surprises. The world building was good, the plot complex, and the various characters were full of depth and personality. This was a thoroughly exciting and enjoyable read. Anthony Ryan might just be making a case to join my quartet of all time fantasy favorites. High praise considering that list is Martin, Rothfuss, Lynch, and Sanderson.Rating:5 stars!Audio Note: Steven Brand was an adequate narrator. Competent but nothing special. Re-read 1/7/15 - Almost as good the second time around!
