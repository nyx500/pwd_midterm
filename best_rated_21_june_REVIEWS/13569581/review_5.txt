I'm going to put this on hold at 25%. Maybe I'll come back to it at a time when I can understand the 4.51 average rating. You know - a tiny 1% of those who read this book rated it 2 stars or less. Only 7% rated it 3 stars or less. As you're probably realizing, that means 93% either "really liked it" or thought "it was amazing". I can only conclude that my brain has been hijacked by something that doesn't appreciate amazing things.But let me at least try to explain myself. I'm not a big fan of romance. WAIT - WHAT?! That's not relevant! No, please, I have a point, I swear! I mentioned this in one of my youtube videos, but I don't like most romance books because they're so predictable. I mean, you know what's going to happen, don't you? You're in the romance section! That's a spoiler in itself. Psst, they're going to get together!Well, Blood Song is about a guy called Vaelin Al Sorna. And Al Sorna can't do anything wrong. He excels at everything he does and comes out on top in every situation. He's smart, strong, resilient, brave, self-sacrificing, a hit with the ladies and he never fails. This guy sweats faultlessness from the age of 12.So, like, I feel I already know what's going to happen with this guy. He's too perfect, too dull, to really make me concerned about what will happen to him. It's true, it's early days. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Al Sorna will face some realistic challenges and actually experience - *gasp* - failure.But, for now, I'm a little tired of reading about the sunshine beaming out of Al Sorna's amazing ass.
