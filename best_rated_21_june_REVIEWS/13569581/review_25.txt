I had heard a lot of good things about this series but I felt that I went into it thinking it was going to be a three star at best I believe because it has been compared to Name of the Wind, a book that I enjoyed that was subsequently ruined by its sequel The Wise Man's Fear.Blood Song is told in a similar manner. The story is told from the perspective of the main character Vaelin Al Sorna after the events have occurred. He is telling his story to a scribe who has heard the stories of the Hopekiller as he is known, but they are exaggerated. The events start with Vaelin's placement in the Sixth Order by his father, where he learns to become a warrior for the Faith.Name of the Wind is also told from the point of view of the main character to other characters, and begins with his schooling life. But I feel like that is where the similarities end thankfully.Rather than being great at everything (like Kvothe) Vaelin admits his weaknesses, and his faults. He feels a lot of guilt about his actions in the heat of battle. This often comes off as whiny, but in this case I felt it was fairly well done. He was likable enough as a character, although there wasn't a whole lot unique about him.However, the world building and the story itself more than made up for the character flaws. The author is new to the fantasy genre, and I'm excited to see where he can go.
