First re-read finished. Rating stays the same. Buddy re-read/read with a bunch of lovely friends at Sanctum of Fantasy group before book #3 comes out in the beginning of July. Want to join? :) We're starting on Monday, June 15th. Original Review, 31 August, 2014I'm surprised this is a debut novel. Believe the hype! Oh yes, the book has its flaws but I can't quite put my finger on them and they are certainly not enough to even make me knock off a half star down to 4.5 for the rating. It's full 5! What makes the book unputdownable is the scale and the intensity of the story. More Vaelin Al Sorna, please! Up to book #2. Full review to come eventually.
