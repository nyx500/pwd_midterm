This took me literally no time at all because this story is SO. GOOD. This world is the most unique thing Iâ€™ve read in a very long time, and the whole thing was filled with so many twists and turns and surprises I was left on the edge of my seat the ENTIRE. TIME. I need the next one NOW. NOOOWWWWW.
