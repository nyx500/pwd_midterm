You know those times in life when you feel this deep chasm in your soul and all the emotions get sucked into it? That's what this book did for me. This whole series was beautiful. From the first book it was a crescendo of ideas that were so exhilarating at some points of the book my excitement came out of me in waves. So you can only imagine what happened to me when this series ended so amazingly. There are truly no word to describe how much love I felt for the characters, and the exhilarating consequences of their lives. Normally politics in books and stories bores me, but not in this case, everything about the way the events were played out made them interesting. I'm normally never satisfied with the way series end. There's always that pang of regret after mulling over a story for so long, but after a really long while, this series surprised me. After being so good, I was waiting for the moment I would be disappointed, and then it didn't happen and I was like......."omgggggggg". Yup pretty much how I feel, a holy mess of emotions.
