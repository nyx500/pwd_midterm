THIS SERIES WAS PERFECT. Im crying. That last chapter ended me. Im so so happy I decided to read all of these books. I love this world, I love the characters, I love the story. Cinda Williams Chima is one of my new favorite authors and I honestly cannot wait to read the spin off series!! Im ordering the first one right now. Im seriously in awe, this was such a good ending. I loved every minute of it. 100% recommend if you are looking for a classic well rounded YA fantasy series.
