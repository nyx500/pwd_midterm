Update: The more I think about it, the more I realize I didn't enjoy anything about this book at all so it's more suited to be a 1 star.---This book was 600+ pages of slog to get through. I understand how people would consider the sequel to be an improvement since the main character shows more agency and certain tropes are reversed, but the development was very on-the-nose and came at the expense of turning other characters into cartoonish villains. The writing suffered a lot from telling and not showing, especially when it came to the dialogue, where it mostly consisted of the main character asking questions which would result in the other faeries answering via several pages of monologues in order to tell the exposition and characters’ background stories. This would be fine if I cared about anything in the book at all, but I don’t. People hyped this book up to be some trashy erotica, but there were only 2 sex scenes towards the end; otherwise, the book is just a very boring fantasy story.
