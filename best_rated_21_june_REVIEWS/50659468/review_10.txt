Fair notice: Lot of fangirling/feelings ahead.This was basically me during the whole book:And now I finished and I’m moping around, thinking over and over:  PERFECT. BEAUTIFUL, HEARTBREAKING AND SO MUCH MORE. This book makes me feel so many different things at once that I have to just stop and think until I can get my head straight.Because ACOMAF has it all –  Beautiful writing, twisty plot turns, SNARKY BANTER that made me laugh out loud, PURE FAE AWESOMENESS specially from the NIGHT COURT CREW, heart-pounding suspense, CRAZY ACTION SCENES, WOMEN’s EMPOWEREMENT, and a SEXY ROMANCE that me made blush and swoon SO HARD. Because the story is not only about love, but also self-discovery. It’s about Feyre finding who she is and what she wants. We feel how broken she is, relentlessly blaming herself for the deaths of those ferries she killed and hunted by the horror she witnessed Under the Mountain.  "The power did not belong to the High Lords. Not any longer. Ot belonged to me - as I belinged only to me, as my furure was mine to decide, to forge"  Her character development is simply PHENOMENAL, because through her new adventures, she grew able to accept and embrace all that pain.  She became stronger and more determined than ever, while she is still the same stubborn and brave character we love. And the least I can say is: GO. FEYRE. CURSEBREAKER. DEFENDER OF THE RAINBOW AND HIGH LADY OF THE NIGHT COURT. GO.Because Rhys - did I mention how much I love his character? - broke my heart more than once as we got to know who truly he is. SJM made me feel his love, his losses, his pains and overall his passion for his people and Court."I stared at up at him, breathless, while he smiled. The smile the world would likely never see, the smile he's given up for the sake of his people, his lands. He said softly, "I am... very glad I met you, Feyre""He remains Rhysand the mysterious dark high Lord, sexy as hell, playful and shameless flirt but we discover the sensitive Rhysand who feels too much and who is constantly doubting himself when it comes to his family and court."Rhys still knelt, wings drooping qcross the white sheets, heqd bowed, hos tattoos stark against is golden skin. A dark, fallen prince"Because I want desperately to be part of the NIGHT COURT and ITS MAGIC. The world-building was unique and SJM draws an interesting world of political relationships, uneasy alliances, and different races.Because the last few chapters left me jaw-dropping and the cliff-hanger at the end leaves us with so much potential for the next and final book. THANK YOU SJM FOR THIS BOOK.Can I say one last thing? NEW SHIPS ARE SAILING, guys. YES TO NASSIAN AND MORIEL.Verdict: SEXY, ROMANTIC, and INTENSE. I  DARE . YOU TO STOP READING.
