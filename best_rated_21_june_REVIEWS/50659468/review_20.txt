This is exactly how you develop a healthy relationship. This is why my bro Rhys is such an likeable character. He respected every wish and need Feyre had, every choice she made, gave her the space and the time she needed to heal, but at the same time he pushed her to grow and thrive. Feyre was always an equal to him. We have no choice but to stan.
