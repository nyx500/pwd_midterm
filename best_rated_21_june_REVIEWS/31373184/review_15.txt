‘you are made of dreams and this world is not for you.’reading this book made me feel like i was dreaming someone elses dream, a dream that only makes sense to the dreamer and i was the intruder. thats really the only way i can describe my experience. from the first page, the first word, i could tell this story is means something to someone. stiefvater has always had a dreamlike quality to her writing, but this story made me feel like i was inside her sleeping mind and i just couldnt quite grasp what it all meant to her. i was never the biggest fan of the raven boys series, but i appreciate ronan for being such a complex character. however, the only moments where i really looked forward to reading about him was when he was with adam. i know many people will fall so in love with this story, but i sadly have to admit that this book is made of dreams and its world is not for me. ↠ 3 stars
