Ronan Lynch is everything! “I think it means I’m a raven. That makes you a raven boy.” -The Dream Thieves. "Squash one . . squash two . . squash three!!" AAYYYYYYYYYYY!!^^( LMAO! GET IT? )^^I am honestly not even surprised to hear about this. Extremely happy? Hell yeah! Surprised? Not really.It's no secret Ronan has always been Maggie's favorite, and when she first started writing TRB it was meant to be about Ronan and his dreams. I think it's time to find out what The Raven Cycle was originally supposed to be about.(AWW i could stare at this gif forever. This is exactly how i picture my Adam.)THAT SMILE! *HEART EYES* "Thanks for the straight teeth then."^^(Look at them straight ass teeth! Tell me this isn't a perfect Adam Parrish!!)Don't get me wrong, i adore Gansey!! But everything Ronan Lynch does is just 50 times more interesting than looking for the dead king, or waiting for some "true love's kiss" to happen. My only question is whether it's prequel to TRC series or does it come after?I know, i know, everyone is super excited about more "PYNCH" (myself included) but i could kill for a prequel. There are so many questions: The Raven King gave me no answers! Plus, i'd rather read Ronan and Adam's earlier interactions. AHHHH let's not forget Kavinsky and Ronan trying to kill each other *MY HEART*. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT RONAN WAS LIKE BEFORE HIS FATHER'S DEATH, DAMN IT!! To all you Ronan haters out there:This kid gets so much hate! Him and Adam, both. And i do not get it. Some people feel this urge to tell me how much they dislike them and why, as soon as they find out how crazy i am about this series (are we still calling it the raven cycle?), and how Gansey is the main character blah blah blah. Guess what? I DON'T GIVE A SINGLE FUCK. You are not coming in my house and insulting my children. Not acceptable. Get out. Bye, bye!
