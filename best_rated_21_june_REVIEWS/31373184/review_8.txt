Cool. Fun to exist in this perpetual state of agony. Iâ€™m fine.Update 9/26/19:Just popping back in a few weeks before publication to say that I think this is so worth the wait. This is ambitious, original, and darkly fascinating. It offers so much character development and is occasionally just batshit crazy with its worldbuilding and fantastical elements. Once you start reading it is impossible to look away. I can't wait to talk about this book nonstop with all of you soon.
