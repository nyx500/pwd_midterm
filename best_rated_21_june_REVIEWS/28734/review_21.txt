Skimming through some other reviews I passed one that called this book "Cheesy, tawdry, melodramatic". I completely agree, but I actually reveled in those facts while the other reviewer gave it two stars. :P It's definitely over the top and has some logic defying moments, but I find myself quite invested in Valdemar. I *was* a little torn on my rating and I think 4 stars is rounding up for me because there was a resurgence of the plot point that bothered me in the Vows & Honor books I've read so far, which, prepare for triggers people, is sexual assault in the form of a gang rape. I *will* say I thought the character reacted much more realistically and was actually shown to be dealing with emotional wounds after as compared to Vows & Honor where people seemed strangely unaffected (yes, people, plural, ugh), but...was that really necessary in my nice cheesy fantastical romp with telepathic horse-like creatures? It would not have taken anything away from the story or character development to leave it out and would in fact have improved the experience of reading quite a bit. Soooo be careful of Mercedes Lackey if you are triggered by such things, she seems to be sprinkling them into her world pretty liberally thus far.
