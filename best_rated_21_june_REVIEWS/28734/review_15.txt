This is the ending of this trilogy and though there is some real joy in this book there are also some incredibly sad moments. Vanyel has spent the last few years pulling away from those closest to him in an attempt to prevent them from becoming targets. And at the same time his responsibilities as the most powerful of the Herald mages have continued to increase, requiring him not only to protect the realm but also to take on diplomatic duties with the increasing illness of his king. But Steph, a young bard is interested in him and unwilling to except a casual friendship as the only relationship they’ll have. It’s the relationship between these two men, it’s consequences and the ways in which being a herald challenges their happiness that are the primary concerns of this book. And that, though I felt like the last third of the book was more than a bit rushed, provide us with a pretty good story. We even get the chance to spend a little bit of time with Vanyel‘s family and see how Age and the increasing difficulties faced by Valdemar have changed his parents.And the ending was bittersweet, I don’t know that this Trilogy could have ended in any other way. It was a little sad but also sort of lovely.
