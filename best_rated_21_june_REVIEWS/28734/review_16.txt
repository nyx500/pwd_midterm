No, that certainly wasn't the ending I was hoping for, but never mind. What really baffles me is the way Mercedes Lackey delivered Vanyel's last stand. Damn, we all knew from the very beginning Vanyel had to face Laereth and was unlikely to make it. Hell, the series is called "The Last Herald Mage of Valdemar" so nothing that happens in the book should come as a huge surprise to the reader. BUT OH MY GOD, did we really need those last 100 pages? And the pacing, don't even get me started. When the final confrontation arrived AND PASSED, I was like "Oh, that's it?!". A lifetime of build-up for Vanyel and, what, 5 pages for the reader? And we certainly didn't need the YOU KNOW WHAT scene. It was super uncomfortable. And I'll say it here: Stefen is useless, a poor replacement for 'Lendel, a character I couldn't care less about that in the end gains my sympathy just by virtue of having his life completely trainwrecked by the author. Just, honey, you are the last of a really commendable series of young man screwed by Mercedes Lackey so forgive me if I don't care. And where is Medren? Where is Tashir? Did we really need another SJW speech to Vanyel's parents? Not because I don't agree with the content, of course, but for its redundancy. It could have happened off-screen! Welp.
