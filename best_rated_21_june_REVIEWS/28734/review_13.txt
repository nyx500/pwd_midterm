I was debating giving this book a three, because I did enjoy parts, but in the end I decided it just wasn't good enough. You can read other reviews to see what's wrong with it, but, in a nutshell: most of the issues in the story aren't well-resolved, such as the king's illness and the idea of Stefen as a reincarnation of Tylendel, and most importantly, who the hell Leareth is; there is a severe inconsistency in the difference between the deaths of the two herald-mages and Savil's death which is not explained; there is a seeming introduction (be aware that it's been a while since Promise) of *two* new species, which I found underdeveloped and inappropriate for the final book in a trilogy; I was very unhappy with the way Withen was very civil to Vanyel from the beginning but apparently not enough, since we still had to hear the whole sob story from the Tayledras; and finally, there really is no excuse for Vanyel, a war-hardened Mage and supposedly shrewd political player, not to have taken Savil's concerns seriously after Lissandra's and Kilchas's deaths. It went beyond stupid to being out-of-character and implausible.The characters were nice, maybe memorable (we'll see) but certainly people you could get invested in. But let's be honest, there are a lot of authors who come up with good characters. The book has some great ideas, too; I liked the idea of the companions and the way magic was handled. But in all honesty there is nothing that would make me recommend this book. I might recommend it if you wanted something that combined gay fiction with fantasy, but if you're only looking for one or the other, don't bother. I can recommend much better options.
