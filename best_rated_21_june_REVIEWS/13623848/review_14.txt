Real fans already know: I'm heartless. I'm soulless. My resting temperature is 35 degrees Fahrenheit and I have a deep abyss where my cardiac system is supposed to be.So it shouldn't be surprising to anyone who is familiar with me that this book didn't make me feel much of anything.I didn't read the Percy Jackson books in elementary school (I was too busy sneaking into the teen section at the library and reading books that would cause me to ask my mom what a blowjob is at 9 years old). I don't read much historical fiction now. Mythology generally is like a worse version of fairytales in my mind.Anyway this was a recipe for disaster, is what I'm saying, and instead it was just. Kind of boring? To me.So really that's a compliment, I guess.Bottom line: Not my cup of tea!-----------pre-reviewme and madeline miller just don't get along.review to come / 3 stars-----------currently-reading updatesthat day has arrived.-----------tbr reviewsaving this for a day i want to cry during
