I hereby award ALL THE STARS in the universe to The Song of Achilles, a story equal parts epic and heartbreaking.Furthermore, this is absolute audiobook gold!!!I knew nothing about this going in, besides the fact that it is based off the events in Homer's epic, The Illiad. Despite the fact that I took 4-years of Latin in high school, I couldn't tell you the first thing about The Illiad.I was completely floored by the absolute beauty of this story, which centers around the love between Achilles and Patroclus. Admittedly, I am not an avid romance reader. Oftentimes, the romance will be my least favorite aspect of a given story, but for some reason, this one struck me straight in the feels. There was something so pure and confident in their love. They were loyal, brave and kind to one another in a way that had me reaching for the tissues instead of choking down my mirth. I just knew from my level of attachment that this one wasn't going to end well for me. I was fully anticipating to end up as a puddle on the floor. I was overwhelmed by the intensity of feeling this story was able to elicit from my cold, dark heart. The Ice Queen hath officially melteth.If you are considering reading this yourself, for whatever reason, I cannot recommend the audiobook enough. This narrator absolutely nailed the feeling of the story. His voices for all characters was just so expressive and was always recognizable for who he was portraying at the time. In particular, his voice when speaking as Achilles, straight up Chris Hemsworth. Honestly, not a bad picture to have in mind whilst listening to a book.To sum it all up: READ THIS BOOK! The world would indeed be a better place if this book were required reading. I honestly believe that.
