wow. i wouldnt have originally considered myself whole-heartedly invested in this series, but then the epilogue happened and quite nearly destroyed me. my goodness, my emotional reaction to that was completely unexpected and now im tempted to bump this up to 5 stars because of it. looking back across my reading experience of this series, its easy to say that there are things that i really quite enjoyed and other things not so much. but i cant deny that my attention was consistently held throughout each book. this is leagues better than the first three TMI books, but i will admit that it was such a neat feeling every time i read something that connected this series to those books. and even though i found myself not really caring about what happened with the magister and his robots, or thinking that these books could be shorter, i really did enjoy the world of the shadowhunters in london and the characters. the characters (mainly will and jem - their bond and friendship is one of the more pure things i have ever read) are really what lured me into this story. that being said, i have some major thoughts on the will/jem/tessa situation, as im sure everyone does. im not a fan of love triangles and i appreciate CC trying to make this a special circumstance, but there are some things that really disappointed me. im not satisfied with how jems story played out. i feel like he was rather cheated in the end and, therefore, will and tessa were unfairly cheated as well. i dunno. i think i would have preferred it to play out another way, but then the epilogue happened and now i dont know what to think. i guess i have to pick up TMI #4-6 to figure out how everything happened. but still. i still wish tessa went off and did her own thing, as im not her biggest fan, and then will and jem could have lived happily ever after. so thats how im rewriting the ending and im sticking with it. lol. â†  4.5 stars
