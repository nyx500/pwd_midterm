“Life is a book and there are a thousand pages I have not yet read.”Yeah, but I'd give a lot to unread this. It started off alright, but then it only went down down down:-This series made me hate every love triangle with passion-Jem was a weak and annoying softie-Will was just another name for Jace-The finale was a joke. I expect more from the ending of an extraordinary trilogy like this-It was entirely and utterly unrealistic.  I'm sorry but do you really expect me to believe that someone in a love triangle can actually have BOTH lovers in the end!? Oh and let's not forget that the "Once a Silent Brother always a Silent Brother"-rule obviously doesn't apply to Jem. It's the same thing as in the Mortal Instruments, only worse. Everyone desperately needs a happy ending. That's just not how it works. Bah. I wanted to rip those last 100 pages out. Honestly, this novel would have been perfectly fine without them but no, Cassandra Clare wanted to ruin it.I really, really do not understand the incredibly high Goodreads rating for this ridiculous book.Find more of my books on Instagram
