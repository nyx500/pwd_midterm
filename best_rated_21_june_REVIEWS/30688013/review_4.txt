Assassin's Fate (The Fitz and the Fool, #3 Realm of the Elderlings,#16) by Robin HobbNow my journey to the Realm of Elderlings has ended. And this series turned out to be one of my favorite fantasy series. It's a heartwrenching story, and I can't even say how great this series was. After finishing this book, I found myself so depressed and was difficult to concentrate on any other works. I love all sixteen books in the Realm of the Elderlings series. Don't skip over any of the other series before you read this one. Because Hobb connected her previous series with this series beautifully.This is our last hunt, old wolf. And as we have always done, we go to it together.Goodbye Fitz.P.S: Chronological order of the Realm of the Elderlings series:Farseer trilogy1. Assassin's Apprentice2. Royal Assassin3.
