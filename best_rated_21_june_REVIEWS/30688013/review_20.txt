Well, here we are. I will definitely be letting my thoughts digest a little bit before writing more, but for now, I will say this:This book was the absolute perfect conclusion for this trilogy and series overall. Thank you, Robin Hobb, for sharing your story with the world. It will certainly go down as one of my favorite, if not my favorite, fantasy series of all time and while itâ€™s tough saying goodbye for now, I am looking forward to revisiting this world over and over again in the future.
