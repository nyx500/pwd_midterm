Having followed the story from the beginning, Assassin's Apprentice, to here I was so nervous, waiting for this to come out. Turning the last page of the previous book my heart hit a wall. How could it end there..... well, it didn't. I produce the UK cover art for Robin's books, and I knew this would be the third in the trilogy, and the cover art would have to be the best I'd done. Robin fed me a short piece of the book when I asked her about the cover and oh it was worse than reading none, because then, of course, I wanted more. And then she sent me the manuscript. When you read to produce the cover art you read in a different way, searching the text for a key, an image. The trouble is that Robin writes so well that I get picked up by the story and carried along, forgetting it's work ( please don't hate me). And this book is everything I ever wanted and more. Things I couldn't imagine. It's like being in a boat in a storm at sea at times. You can't breath, you can't read fast enough. Sketch after sketch I did and it was knocked back by the editor as being a plot spoiler, so I can't show them, and then Robin talked me through the towers. The bee is an obvious motive. I can't say more.I only read the unedited text. I know the book has been edited and honed and polished since then, so it is with great excitement that I await a proof copy of the book. When I get it I will lock all the door, pretend I have gone away on holiday, admit no one, speak to no one, do no work, until I've read the book, this time for the pure pleasure of the story. Because that's what it is. A masterpiece that spins a tale woven around the difference between justice and vengeance.
