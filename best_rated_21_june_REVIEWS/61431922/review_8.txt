Fourth wing(noun) my favourite hello and my hardest goodbye… *intense sobbing*…TO ANYONE LISTENING YOU NEED TO GO INTO THIS BOOK AS BLIND AS POSSIBLE I PROMISE ITS GONNA ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE TENFOLD. ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THIS WILL BE YOUR NEW FAV BOOK FOREVER <3But for everyone else who needs to know…Here’s a quick rundown of the book: it’s about the daughter of a high-ranked general, Violet, getting ordered into learning how to become a dragon rider (but she doesn’t initially want to bc all she’s known are books her entire life) and so she commits to basgiath War collage where she goes through trials designed to root out the weak. She has to figure out how to best everyone and weaponise her strengths. While navigating her feelings for a certain forbidden boi. There’s romance AND (back arching) spice with sparks and tension galore. Also for everyone wondering, the ending isn’t that bad. It’s more of a promising cliffhanger. Makes you feel hopeful rather than making you want to crash and burn everything in your line of sight lmao. *I’m sorry in advance bc this review is gonna be gigantisaourus *wags brows* do you see what I did there?It’s been ages since I’ve loved all the MCs in a book so I deserve to go crazy on the fangirling, leave me alone 🙏This book. THIS BOOK- It gives you EVERYTHING you crave in romantasy. The drama, the characters, the plot, the action, the betrayal, the romance, the tension, THE HOPE THAT THERE ARE STILL AMAZING BOOKS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD- AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER- There is not a single dry page. Not one. It constantly stimulates your imagination. And there aren’t the usual boring unnecessary bs conversations happening, they’re almost always full of banter and in every chapter, something is happening. It’s fast-paced and that’s something I ADORE about this book. BUT CAN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FUCKING TENSION PLS?? The addictive chemistry between XadenVi will chew you up, eat you alive and then shit you out, effectively altering the composition of your DNA forevermore 😩❤️‍🩹The dialogue in this book is so yummy istg I was always giggling and kicking my feet whenever the MCs would interact 🤭💗🦋 they’re both sarcastic funny smart and complement each other sm. I’m telling you this book never left me wanting for anything. There was never a time when I was like ugh the MCs hardly interact or wtv. There’s a perfect amount of every aspect in this book, I’ll never be able to get over it. While reading, it leaves you feeling as though you’ve lost a limb whenever you have to remove yourself from the book to carry out the most trivial inconvenience like feeding and hydrating yourself 😤🔪 I'm telling you this book is the only sustenance I need to keep me alive 🙏Violet is me. I am Violet. We are one. No bc she is the most relatable character I’ve read in a long ass time. The way she is so reasonable, empathetic and HAS INTEGRITY. She’s not a pushover. She knows her mind and isn’t afraid to speak it when she feels the need to. There’s no ‘my body is betraying me’ bullshit. Not in this house. I’m in LOVE with violet sfmmm. She owns her feelings and demands what she’s owed. And when Xaden challenges her but she takes it as an incentive to poke and tease him back tenfold is ✨💗🦋🤌 Watching her grow and become stronger was one of the most satisfying things about this book. Her character development was elite. She never changed her morals but she always adapts and moves on quickly and I cannot stress enough hm I love that about her.  There wasn’t a single moment where I was annoyed at her for being hardheaded. She’s strategic but also carefree. She behaved like a normal 20-year-old would, not older/younger. XADEN is such a seductive menace but he’s MY precious seductive menace. He's always up for a challenge and he SERVES every freaking time. I love everything he has to say. He’s such a lil softy when it comes down to it. Him showing his love through his actions and constantly challenging Vi to do better?? It’s the way he never coddles her but also shaves years off his life, worrying about her safety for me 🥹💗🙏😩🦋💞✨🧸I’m always waiting on hands and feet for any interaction with him whether it be his glares 🤭their not so short glances across the classroom 💞his sarcastic quips 💅him being a brooding surly grump😩him being lethally calm 👑him obsessed with her every move 🙏💗Him telling her not to look at him like that bc he only has sm restraint?? 🤌❤️‍🔥 (I have to note that Lance did it better sksksksk) BUT EVERYTHING HE DOES IS HOT PLS-  The way I fell for him the first moment he was described?? Everyone is saying how he’s like this guy or that guy from this book and that and I’m just here like idc if he was an amalgamation of every MMC I love?? I DONT CARE BECAUSE IT MADE ME LOVE HIM EVEN MORE 👏 I respect Rebecca for plucking the best traits of every fantasy MMC, like don’t be shy put some more 💀✋And there are the dragons but all you need to know is that each one has their personality. They rule themselves. They're the real legends here. And the way this author has weaved them into the book is just MWAH *chefs kiss* The found family in this book is the most precious thing ever. I loved to read how they’re bonded together and I can see that each relationship has the potential to grow into something really special ugh I cannot wait for the next books 😩 Okay SPOILERS ahead!! bc your girl gotta scream <33---When Tairn came out of wherever tf he was hiding I was screaming and legit shaking from the adrenaline. I’m still having a hard time accepting how good this book is! I thought she would only get Andarna and I was kinda disappointed bc the moment Tairn got mentioned in that lesson I JUMPED ON THE IDEA OF HIM SO FAST YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. But when he came to save her and Goldie AND THEN SPOKE TO HER IN HER MIND?? I BROKE DOWN AND HOWLED. SO. FUCKING. LOUD. And then Andarna was like “TELL HER MY NAME AS WELL” and I’m- *passes out from yelling so much* I LOVE ANDARNA SFMMM SHES THE MOST ADORABLE CUTE LITTLE SUNSHINE IVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO READ ABOUT 🥹🫂💗😫💞🧸 The light of my life I’m telling you. she must be protected at all costs. (But omg at the end Xaden was like Goldie’s gone huge and I’m here like oop- I NEED TO SEE HER RFN) I love how Tairn is a dad adjacent to Violet 🙏 he’s my grumpiest overprotective pookie 🤭💗with STRONG feelings for his mate skskdhjd (I’m kinda jelly of Sgaeyl ngl) ALSO HOW FUCKING DARE YOU REBECCA!! You ripped my heart out of my chest, gave it a thousand paper cuts and flung it into a volcano for good measure. Liam's death BROKE me🔪 I cried too many fat ugly tears 😭 it was unbearable *shaky breath* but when XADEN found out and cried the cry of all cries?!? Me: (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`) X 100And the fact that her brother is alive made me do a lap around my garden from sheer satisfaction bc I WAS FUCKING RIGHT. 15% in I guessed that he would be alive but he’ll be part of the “wrong” side of the war and it’s been kept a secret bc of the shame/treason and AHHH *does cheerleader flip and cartwheel*And Dain?? That pussy ass lil BITCHHHH- I wasn’t born with enough middle fingers to let you know hm I feel about him. He’s basically Adam from shatter me, and fml bc my reread is just gonna be me wanting to rip his spine out and strangling him w it whenever he speaks 😃🔫But when that inntinnsic called his every thought out to the crowd it was the most hilarious shit ever pls 💀 he’s so pathetic. SPOILERS OVEROne thing I have to say is that this book is not perfect. The action aspect of the book gets a LOT better towards the end imo but the start was a little rusty and needed some finesse but idc idc I’ll take it, faults and all. After all, I’m a character development lover so I can overlook it. BUT THE WORLD BUILDING IS- ヽ(♡‿♡)ノOml the way this author writes leaves you ON THE EDGE WHITE KNUCKLING YOUR SEAT GASPING SHAKING SCREAMING bc you have no idea what will happen next.  IT'S THE BIGGEST FLEX TO NOT ONLY OUTDO THE OGS BUT TO EXCEL PHENOMENALLYYYYY AT IT AS WELL 💅✨ REBECCA YAROS YOU ARE AN ICON BC I GOBBLED UP EVERY SCENE EVERY CHAPTER EVERY WORD.

His chest is massive, with wide shoulders and heavily muscled arms alongside. A target this big should be easy to hit. “Nope. Not when you brought enough for the both of us.” A wicked smile curves his mouth as he stretches out his hand and curls his fingers in a come-hither motion. “Let’s go.” ~the scream I scrumpt“Going for blood today, are we, Violence?” he whispers.“I just need to know what my chances are here.”  My hands curl into fists.
