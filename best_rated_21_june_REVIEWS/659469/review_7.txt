This was given to me by a friend for Christmas back in 92 it is wonderful ill version of The Hobbit very well adapted from Tolkien's book which I have read 10 times over last 40+ys .It can be hard to do justice to such a good book but this surprised me with its great art work it is Shame that the Sillmarlion or The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers or The Return of the King in separate volume have not been done As love see how the Ents came out.
