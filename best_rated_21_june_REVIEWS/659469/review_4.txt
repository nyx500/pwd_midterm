2.5* - okay, the art in this is beautiful and very detailed, itself deserves 5 stars for sure.But this just couldn't do the original story justice. I get that you can't put all of the original text in a graphic novel, but everything felt soooo rushed and I don't think I would get it all if I haven't read the Hobbit.
