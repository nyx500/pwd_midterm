The 4/5 star rating is based on my feeling that "the Hobbit" as a story is a five. However, I wasn't super crazy about this particular representation/presentation of the timeless Tolkein masterpiece. Hence the knock down to 4. I'm sure most of us hardcore Hobbit/LOTR fans will appreciate this format, to some degree, but NOTHING beats the original imho.
