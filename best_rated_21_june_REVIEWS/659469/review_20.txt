I read this comics adaptation a bunch as a reluctant teen reader. As a comic, it is very text-heavy, with almost a paragraph of narration (carefully abridged from the original book) for each panel. It would have been nice to have twice as many pages to make it more readable and to improve the flow, but the reader is lucky to have even this many pages! Each page is masterfully crafted by David Wenzel. His ink and watercolor illustration perfectly brings to life the fantastical subject matter!
