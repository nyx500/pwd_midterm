This is a classic that I read recently (as a novel) and I fell in love with it, instantly!When I saw the graphic novel I knew I HAD TO READ IT TOO!!!It was amazing!Beautiful artwork, with lines from the original book itself.I think it is great for any kid who hates reading but loves comics and graphic novels. THIS will get them into reading actual books, trust me!I think that this is the second book (first is Harry Potter, obviously...) that I'm going to flip through whenever I feel bad, just to comfort myself, relax and smile...
