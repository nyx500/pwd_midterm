Want to catch the flu? Read The Stand.I caught it twice in the month it took me to read this book. Twice! I'm rarely sick so it's clearly a thing.Post-apocalyptic book where most people die from a super flu. That part was my favorite.It then becomes a battle between Good and Evil. Some fantasy elements were included. This part was still solid. I liked how we got to follow the characters and get to know them. I felt some similarities to Station Eleven so if you like The Stand I would give this one a shot too!
