3.5 starsI liked so many aspects of Raybearer: a determined main character who grows throughout the novel, a well-balanced group of friends and a romance that does not take up too much space, and themes related to loyalty, destiny, and gender inequity. I appreciated how Jordan Ifueko included asexual representation and some interesting commentary about state repression of people’s dissent. The ending surprised me in a pleasant way with its more thrilling execution, which made me curious about the sequel to this book.The reason I do not rate this book higher is because I felt that a lot of the book’s events came across as predictable. The majority of the conflict in the novel did not come across as high stakes to me because I could assume early on how they’d be resolved. While Ifueko ended Raybearer on a high note, I wanted more of that tenseness and surprise throughout the book, even if this first book served to set the stage for future installments.Overall, would recommend to fans of young-adult fantasy who find the book’s synopsis interesting.
