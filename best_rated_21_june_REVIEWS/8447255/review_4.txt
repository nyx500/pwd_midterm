Re-readI started a new job right about the time I finished Dust of Dreams which was 13 months ago. With time constraints personally and professionally, not to mention Covid, I just didn't have the energy required for Malazan for a long time. I'm glad I finished up the re-read but something was definitely lost in waiting so long between books. People who were reading these before all the books were published must have struggled mightily with this. --------------First readAlmost a year later and the 20th book total and 10th of the main series I’m done. What an epic ride that simply never disappointed. Not that I didn’t have doubts early in the series a few times. But this series really has it all and I mean that literally. Elf’s, Dragons, Trolls, Ogres, shaper shifters, gods, magic of many forms and a system to back it up, religion, politics, humanity, violence, battles, war, love, history, ancient civilizations, action across better than five continents, divination, mysticism……I could go on and on. And yet all that doesn’t begin to tell the story of why it’s great. The compassion weaved into the world and characters is beyond comparison. Simply the greatest series I’ve ever read. As for this book it’s really hard to say much without giving things away. I will say everything gets wrapped up. At the end there were tears in my eyes. So many characters had such crucial roles. Some always there unsuspecting.
