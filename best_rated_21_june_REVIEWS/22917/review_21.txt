People say that magic isn't real. But is this what one thought while listening to bedtime stories and fairy tales during childhood? Those tales always left me astounded and in awe, like people after a magic trick. The Complete Grimms' Fairy Tales is a German collection of fairy tales by the Grimm brothers or "Brothers Grimm", Jacob and Wilhelm. It contains numerous stories some very popular and some not so much. Some famous tales include Hansel and Gretel, Cinderella/Ashputtel, Sleeping Beauty/Briar Rose, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Snow White and many more. The Disney movies also played a major role in popularising them among the modern audiences. But these stories are very different from the Disney ones, these are much darker, with murder and mutilation in almost every other story.Reading some stories took me down the memory lane, but it was also amazing discovering some new stories that I liked and enjoyed. However not all of the tales are enjoyable; some are very boring, without any story construct and downright skippable.
