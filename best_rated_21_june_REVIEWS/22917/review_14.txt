For this collection, to appreciate each story I definitely recommend reading it over a longer duration of time. Take your time and space out reading between stories. Maybe even read only one story a day because the stories can become quite repetitive and dry. Specifically related to this edition, I wish that there were more illustrations and that they were placed more appropriately. There were a few illustrations but really only a handful considering the amount of short stories in this collection. As for the illustration placement, I think it would have been more appropriate for the illustrations to be placed at the beginning/end of each short story or within the accompanying short story instead of placed randomly throughout. If you like classic literature, you may like some of these short stories. It's interesting to see how these fairytales have been adapted and changed since their origin. ***Thank you to the publisher for supplying me with an ARC of this edition of classics via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review***
