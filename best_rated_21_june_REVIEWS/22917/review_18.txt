I love fairy tales. I grew up with Disney's cute, timeless renditions of them. I think it's important to point out, though, that Disney definitely made the majority of these stories much more palatable. For example, in the original Sleeping Beauty, the prince basically rapes the princess while she's asleep and by the time she wakes up it turns out she's already had kids by him. In the original The Little Mermaid, the mermaid kills herself after seeing the prince marry a human girl. In the original Cinderella, the stepsisters cut off parts of their feet so they can fit in the glass slipper. It kind of worries me that these types of stories were considered children's stories in the days of yore.
