Here We Go Again.First, I want to make clear to everyone that I Looooove TMI and TID, Loved them. But there's already The Dark Artifices coming and now this? The thing about lots of books in a series is that, for them to work well, the author has to built this whole excellent world that is just so well written and so thought of that you can't help but want continue to be in it - for example Harry Potter. The Nephilim world is amazing and I've loved learning more and more about it and I can't seem to get enough of CC's books but.... no more.Let's think about TMI and TID for a minute.... they are different periods of time and yada yada... but what are the similar things??? ....Oh Hell, I'll just say it: Characters. Now please don't hate me for this, but Will is Jace, Jem is Simon, Jessamine is/was Isabel just as Tessa was Clary. Of course there were differences, like how Clary was more... feisty? not sure if that's the word I want to use, but whatever. While Tessa has a more quiet strength in her. Still, they are very similar. The same theory that applies to the story applies to the characters: Jace for example, was an Amazing character to read, he was refreshing, funny, charming, EVERYTHING. Which is why it did not bother me at all to see the same qualities in Will, but... but.... no more. CC is an amazing writer, but I would just love to see something new from her. She seems to have so much potential and I really think she has the talent to create a whole other new world, with more new and refreshing characters, I would just really like to see her explore that side. That being said... maybe I'll read her new Nephilim books. I did not continue reading the second part of TMI, but I did love the whole TID series... I just think that too much of something can really be a turnoff. Personal opinions people, I just felt like ranting.
