I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that a disappointing book is as bad as heartbreak. I haven’t fully comprehended nor accepted my heartbreak yet. I think. I feel like I’ve gone through all the stages of grief here. As I was reading this book, I was in denial that this book was actually boring me. I was hopeful that it would get better. That everything I loved about Nevernight would appear. That my reluctance to pick up this book would dissipate. I kept on bargaining with myself about it. But my gut-fucking-instinct knew that this story wasn’t improving. The new relationship that flourished between Mia and that thing irritated me beyond belief. The hypocrisy of Mia when it came to not holding that thing accountable was aggravating. And then they fell in love? Based on what exactly? Then came the stages of anger and depression and bargaining. My heartbreak was clouding my judgement. I wanted to blame myself that I wasn’t liking this book. I wanted to say that it was my fault that I waited this long to read this book. Would this have been different had I read this when it came out? On and on came the questions and self-doubt. But then the anger took over again and I knew I wasn't to blame here. It’s the book. The story and I didn’t click. Mainly due to the fact that the story wasn’t right. I might have been partially to blame for some things, but most of the blame lies with the story. And we now come to the final stage of grief, as they say. Acceptance. Acceptance and acknowledgment that this story was a flop. And acceptance that I’m not bothering to read Darkdawn. And now my heart is being flooded with relief. ——————————So like I accidentally read the last WORD of GODSGRAVE as I was checking the page count AND I AM FREAKING THE FUCK OUT RIGHT NOW!
