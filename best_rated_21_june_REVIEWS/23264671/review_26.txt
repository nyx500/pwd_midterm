3.5 stars!This book is a tough one to rate. I was super hyped for it but I spent about 300 pages of it really bored and confused because it was super dense. I just don't think I have a grasp as to what the fuck was happening the entire time which definitely frustrated me.I went in with the expectation that I would either super love it or really hate it and I'm kinda in the middle. I'm not sure how to feel about it. I. Need. Tric.
