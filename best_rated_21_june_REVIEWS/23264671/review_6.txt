5 Stars (And I'm being stingy with these this year, so this is a big deal, gentle friends.)I originally marked this as 4+ stars.But after further consideration of the following:1) I read this book in ONE sitting because I was so spellbound. And, 2) I re-read my review for book one and realized that ALL the things I said I couldn't stand about book one, I adored about book two...I decided to say, fuck it, 5 stars for everyone, folks. And because good on you, Sir Kristoff. He really is a creative talent. Now, if you read my review for book one (which you can find HERE), you will see that - while I enjoyed the overall story itself - I had problems with Kristoff's almost satirical, dark humor style and his employment of footnotes as a narration tool. For those who don't feel like checking out that review (and who could blame you) or haven't read the books, here's a picture I jacked from it for reference of said footnotes:Now, perhaps it was the fact that I went into this book prepared for those things...or perhaps more aptly, I just went in to this one understanding Kristoff's style and thus - now unclouded by confusion and its subsequent resistance - I was able to just absorb the story and its characters. Either way, I just enjoyed the shit out of this book.It's original and edgy and weird and bloody and violent and I loved it. And - after that ending - I can't fucking WAIT for book three. And now - after once considering tossing both books without even cracking book two open - I find myself fighting not to re-purchase book one in hardcover. I have it in paperback and it doesn't match my book two hardcover (and future book three hardcover). Because, well...Yes, yes, I know. #ShamelessBookHoarderIssuesWe can't all be perfect. And thank fuck.
