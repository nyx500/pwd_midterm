600 pages of being blown away by this breathtaking installment in a phenomenal series. This was everything I hoped it to be and more. Fonda Lee is such an incredible story writer. The plot building and story line were so intelligent and enthralling. It’s no lighthearted read though, it’ll play with your heart and might leave you in shambles.This was definitely more political than book 1. Power struggle continues between two rival clans over control of magical jade. But this time, there’re threats from external countries and war is brewing beyond borders. It all boils down to survival. Violent feuds and combat are abundant, but we also see the various characters and their relationships mature amazingly in this book. I loved how this was totally unpredictable too.Readers who enjoyed Jade City can be sure to be thoroughly entertained by this sequel. I would recommend this series over others anytime.
