!!!!!!!!!!!!!! woahokay this book 100% makes up for the duology. the first book really didn’t impress me at all (mainly because the romance was so quick and felt forced, they were enemies for barely two chapters—) anyway. the burn, the wait, the longing, all worth it in this book. i loved this so much.
