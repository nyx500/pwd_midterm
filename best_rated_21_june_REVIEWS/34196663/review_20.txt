"'Who will write our story, Jase?''We will, Kazi. You and I will write our own story.'And side by side, every day, that is what we do.” ---👏🏼 Jase 👏🏼 Ballenger 👏🏼 - I repeat 👏🏼 Jase 👏🏼 Ballenger 👏🏼Honestly, this was such a nice ending to this duology. Even though I'm sad, because I just wish I could hold onto the Ballengers and Torfeste a little longer. I love the Ballengers, they are freaking cool 😎. Not to mention Kazi and Jase, who are THE couple, ladies and gentlemen. I liked the tension between them and the enemies to lovers trope in Dance of Thieves a 🤏 bit more, but I can't complain about the She's my wife trope we got in this book xD. I'm not even going to talk about Montegue and all the other little assholes. I mean haha they don't deserve this review and don't count in the end of the day anyways. (imagine an evil *hehe* from me here) I will miss this world A LOT, but fortunately I can revisit it whenever I want, which makes this goodbye a bit easier <3
