This series really impressed me and blew away all my original expectations! Seriously, sooo much better than The Remnant Chronicles!✅ A LOT MORE POLITICAL intrigue and scheming happened in this book. It definitely kept me interested to keep reading and see how these characters would get out of all the impossible situations they were thrown in to❌ MY ONLY COMPLAINT was that Kazi and Jase were separated for way too long 😭 So frustrating! Considering this series is only a duology, I would have definitely liked more time for them to be together in this book✅ THE PACING WAS GREAT and definitely kept you interested, although I think I liked the plot and storyline of book one better. There were so many twists and I literally screamed and almost threw my kindle at one point because I was so mad at what happened… but don’t worry, there’s definitely a HEA 😅✅ I LOVED ALL THE CHARACTERS and how everyone came together into this big found family towards the end. It took a while for everyone to finally warm up to each other, but once they did it definitely paid offOverall, I really loved this series! I do think it is on the mature side of YA but I definitely would not consider it NA or Adult. I definitely would not have minded some spice in the romance lol 😘 If you love fantasy, fast-paced books, great characters and a cute romance then you should definitely read this book!
