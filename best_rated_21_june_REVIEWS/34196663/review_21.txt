Vow of Thieves⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Hmm, it was a solid sequel. The writing style felt like breathing, it was so natural I forgot I was reading. But, and there is a “but” here, the build up was way too long for my preference. The main characters were separated for nearly the whole book, but the constant action made it bearable. I’d like to reread these books again in the future, if I’m up to it.
