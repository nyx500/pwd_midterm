i want to live inside this book!!!i'm a sucker for warm, sweet, adorably-illustrated graphic novels, and the tea dragon society is the pinnacle of the genre. the story is charming, and the art is unbelievably cute!!it's a short book, and divided into four chapters according to season. it feels nice and earthy.our main character, greta, has loving blacksmith parents (who are both semi-androgynous, which is cool). greta is learning to smith, and she stumbles onto the practice of raising tea dragons. sweet and colorful lil creatures who grow herbs, tea leaves, and flowers on their heads!!!greta learns from the wise tea masters, who happen to be a warm and friendly gay couple. and she slowly befriends minette, a shy and mysterious girl who has her own tea dragon, chamomile.in these beautifully-illustrated pages we have friendship, reverence for tradition, and deep care for those in need. it's ridiculously warm and fuzzy. i want a tea dragon of my own!!
