I’m not sure how to rate this. The story needed… more. I get that it’s middle grade, but it was far too simplistic and straightforward for my liking. I learned more about the Tea Dragons in the handbook that was included at the end of the book than what was told to us in the story.I wish it was actually incorporated into the story. The art was gorgeous and rich. But the story needed more development.
