"Memories don't just live inside you, Minette. They live in all the people and objects you share your life with.” What a sweet, wholesome read!At the surface this book is stunning, beautiful, gorgeous- all of the adjectives. But within the pages, similar, if not greater, beauty can be found. In so few pages, this book presented and explored important topics in a simple and yet thorough way. This is such a perfect book for younger readers. But for me personally, I felt that it was too short and with not enough development for my taste. I know I am outside its target audience and that the length is probably a good thing for little brains, but it didn’t have complete crossover appeal. Not that every middle grade book has to, but the best ones transcend age and anyone can get something out of. That being said, for what it set out to do, it accomplished all of it and more. I would love to continue on with series, but I’m finding it pretty difficult to access considering it is not available online like the first or through my library. If you know anywhere I can find them it would be much appreciated! If you haven’t picked up this gorgeous book yet, I would recommend it! It is such a short read that it will take you no time at all and boost the goodreads goal at the same time!★★★☆☆.5 stars
