“Memories don't just live inside you, Minette. They live in all the people and objects you share your life with.”~ Rating- 3 stars ~Content / Trigger Warnings- Minor Blood Depiction, Physical Injuries, Minor Violence, Paralysis-No Mention of these in the review-The Tea Dragon Society, by Kay O'Neill was a sweet read. It doesn't really have a plot, and the characters are a bit shallow, but the illustrations were really beautiful. I don't have much to say, and there's nothing to really 'review' about this, but I enjoyed my read. It was very short and didn't take me that long to finish. I would recommend it if you are looking for something fun.
