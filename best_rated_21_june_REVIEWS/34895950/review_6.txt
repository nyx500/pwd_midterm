This was so cute and wholesome omg!!! Read it in like 15 minutes and I just wish it was 7 hours longer - I love the vibes from this one, itâ€™s so down to Earth and dreamy and cosy and whimsical and wonderful. What a beautiful little story. Illustrations were stunning too, really added more to the story!
