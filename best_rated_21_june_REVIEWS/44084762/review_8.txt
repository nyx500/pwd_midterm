i mean, given the title and knowing how the story of romeo and juliet ends, i shouldnt be so mad about how everything plays out in this… but i am.and im probably just bitter about it because i wanted a strong, happy ending to offset how meh i felt about the rest of the book. mainly because i couldnt care less about the historical revolution happening in shanghai at the time. the communists vs. the revolutionists is not a subplot i care about, especially when the book is as long and drawn out as this one is. give me more gang fights, give me more monsters, give me more betrayals. basically, just give me the first book again. lol. but i suppose i cant complain that the story sticks to the heart of the story of romeo and juliet and does so in a very unique way. i have no doubt many readers will love this conclusion to a very entertaining duology. i just wish i personally cared about it more. :/thanks simon and schuster for the ARC!↠ 3.5 stars
