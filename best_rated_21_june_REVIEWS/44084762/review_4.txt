Alexa, play The Great War by Taylor Swift.SHAKESPEARE WISHES HE WAS CHLOE GONG. HE COULD NEVER WRITE THIS MASTERPIECE.So, it took me a while to finish this book (more than a fucking year) and it was because I knew what was going to happen... And honestly I wasn't ready. As I said in my review of These Violent Delights, Romeo and Juliet was my first book, and Roma my very first crush, like ever. Holy shit, my mum had to see me cry for him like for 3 hours...Book 1 made me cry slightly, but book 2 broke me like a fucking promise. I said what I said.I knew how this was gonna end. I knew it was gonna break my heart and shatter it into million of small pieces. I knew I was gonna cry like a bitch because I'm a cancer with pisces moon, which means I cry a lot, lmao... And still, I read this book.I'm a masochist, I can see it now.Dear Chloe, please let me live like a delusional and let me have my happy ending, pretending that my Juliette and Roma lived forever happy.
