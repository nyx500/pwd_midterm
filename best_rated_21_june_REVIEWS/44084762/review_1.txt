If you thought THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS was incredible, then Book 2 is going to blow you out of the water. I'm incredibly lucky in that I am one of the first people to read an early copy of this book, and I genuinely treasure this experience beyond words. I can't wait for everyone to read this masterpiece. I am in such awe of this book and am certain all of these characters will live in my heart long beyond the completion of this story. I cried, I laughed, I screamed, I loved. And truly, what more can you ask for in a book?More than anything, this book reminded me that at the heart of it all, daring to love is bravest thing we can ever do. Chloe Gong has built a tale wondrous enough to rival Shakespeare. (He's been real quiet since THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS came out...)
