(4.5, rounded up)This book was just--wow. Probably one of the most stressful books I've ever read, but in the best way possible. When reading These Violent Delights, it took me a good chunk of the book to get into the story, but Our Violent Ends had me utterly hooked from the start. The writing made me feel as though I was in 1920s Shanghai right along side Roma and Juliette.One of the things that truly sets this book apart from other Romeo and Juliet retelling is its unique ability to reshape the borrowed characters and make them anew. While this book maintains a high stakes conflict, the characters still drive the book. The balance of plot and character development was extremely well done, and if I thought I loved the characters after reading the first book, I was proved completely wrong. Our Violent Ends had me so insanely invested in this characters I was holding my breath every time something seemed to go wrong. In a way, Our Violent Ends felt like a completely different book then These Violent Delights. The author's substantial growth as a writer became abundantly clear from the get-go. Our Violent Ends truly takes you into the heart of Shanghai, and the switch in point-of-views was utilized much more effectively, giving the reader a greater understanding of each side involved.The ending of this book just absolutely crushed me. Chloe Gong threw my heart down the garbage disposal and ran away. This book was more than just a retelling, it truly managed to create an entirely new narrative that is both as beautiful and heartbreaking as its source material.It is now time for me to sit and wait--laughing maniacally--for you all to get a chance to read this show-stopping sequel to These Violent Delights. Our Violent Ends was an amazing conclusion to new top duology of mine. It won't disappoint.Be aware that like the source material, Our Violent Ends does feature suicidal ideation and actions. As always, be kind to yourself.
