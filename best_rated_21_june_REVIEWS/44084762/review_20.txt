My full review is now up on my book blog, The Quiet Pond.I finished it. I read it in one day. I'm numb. I'm numb. This is a phenomenal sequel and it won't disappoint if you loved These Violent Delights. Stressful, satisfying, terrifying - but you will be fed.Your heart may be in pieces but you'll thank Chloe for it. Y'all should be very, very scared. Pain is coming - and you're going to love this. ðŸ˜ŒI received an early copy of this book from the author.
