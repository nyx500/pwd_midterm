Overall, this is 3.5 stars which I’ll magnanimously round up because I really liked a few of the characters and some pretty awesome scenes/moments. There were definitely parts which really piqued my interest and the magic was cool. If the black ka’kari can be called a character, it’ll definitely be one of my favourites. My wish for more arcs and significance from Dorian, Solon and Feir materialised but I was not entirely thrilled with how they were dealt with. It actually made the whole plotline a bit of a mess. So on one hand I was pleased to read more about them (especially Dorian), but on the other, it nagged at me that I didn’t enjoy it as much as I hoped to. This was also probably the first time where I felt practically indifferent to the main protagonist of a book, in this case, Kylar. I don't dislike him but he just doesn't make me feel invested in him. The parts of Kylar which I really loved were when he was fighting and when he was interacting with Durzo. I really started to like Vi as a character in Shadow’s Edge but she was seriously reduced to a wetcloth, all because of Kylar, in this book – come on woman, you are awesome, get a grip on yourself!! The way the various arcs were seemingly centred around the love of a woman was irksome and resultantly the ending was clichéd in an almost cringe-worthy manner. While the cool magic (directed by Dorian no less) did save the climax - powerful magical artifacts are awesome! - I could do with less of this whole power of love angle. Sigh... this could’ve been amazing, but with the undulating tones of great, good, mediocre and unsatisfactory, I’ll write this down as an above average read at best.
