4.0 StarsThis was such a fun assassin fantasy story.Â I have previously read and enjoyed the Lightbringer series so I was interested to read the author's debut series. While I still prefer his sophomore series, this series is a surprisingly close second.I have been previously hit or miss with assassin fantasy but this one proved that it's just a matter of finding the right series. I often struggle with action driven stories but this one had a good balance that worked well for me.My favourite aspect of the story was easily the characters. I loved their backstories, their humour and their flaws. Like in the Lightbringer, this story addresses division in gender and the challenges of being a woman in a patriarchal world. I was impressed by the depth and complexity of the themes explored within this series.I would highly recommend this series to readers looking for a underhyped fantasy series with a great balance between character development and an exciting plot.Disclaimer I received a copy of this book from the publisher in preparation for the release of the new Night Angel book which I am excited to read closer to the release date in April.
