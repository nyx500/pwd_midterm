Last book in the trilogy - three stars.It was a very epic grand huge book.But there were oh so many issues.Like the other two books in the series this was riddled with pacing problems. The first 500 pages of this book were so boring and painfully bad that I almost just tossed it in the garbage and really the only that saved it was that it was the last book in the trilogy and I wanted to see how it ended. Then the last 200 pages were filled with enough world shattering events and action that it should have taken 1000 pages to tell which meant it felt very rushed.Characters - really good characters but nobody I actually connected with. They were interesting but I felt disconnected from them and didn't care all that much about any of them.Writing - not sure where to put this so I'll lump it into the writing area but the main characters story arcs weren't that interesting to me but the secondary character story arcs were amazing.Plot - it was fineI'll be generous and round up to three stars but just barely (this was a solid 2.5 star book)I'm glad I read this series as it is an important series in the genre but it's not a series I would recommend.
