The Broken Eye is an excellent continuation of a wonderful series, fully worthing your attention.“Don’t judge a man by what he says his ideals are, judge him by what he does. Look at what the Color Prince has done. They’re wrong, Teia. They’re liars and murderers. It doesn’t mean everything we do is right. It doesn’t mean our house doesn’t need a thorough cleaning. I just don’t think we need to burn it to the ground to do it.” The characters are better developed than in the previous installment, and more importantly, the secondary POVs are interesting again. Gavin & Kip had the best chapters, but I was also looking forward to Teia's & Karris' chapters as well. I won't deluge in the magic/character/world building since I have done so in the reviews of the previous 2 installments and nothing changed, but I will mention that the tension was keep building, and unexpected circumstances kept occurring all the time. Also, in the final chapter of the book, you will encounter one of the greatest plot twists in the history of fantasy. If you were surprised when you found out Gavin's real identity in the first book, your brain will just melt after reading this one. Ps. What's with the Greek words? Promachos & Demiourgos was one thing. But Diakoptes? Aka a f*cking light switch? XDYou can find more of my reviews over at http://BookNest.eu/
