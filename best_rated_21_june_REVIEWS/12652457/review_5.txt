Honestly how am I supposed to wait a whole year for this book to come out! I just spent all of this past year waiting for Blinding Knife to come out! You know Brent weeks has to be a great author for everyone to be desperate to get his books.AFTER TWO YEARS OF WAITING I HAVE FINALLY READ IT!!!!It did take awhile for me to really get into this book but I did around page 200. However that may be because it has been a really long time since I have read the last book and may have forgotten some of the more minor plot details.All in all I loved this book and think it is probably the best Lightbringer book yet! My only disappointment is that Gavin wasn't in it as much as I wanted. Kip on the other hand was awesome throughout the whole book. I even liked Andross better. If you Like Brent Weeks you do not want to miss his latest (and possibly best) book.
