I don't think this rating will come as a surprise to anyone who was following my updates. I was massively disappointed with this book and even the strong finish couldn't drag it back to 3 stars. I am going to keep this review brief because there isn't much to say to be honest. It is a book of side stories and info about the main characters with almost zero plot forwarding until the last few chapters. All of what was read in this book could have and more importantly should have, been added to the first two books. Character building should not be a book three in a series. Not only did I find the read boring, but worse, I felt like I completely wasted my money, which is not what I would expect from an author like Weeks in the middle of a series. Given that I really didn't like book one either, I would find this series difficult to recommend.
