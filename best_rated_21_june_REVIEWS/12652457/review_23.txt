2.5 starsAnother divergent rating from a lot of my buddies on Goodreads. And I'm rounding it up simply because there were some great moments in this book, which as whole just felt like it dragged on and on and on and on.. It's been awhile since I've felt so divided on a book before. These characters are good and I really liked them back in book two, but The Broken Eye seemed to have stretched out the character development on the downward trajectory as far as I was concerned. I thought that I am supposed to care more, not less about these characters by the third book, but alas, it was not the case. Kip and Teia had some amazing moments but at the same time both were given to so many instances of self-pity and self-bashing that I wanted to scream sometimes. Karris was the saving grace in this book with Gavin being out of commission, as was the White - I just could not get enough of the White. As for Andross, he's becoming more of just a big bully in my eyes - fine, a very smart and savvy one - but still a bully. And Gavin - sigh, my hero Gavin - I was hoping for some awesomeness but alas it was not to be, almost but not. I probably didn't care about half the events in the book and I'm also not sure how I felt of the revelation at the end as well. The scene succeeding that was really heart-wrenching but was it enough to make me continue reading this series? I really am not sure at this point, especially now that I realised that Blood Mirror is merely the penultimate and not the finale.
