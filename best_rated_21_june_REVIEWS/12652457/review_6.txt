Well at this point I must admit that I think Brent Weeks should have stuck to making this a trilogy. I loved the first book and enjoyed the second even more but this one was only average. There was far too much padding and even the action scenes went on and on until they became tedious.Just a few moments ago I looked at the blurb for book 4 and discover that Gavin spends most or even all of the next book in yet another prison situation. Come on Mr Weeks - here you have one of the best book heroes ever invented and you are wasting him! I think I am the lone voice in the wilderness here though. Everyone else seems to love the book so if you are thinking of reading it please take no notice of me. I now have to decide whether I can stomach reading more about Gavin in prison:(
