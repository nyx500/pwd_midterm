Is this a little bit of filler? Yes. After the conclusion of this novel, I can't wait for the 4th and final installment to close out the story lines of these characters Week's has made me learn to love/hate/love to hate. Much of what we were left with in the Blinding Knife does not get resolved here.With that said, Brent Week's "filler" is still top-notch and a joy to read. The war with the Color Prince seems to float in the background. It is still being waged, but there are no battles or chapters focusing on the Color Prince and his army.  We get a lot of Andross Guile's machinations in the Chromeria. The storylines with Teia are a big improvement over Liv's (increase of Teia = reduction of screen time for Liv). Kip seems to be in an "awkward" stage. Gone is the little fat kid trying to survive his Black Guard training. Here, a 16 year old Kip learns to live on his own a little (being separated from Gavin) and tries to find his way in matters of love, friendship and adulthood.Gavin deals with his loss of color sight.This is a great book with our favorite characters. The dialogue and inner voices are as entertaining as ever. I just couldn't give it 5 stars since it focused on a lot but "moved" the storyline very little. With everything that needs to be resolved and answered, we seem to be looking at (and waiting for) a seriously packed final book #4.
