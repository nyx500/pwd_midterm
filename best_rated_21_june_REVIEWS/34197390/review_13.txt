I would have read this book right after finishing Trickster's Choice but I'm always afraid there'll be too much rehashing of previous events etc., which gets really annoying. Instead, there's very very little, and what there is is slipped in there naturally. I was rather surprised at the things I'd forgotten, like about Duke Mequen! That was pretty significant, I'm surprised I'd forgotten that.The Balitang family return to the capital of Rajmuat where the formidable matriarch of the family, Aunt Niritin, has things well in hand. The conspiracy amongst the Raka and the household servants, with Aly as spymaster, has some serious clout and Dove on their side. The Regents of the Rittevon boy-king, Dunevon, are suspicious, prickly, unloved and reactive; it doesn't take much from Aly to aggravate their worst points and turn the populace against them, though they certainly didn't need much help for that. Nawat, the crow-man, leaves Aly to help the rebels on other islands and to grow into himself. Gifts from Aly's home make things really interesting.The relationships and politics in this particular volume are handled very well - never boring, even the plotting is exciting. What Pierce did with Sarai and Dove I absolutely love - she's not an author to be boxed in but allows for change and fluidity, and it worked out better than the original plan. I adored the darkings, which were very original and fresh and entertaining. While I did find that Aly's personal thoughts and feelings weren't delved into enough, especially in relation to Nawat, had I been reading this at 14, say, I would have been very satisfied. Probably my imagination was more active at the time and needed less direction?There's great intelligence and craftiness in this duology, as well as enjoyable characters and unique fantasy elements. Highly recommended; just don't be distracted by a few cringe-inducing past tense verbs - "treaded" is NOT a word, the past tense of "tread" is "trod". Grrr.
