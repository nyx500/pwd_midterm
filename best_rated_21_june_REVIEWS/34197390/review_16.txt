3.5 starsI liked this, but it was quite slow. So many people died though!  The first king (I can't remember his name), then Dunevon and Elsren and a couple of others, then Ulasim and Ochobu, and Rubinyan, and Imajane committed suicide. I was a little surprised when Aly decided  to stay and be spymaster, because she's so far away from her entire family now.
