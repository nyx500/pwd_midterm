Random thing: they audio narrator pronounced Aly more like "Ali" and it threw me off ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ It could be because I listen at 2x speed but it was weird lmao. I loved this book even more than the first one! I swear this book broke my heart even more, but managed to put the pieces back together in the end. Aly is in her prime with this installation. She acts like a true spymaster and I absolutely fucking loved it. It was so great!! I loved her tricks, plotting and how she schemed to take down the regents. Dove was a gem in this too. She's like 12/13 years old but she's so much more mature than other girls or boys her age. She's definitely more mature than Sarai and  I was so happy she's the one who was put on the throne. She's definitely better suited to it than Sarai. The epilogue in this was perfect! I need an extended version of that where I see all of my favorite characters from the Tortall lands. I literally love these characters so damn much I want to cry. I'm really sad this is the last book set in this time period of Tortall with these characters because I loved seeing the cameos and the other characters all grown up.
