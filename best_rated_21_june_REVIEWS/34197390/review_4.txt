The first half of the book is considerably slower than book one and seemed much more political, but I loved the inclusion of the Darkings (FUN!) and once things finally picked up, they didn't stop until the end. I have to say the entire story arc of this duology is one of my favorites of the Tortallverse -- seriously, a realm where power is passed down through the women? HECK YES. Gimme that all day long. Dove is probably in my top 5 favorite characters to ever come out of the Tortall world; I would LOVE a book about her after the events of the Trickster books, or even a prequel describing how she and Sarai grew up. Everything about this world is so intricate and fascinating to me.
