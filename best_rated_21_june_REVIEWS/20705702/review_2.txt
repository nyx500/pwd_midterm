[Original review (Oct 2014)]Group read with the IAA bunch.Let’s get two things out of the way real quick: First, the book cover. I cannot even begin to comprehend what happened there. What publisher in their right mind would choose such a trashy-romance-looking cover for a UF book by Ilona Andrews? I just don’t get it. [ETA: it turns out the Andrews had chosen an alternate cover for this book but several retailers thought it wouldn't sell {insert major eye roll here} so they went for this one instead.] Second, the inevitable Kate Daniels comparison. I have to admit I had KD in mind when I started reading Burn for Me but quickly decided to stop comparing the books and just enjoy what I was reading. Burn for Me is a great introduction to the Hidden Legacy series but it is a much lighter read than KD. Granted, as it is the first instalment in a new series, the world building will probably expand and become more complex, which I am really looking forward to.So, back to Burn for Me. This book was so much FUN to read! I really enjoyed the premise of the book: a serum that revealed different types of magic inherent to humans about a hundred years ago, the destruction of said serum and then the use of genetics to pass the magic from one generation to another. Highly magical (and very wealthy) families are prepared to go to great lengths to keep their bloodlines intact and increase their magic. Now that’s one fantastic premise! The world building is great and I love the mix of magic with the military, heavy weaponry, armored everything… It makes for a very original world.Then we have our heroine, Nevada Baylor, who has been running the family PI business since her father died. I don’t want to go into much detail here but as the story begins the business is on shaky ground and Nevada is doing her best to keep the family afloat. Nevada is a fantastic character, she is straightforward, principled and snarky as hell. I loved her from the very beginning. She lives in a huge warehouse with her hilarious grandmother, her mother, her two teenage sisters and her two cousins. They all contribute to the business in their own way and make a great family. I really enjoyed their interactions.Now for Mad Rogan, our mass murderer hero. I mean, just how cool is that? A mass murderer/sociopath hero?! Only the Andrews I tell you! To be honest, Rogan might be ruthless but after having read the book he doesn’t seem to be much of a sociopath. He was in the army and killed lots of people during the war, does that mean he qualifies as a mass murderer? I don’t know. So. The guy is sizzling hot. Sorry, I meant sizzling hot. There are a couple of scenes there (first when he shows Nevada what it means to be a –hum– Tactile then the whole scene that leads to their first kiss and…) that had me swooning, sighing & panting. The works. I can't imagine what will happen the day these two go beyond the kissing stage^^ *rubs hands in anticipation* One thing that did bother me about Rogan: the never-ending descriptions of how hot and sexy he is. Amazing abs, great chest, broad shoulders, strong biceps, incredible eyes… I got it the first three times, no need to re-hash it over and over again. But that’s a minor quibble really.Put Nevada and Rogan together, shake well and you get great chemistry and fantastic banter. So many great lines there, I wish I could quote them all but there wouldn’t be enough space in this review so I’ll just pick three:“And let’s be honest, you weren’t exactly harmed. I even took you home.” “You dumped me on my doorstep. According to my mother, I looked half dead.” “Your mother exaggerates. A third dead at most.” I stared at him. Wow. Just wow.“Why can’t you just slice them to pieces like that chopstick?” “Because my telekinetic magic doesn’t work on living things.” [...] Oh. “So the best way to fight you is to strip naked and attack?” His eyes flashed with a wicked light. “Yes. You should try it and see what happens.” Well, I did walk right into that one.“Mr Rogan,” I frosted my voice over. “What I put into my body is my business.” Okay, that didn’t sound right.Burn for Me has it all: action, suspense, lots of magic, great characterization, world building with lots of potential and sizzling hot chemistry between the two main characters. I’m definitely planning to be read it again before its sequel comes out in 2015!
