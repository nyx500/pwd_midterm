4.5 starsHIDEOUS COVER ALERT*!I refuse to blame Andrews for this ridonkulous looking cheese-fest, but I wish that whoever is in charge of this sort of thing at Avon would get a clue.This looks like the sort of thing I've come to expect from crappy PNR, not Urban Fantasy. This cover doesn't say kick-ass story between these pages, it says Fabioish romance inside. Well, guess what?They don't have sex in this book.The folks who were hoping for a little *bow-chicka-wow-wow* (thanks to the cover) will be disappointed.And the people who don't want mindless PNR (not that there's anything wrong with that!) are going to bypass this book altogether.Even I put off reading it, and I'm a fan of Ilona Andrews...so I should know better.That's the power of a BAD cover, people!Alrighty, enough bitching.I picked up Burn For Me and gobbled it down in record time.I loved Nevada and her entire wacky family. Especially Grandma!Surprisingly, I loved Mad Rogan, too. I see some complaints about him, but I thought he was awesome. Sure, it seems like he's sort of a sociopath, but I have a feeling he's a bit more complicated than that. Or maybe not.Either way, I thought he was great!Magic (thanks to a scientific breakthrough) is now a hereditary quality that the more powerful magic users in the world view as a commodity. They marry for the power it brings their families, and those Houses rule cities and corporations. Or something like that.The world-building wasn't fully explored, but I'm hoping that we'll get a better glimpse of how everything works in the next book. There was definitely enough information to get to get started with, though.I'm feeling really lazy, and I want to go eat some soup and pie.So instead of trying to review the plot, I'll just say that if you're a fan of Ilona Andrews stuff, you're going to like this.Highly Recommended to fans of Kate Daniels, Mercy Thompson, etc..*No points were deducted for the horrible cover...
