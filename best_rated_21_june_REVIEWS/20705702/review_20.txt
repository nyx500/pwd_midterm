I devoured books 1-5 of this series over the last few weeks. Here is the honest truth: I skimmed over many of the action sequences and descriptions of weapons, battles, confrontations, etc. That stuff ain't my jam. What I did read of the action stuff was great, exciting, well researched-- but I'm here for the romance and the capable, drama-free heroines. This series delivered both.The best part: I LOVED the characters of Nevada (books 1-3) and her sister Catalina (books 4, 5). They struck that difficult to find balance of being capable and strong without arguing just for the sake of arguing, or being flippant, mean, and nasty-sassy for no reason (which I find annoying). They might've been young, a tad na√Øve, but they weren't emotional morons, and that made all the difference. Loved them both.The hero in books 1-3 grew on me over time. At first he was just *meh* and felt quite 2-dimentional, but I adored him by book 3. He developed as a character and it was lovely to see. Also, he was a good balance for Nevada. The hero in books 4, 5--however--was intriguing from the start. By the end of book 5, he's my favorite. His vulnerability, competence, and straightforward honesty were so refreshing for a romance hero. I loved how he recognized his own flaws / weaknesses and sought to work on them. I loved how he owned them and didn't make his shortcomings about Catalina. I can't wait to find out what happens in book 6! (releasing August 2022)
