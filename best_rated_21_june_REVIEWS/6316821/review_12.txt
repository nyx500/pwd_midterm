What a fantastic ride this was.I'm incredibly sad to be done with this series. Now I know what a book hangover is all about. I truly wish Mr Butcher would write a sequel but that's wishful thinking on my part. But honestly, anyone enjoying high fantasy novels should give this series a try.___________________________________Find more reviews and book recommendations on my blog.Find me on Bookstagram.
