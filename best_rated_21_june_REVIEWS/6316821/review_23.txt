The world of Alera is facing its greatest enemy, an enemy so powerful and unstoppable that it simply can’t be beaten with the power of opposing armies. It calls for innovative solutions, creative thinking, and sheer guts to be able to surmount the odds. Perhaps a little insanity would also help. Who better than Tavi (Gaius Octavian), as he has shown time and time again, to be the one to lead the Alerans and their allies to victory?The final volume in the 6-book ‘Codex Alera’ series manages, somehow, to achieve what it needed to in order to bring this epic story to a fitting conclusion. Each of the previous five books had upped the stakes, so much so as to make it nigh impossible to ramp up the epicness any further. But somehow, Jim Butcher managed to do so. It’s always fun to read depictions of heroic battles where every time the good guys think they might have a way to get ahead (or at least not be blasted into oblivion), the plan crumbles under the weight of the bad guys’ superior ability. That happens many times in this one novel so that everything seems hopeless.The battle sequences are many and long and I missed the non-battle type scenes that made the earlier books so good. I suppose I didn’t need more characterization because I feel I already knew all the main characters well after the previous books, but I need a healthy balance of strategy and discussion as well as old fashioned conversation mixed in with the action. There are a few such scenes here but they are overwhelmed by the sheer scope of the war taking place. Overall, this is a fine epic fantasy series that I enjoyed immensely. I would rate the series as a whole with a solid five stars.
