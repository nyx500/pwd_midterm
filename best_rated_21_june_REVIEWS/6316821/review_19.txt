It all came back to Calderon. The furyless boy who stopped a barbarian invasion ,the Academ who saved the First Lord's life,the Captain who fought for years the Canim and inspired everyone to follow him to death ,the Princeps who forged strong alliances became the First Lord who led his people to victory and the reason the Realm survived. To say that this book was intense is an understatement, but I can't find words sufficient to describe it. Nor can I describe my sorrow that it is over,or the relief that my heroes are safe,or the grief about the anonymous Alerans and Canim and Marat who perished trying to defend their world;I even cried for people I scarcely knew (Cereus gave a whole new meaning to the word sacrifice).I won't rumble about what a great hero Tavi is,that's pretty obvious.What I do want to share,is how much I came to like Fidelias,it surprised even me! From the first book I prayed for his death,a very agonizing one;he was a traitor, a murderer, the person who caused so much suffering, yet he redeemed himself,and his struggle to make things right was more touching than I could ever hope for! Having said that,I'll need to find out how to move on with my life, now that Codex Alera is over.Re-read it perhaps??Hail Gaius Octavian, First Lord of Alera!
