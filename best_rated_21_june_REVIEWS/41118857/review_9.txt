The Dragon Republic (The Poppy War,#2) by R.F. KuangWar, friendship and, betrayal. This book is even better than the first book in the series as it's faster-paced, darker, and action-packed. Many military strategies and battle scenes are brutal and unflinching. The author has really improved as a writer and her knowledge of history really shines as she delves deeper into the compelling world of The Poppy War. And as a middle book of the series, one of the best endings I have read.Fire and water looked so lovely together. It was a pity they destroyed each other by nature.Brilliant Sequel.
