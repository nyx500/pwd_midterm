reread update Jan 2021: Fang Runin? Her weed? I roll that. Her hand? I hold that. Her back? I got that. Her wife? I am that. Needs someone to die for her? I'll do that“Between us, we have the fire and the water,” she said quietly. “I’m quite sure that together, we can take on the wind.”I HAVE NO FREAKIN GODDAMN WORDSHere I am thinking nothing can be more epic than The Poppy War and R.F Kuang comes and smacks me across the face with THIS BOOK. The BREADTH this world has. THE DEPTH these characters have. THE COMPLEXITY of morality and relationships in this series. the HISTORICAL REFERENCING that underpin this series creating an interesting mirror of our own world. The TWISTS, TURNS AND INCREDIBLE PLOT that has given so much intricacy in this second book. The entire time reading this I just couldn't stop thinking about how no one I've read writes fantasy like R.F Kuang. She truly owns my whole assALSO, we're not gonna think about all those Zutara dynamics and how she really fucked me up with that water and fire metaphor I'm really not strong enoughDeserved 5 star for Kitay making a dick joke about Nezha regardless of anything else tbhReview to come
