this book is a black hole - it consumes everything in its path and leaves no survivors. if youve read 'the poppy war,' you already know this series was headed for inevitable darkness. this is a bleak, unforgiving installment of betrayal, heartbreak, loss, and anger. i know many readers wont like the relentless tone of this novel, but i love it. appreciate it, even. i think kuang expertly captures the feelings and atmosphere of war, regardless of how miserable it may make the reader. i also love how rins character is developing. she definitely lives in that morally gray/middle area, but the reader exists in that area right along with her. even if i didnt agree with some of the choices she made, i could definitely understand and empathise with her. the writing is a delight, as well. it feels so fresh, which should be impossible given the subject material. but the writing takes a historical influence and makes it feel modern.    the only thing preventing me from giving this five stars is the fact that the plot is so war/politics/strategy heavy. which is such a silly thing to complain about, i know. i know this is a war-based historical fiction fantasy novel/series, but its the fantasy elements that really draw me into the story and sell it. i wish i could enjoy the war aspect more, but my eyes tend to glaze over long paragraph of tactical descriptions. thats no fault of the books, though. overall, this is a brilliant sequel. i can tell kuang has grown as a writer since her debut. she was strong before, but now she is straight up lethal and i fully expect the next book in the series to be the death of me. ↠ 4.5 stars
