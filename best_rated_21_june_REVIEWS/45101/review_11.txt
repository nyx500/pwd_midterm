The second book in this trilogy has the Vestrit family members all over the place.Althea is in the Ophelia and doing a good job at it but her thoughts are all about recovering her ship Vivacia. She dreams of being able to be back on her ship and sailing her. Ronica and Kefrria are trying to deal with the loss of their family fortune and keeping their house and holdings the best way they can.Malta is still behaving like an obnoxious and selfish kid but as the story progresses, I can see hints of a different person emerging.Wintrow is a captive onboard the Vivacia. He's shocked when he realizes that Kennit has started charming the ship and stirring her into piracy. He also starts believing that Kennit is not all bad.Amber wants to protect Paragon from getting destroyed. She wants to buy him to avoid the liveship from being chopped into pieces.Brashen finds himself close to piracy too until he hears that Vivacia has been taken by Kennit. He will go back home to alert the Vestrits of her capture. They all know that they will need help getting Vivacia back and Paragon might be the answer to their prayers.The Mad Ship sets up a good foundation for the end of the trilogy. All the Vestrits are in danger one way or the other and Hobb never makes things easy for any of them. Although, not as hard as they were for Fitz. Great character development especially with Malta and an amazing woven and intricate world-building as always. Cliffhanger: No4/5 FangMrsLeif's Two Fangs About It | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram
