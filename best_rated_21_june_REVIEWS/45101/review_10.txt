*** 4.75 ***"...“Tomorrow owes you the sum of your yesterdays. No more than that. And no less.”...An amazing story, beautiful prose, complex characters, but I feel there could have been about a quarter edited out... At least. Sometimes I miss the brevity of the writing in the forties and fifties... I know the more detail the better chance for the reader to connect with the character, but sometimes less is more.
