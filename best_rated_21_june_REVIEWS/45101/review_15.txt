Another 5 stars for a book by Robin Hobb. Shocker I know!The Mad Ship is the sequel to Ship of Magic. The Vestrit family liveship, Vivacia has been taken by the self proclaimed pirate King, Kennit. When Althea discovers that the ship that she should have inherited has been captured, she sets out with Brashen Trell and the Paragon, a ship who has lost 2 crews previously and been beached ever since.There are so many story lines running through this book I'm not sure how Robin Hobb keeps them straight. There is the point of view of Kennen, Vivacia, Althea, Brashen her mother, her nephew, her niece... The list goes on and on. Within these characters a found those I liked and those I hated, but the wonderful thing about Robin Hobb's characters is that they are never static. They are changing. And one that you hated in one book, could completely be redeemed in another book.I found that this is still the case with this book, as Malta fell into my good graces, and Serilla fell out of them.Great characters combined with the vast world that Hobb has created make these a must read.This is quickly becoming a favorite series, and I can't wait to see what the final book in the trilogy will bring.
