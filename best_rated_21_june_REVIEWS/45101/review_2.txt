Simply incredible. Somehow improves upon the first book, which was easily a 5/5Check out my new youtube channel where I show my instant reactions to reading fantasy books seconds after I finish the book.WOW! I loved everything about this book, and am shocked that it took me this long to get to it. I had no idea how much I needed a fantasy pirate series in my life, and simultaneously saddened that I think I'm probably reading the pinnacle of this type of book that will likely never be topped.The first book had a much needed slow burn at the beginning to establish the characters, but this book didn't need any of that and gets right into the action. The characters continue to receive more development in a positive direction, and the new locations that are explored are extremely interesting and unique. It's rare to read a fantasy book that shifts POVs and equally enjoy them all, but that's the case in this book. It's also rare to read a fantasy trilogy and have the middle book deliver in such a positive way, as the book usually has trouble being interesting enough while also serving as a setup for the finale. But this book knocked it out of the park.I cannot wait to read the final book in this series, and based on the reviews it's clear that it continues this trend of improvement on each book in the series.
