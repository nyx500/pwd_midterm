The five star rating is of course a matter of taste.David Gemmell is (was) one of the most gifted writers of this type of fantasy ever. It's hard to compare him to anyone else as he's sort of in a class by himself. Some compare him to Glenn Cook (whom I also like) but there are only "some" similarities. I suppose if I must come up with a "tag" I'd call Gemmell's work "heroic fantasy", sometimes "dark". While it would be incorrect to say his heroes "always" die, it is true to say that if the story calls for it, they do.Here we meet Druss (who we can find in a younger state in other writings) one of his archetypal heroes. I like Gemmell tremendously and also respect what I know of him. I found a few interviews and such with him and discovered an amazingly interesting man.I am going to risk a spoiler here...Druss and the Drenai defenders hold up in Dros Delnoch (a Drenai fortress that [of course:] has never fallen) and are (except for a few) willing and ready to defend the fort to the end (ala the Alamo, Thermopylae, etc.) In an interview Gemmell once spoke of a "reader" who wrote him and expressed a lack of understanding as to why the defenders would stay once it became obvious they couldn't hold and would be slaughtered. Gemmell said he wrote the person back and simply recommended that they not read any more of his (Gemmell's) work as if they didn't understand, he couldn't explain it to them.Gemmell died at 58 years of age in 2006 of coronary artery disease. Many (myself among them) will miss him.
