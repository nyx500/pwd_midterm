An awesome BR with Lovely Pinky and my fellow Catman, two faithful Cat-holics.“Get rid of your doubts. Yesterday is dead. Past mistakes are like smoke in the breeze. What counts is tomorrow..”I love epic fantasy <3 Fantasy books rarely let me down and “The Legend” sure didn’t. Opening such a book I look for a promise from the author, I want to dive into the rich, picturesque world, intriguing narrative, and of course gripping characters with true to life personalities (and of course with names I have difficulties to pronounce :D) That’s what I seek for in my fantasy reads 😊Did I get this in this book? Not quite, but I can say for sure that it’s an outstanding read.Characters. As is typical in many fantasy series, there is a big cast of characters. I liked them all, starting with Druss, a true hero, a legend, brave, strong, old and tired, but determined to die with his axe Snaga in his hand. Virae, a high-born, ferocious kick-ass heroine I love meeting. And many more. They pretty much make the story. Each character has it’s role and their heroic efforts make “The Legend” an epic read. For example, Gan Orrin, a disrespected commander with not much strength, or Rek, an unreliable bastard. Their stories clearly show that the most ordinary of men can become legendary heroes.“Man alone, it seems, lives all his life in the knowledge of death. And yet there is more to life than merely waiting for death. For life to have meaning, there must be a purpose. A man must pass something on -otherwise he is useless.”DrussOh and the great secret and peculiar monks with an albino Serbitar. They definitely added spices to the story not only using their great fighting skills, but also using their outstanding powers in metaphysical level. All of them come together for what it seems a long lost battle. Despite the strength, bravery and heroism, most of the characters don’t have much points in complexity or depth. Some make surprising developments, but sometimes their backstories or personalities are woven with simplicity. For example Virae, I loved following her in the first part of the book, she has potential as an independent strong woman, but in the other part of the story she was almost left to play a random role, also the insta love angle, IDK, It seemed a bit too rushed and not very real, maybe too smooth? But I confess, the ending for it just blew my mind. I liked Bowman, the witty peculiar Robin Hood and the seductive yet troubled Caessa. Their backstories and personalities were the ones where Mr. Gemmell showed his skill in creating memorable characters.Bowman and CaessaNarrative. Where “The Legend” is successful, is its pacing. No long speeches or tiring descriptions, just quick pace, adventures, fighting and death! Wow, Mr. Gemmell makes Erikson proud and harvests his characters with eagerness! The story is not overly complicated, as some of the plots and sub-plots can be in long series like Malazan, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.Siege of Dros DelnochTo sum up, I enjoyed "The Legend", and it’s really a great fantasy read. I liked the development of some characters, enjoyed the fighting and the ending was just amazing! I will read other books in the series for sure.
