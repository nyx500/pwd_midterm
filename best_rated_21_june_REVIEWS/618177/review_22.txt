This marvellous debut heroic fantasy, the book is from 1984 but it still reads as fresh now as then, is the 1st volume of the "Drenai Saga" series, from the author, the late David Gemmell.Storytelling is of a superb quality, the story is wonderfully structured and executed as a whole, and all the characters come tremendously to life within this very exciting heroic adventure.The characters featuring in this gripping heroic fantasy can be related to Romans, Celts, Mongols, Vikings, and some others, even some with the power of Holy Angels, and they are beautifully intertwined into each other when dealing with life and death, and their individual behaviour in time of war and destruction.The book is mainly set in and around the fortress of Dros Delnoch, with the main protagonist, Druss the Legend, functioning as the spearhead of an army of resistance of 10.000 men, against the overwhelming hordes of Ulric and his native tribes.Also very important characters are Reg(nak) and his wife, Virae, the Gan of Dros Delnoch, Orrin, Hugon, Leader of the Legion, and The Thirty, with the likes of Serbitar, Vintar, Menahem, Arbedark and Antaheim as their main representation, while also Gilad and Bregan will make a formidable pair in the defence of the fortress.After quite an entertaining and dangerous journey Reg, Virae and The Thirty will arrive at Dros Delnoch, just when the ultimate battle for survival is about to start, with Druss as their legendary leader in their midst, giving them all his determined leadership, inspiration and courage.What will follow is a terrific heroic fantasy tale where all different kinds of people will clash with each other for supremacy and the holding/taking of the famous fortress, till death will take them, but also where brotherhoods are forged, and all these events are brought to us in a magnificent tale about heroes who will fight for honour, freedom, love and comradeship, and a fantastic heroic tale that will linger within the hearts of young and old.Highly recommended, for this is heroic fantasy telling at its very best, just as fresh now as then in 1984, and that's why I simply want to call this: "Legendary Heroic Fantasy"!
