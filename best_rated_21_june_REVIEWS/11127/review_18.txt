Done reading THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. This edition I own contains the seven unabridged books arranged in chronological order.Author's Writing Style: 5 stars!!! It is ideally written for children in third-person POV in past tenses. The written narration is easy to read and understand (...except for its small font size which can be torturing to the eyes especially for the sleep-deprived). Pacing is fast, it's not wasting time for descriptions. Character/s Development: 3 stars!!! Aslan is my number one favorite character. This is an ideal choice, I know, but I love the idea that everyone respects, and at the same time, fears him due to his reputation. Aslan receives more pagetime in The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe - the second book in the series. I get to see how he submits himself to vulnerability and how he bounces back after being bullied. Not a fan of him but Edmund makes a mark on me. In Books 4, 5 and 7, he proves to himself that he is someone special after betraying his siblings due to Turkish Delight.Plot: 3 stars!!! I commend the series for having a different plot in every book. I mean, the main characters are children, yes, but it doesn't always follow a strict and predictable formula. For example, Book 2 - The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe and Book 3 - The Horse & His Boy tell a different inspiring story without putting similar feels in the plot quality. Book 3 is my top favorite it terms of plot. It delivers, it connects, it finishes strong. I am a bit disappointed with the "travel for a rescue mission plot" in Book 5 - The Voyage of The Dawn Treader. This book heavily reminds me of the plot used in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson & The Olympians. And the ending in Book 7 - The Last Battle gives me a real good punch, I need a moment to ponder about that.
