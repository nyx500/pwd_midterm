You guys, I could cry. I cannot believe I waited two and a half years for this. At least now I'm just sad and disappointed. Last night when I finished I was practically foaming at the mouth.500 pages of awesome and 100 pages of crap. Tunstall, really?? Tunstall a traitor? A stupid traitor, at that, as if those people would ever let him live for longer than it would take to stick a knife in his back. A stupid traitor would would let one lousy night in the household of a cruel noble who buys all this Gentle Mother garbage overwhelm everything he knows and loves about his Lady, who adores him just as he is? That he would steal her agency and beggar his own sense of honor, for a pipe dream? Bullshit. If Pierce wanted Tunstall as a traitor so bad, she could have at least bothered to make it realistic. An accident, or an unnoticed spell, maybe. Through the whole climactic fight, I thought he was an illusion of Tunstall sent to trick her by one of the mages. Even a genuine act of betrayal on the road, admitted and atoned for. But that was utter nonsense, not that Beka noticed or cared all that much, wrapped up as she was in "her man." Who I liked as a character and can't even enjoy now, given the way this ended.Bah. What a waste of a series, after all the interesting plots that came before.
