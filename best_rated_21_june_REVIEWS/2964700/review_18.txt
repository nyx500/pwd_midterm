4.5/5: 5 stars: ADespite being a teensy bit too long, I loved this story. Beka and Achoo are such a great team and with the addition of Pounce, Farmer, Tunstall and Sabine this was an interesting quest from start to finish.There were a few sad aspects to the story but you have to expect that when dealing with treachery, slavery, and power hungry bad guys. I really enjoyed the role of the women in this one and, having read Alanna: The First Adventure years ago, it was great to read the story of one of the famous ancestors in that book.
