I rated it a one star because of the way the traitor part was written. It made it unbelievable, and I got detached from the story because of that. The motives were poorly put together seeing as the character had been told time and again that he had already gained the love of the one he sought. If I would have written the book, I would have made it so that he was doing it out of anger from a betrayal, not for the love of someone he already had. It was so pointless. Also, anyone else notice that her head and arm look way off on the cover?
