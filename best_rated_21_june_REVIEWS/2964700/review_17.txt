I've loved Tamora Pierce since middle school. I've had issues with her writing every now and then (trials and hazards of out-growing the age group a favorite author writes for), but by and large I know I'm in for a good read every time I pick up her books. Which is why I was so surprised to read the last book in Beka Cooper's series. For starters, part of the reason Pierce's books are so great is because of their strong supporting characters. Mastiff kept very few of the characters we've come to know and love in the first two books, and replaced them with a character I found utterly boring. Beka's books were great because Pierce showed us this rich lower city life we had yet to fully explore in her world. In Mastiff, this was taken over by a fairly typical quest that we've seen before in both Alanna and Kel's series. I don't know if Pierce was going for a more realistic or gritty read, but I think her choices, particularly regarding Tunstall and the pairings, made absolutely no sense. It's also a little troubling to me that the only main character in the series mentioned to be a foreigner/POC turns out to be the traitor, especially considering how out of the blue this development seemed. I enjoyed the other books in the series and own them, but as far as I'm concerned, the series ended after book 2.
