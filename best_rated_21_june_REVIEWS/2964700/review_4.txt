You know, the more I think about this book, the less I like it. I was bored for the first 400 pages, then it got good for about 100, then it got horrifically bad, then it ended, then there was a stupid epilogue.I don't usually post negative reviews, especially of authors who had a major role in shaping me as a reader and writer. Tamora Pierce's Tortall books--the first two quartets, at least--singlehandedly turned me into a lifelong reader. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed in MASTIFF.My biggest complaint, obviously, was the Tunstall betrayal. I didn't buy it. I still don't. The character at the end of this book is not the same character we've loved for 1200 pages. You can't just take a shining upstanding character and turn him into a traitor. You have to lay groundwork. You have to explain the betrayal before the reader realizes it's happening, otherwise it's just going to come off as a cheap, desperate plot device. Secondly, this ENTIRE SERIES, including the beginning of MASTIFF, has been leading up to some sort of resolution between Rosto and Beka. We're cheated out of it. Rosto appears on maybe three pages, and instead we're given a relationship that is satisfying but WAY too fast and, again, not really authentic. I could go on--about the mediocre pacing, the occasional anachronistic language, and the general lack of energy--but honestly, I think my time is better spent finding something better to read.
