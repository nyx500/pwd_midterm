I did enjoy this book, though it was somewhat disappointing. Beka makes a good protagonist, though not quite as good as Kel, but my favorite character in this series is still Pounce. The almost total absence of characters like Erskan, Goodwin, and Beka's rogue friends lessens the books ability to provide a satisfying conclusion to the series.  Tunstall's betrayal caught me off guard, but not in the pleasant, "Oh-ho! Now I see what you were doing, you clever author!" kind of way. More like the, "Hey! This isn't consistent with my understanding of the story!" kind of way. I felt like there wasn't enough of a lead-up to it, and it (at least partially) undermined the attachment to the character Pierce builds for us in the earlier books. He deserved better than to be killed off as a clumsily tragic/climactic plot device. Also, I was irritated by Master Farmer. Not that the mage's character was unpleasant or poorly developed; I've just been a firm supporter of Team Rosto from book one. Having a new wonder man pop out of nowhere just when we'd gotten Dale safely bundled off felt a great deal like cheating. Pierce's mages are generally also overpowered, since they can heal AND evoke AND still wear armor. As a DM who works hard in keeping his games balanced, I do not approve. I also think that the flashy magic distracted from the grittier and more interesting aspects of Dog work and Beka's own powers.  That said, Pierce always spins a good yarn. Like Achoo, one wants to follow the trail to its finish. The cameo appearances by the Black God and George Cooper were also appreciated.
