LORD HAVE MERCY! THIS BOOK!I was so afraid to go into it because I just knew everyone was going to die and that would be it, THEN END! Yes, people died. Yes, I let out some tears at parts. Yes, it was amaze balls. Yes, there was a lot of blood and violence. Yes, there was evil and magic and good. YES! YES! YES! I love Rhy, Kell, Lila and Alucard so much. I even started to love ole Holland. There are other side people too. ‚ù§There is so much stuff going on. It starts right out of the gate and just doesn't really stop. Maybe a break here and there but not too much. I think this was a perfect ending to this trilogy. And I love that Lila is a bad@ssed woman in the book! I love when author's add a woman that can kick arse and take names. "Tell you what, " said the first attacker. "If you beg, we'll make it quick."Lila's blood sang the way it always did before a fight, clear and bright and hungry. "And why," she said, "would I want to rush your deaths?""Cocky bitch," growled the second. "I'm gonna fu--"Her knife hissed through the air and embedded itself in his throat. Blood spilled down his front as he clawed at his neck and toppled forward, and she made it under the next man's guard before the body hit the ground, driving her serrated blade up through his chin before the first blow caught her, a fist to the jaw. She went down hard, spitting blood into the street. Heat coursed through her limbs as a hand grabbed her by the hair and hauled her to her feed, a knife under her chin. "Any last words?" asked the man with the rotting teeth. Lila held up her hands, as if in surrender, before flashing a vicious smile. "Tyger, Tyger," she said, and the fire roared to life.If you haven't read this trilogy and have been wanting to, I suggest you get on it because it's freaking awesome!
