I was incredibly excited to read the last book in this series and wow was it action packed. Almost too much if that's possible. I definitely enjoyed it (and recommend it!) but it wasn't as good as the two other ones in my opinion. I overall liked how things were wrapped up at the end but I felt like Lila's character was a bit one-dimensional.More in my wrap up at the end of the month!
