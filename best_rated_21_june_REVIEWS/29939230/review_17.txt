DNF 39%Disclaimer: It's not the book, it might just be me! Here is the thing, i thoroughly enjoyed Darker Shades of Magic and Gathering of Shadows! However, having to wait an entire year has ruined this series for me. I no longer care about the plot or give any shits about what happens to these characters. I've simply moved on, it seems. This is precisely why i loath starting unfinished series. I am sure it's not a bad book but since i didn't like however much i read, i can't rate it any higher. (based on what i read)There is no character development whatsoever. AH, it bothers me so much. (except Holland)Lila, let's talk about her first. What is the matter with her? I didn't mind her recklessness in the first book, quite enjoyed it actually. In the second book, however, it was getting a little too ridiculous. i also saw others complaining about it as well, i still decided to overlook it. STUPID ME! This one was just way over the top! This has got to stop. It was just annoying and unrealistic. I couldn't read this bullshit any longer let alone actually take it seriously. Kell. My precious baby Kell. Oh, how i loved you for years, Kell! You people probably don't have any idea how much I appreciated a character like Kell, who isn't a cliched alpha male crap. (that seems to be the most recent trend in YA *rolls eyes*) His loneliness, him wanting to just belong somewhere got me, man! He seemed totally out of character in this last book. He was whiny and boring AF. Not a great combination, I must say. I can't stand them as a couple!! They didn't have to be romanticly involved. It felt forced. I've always had an extremely hard time imagining Lila being in a relationship with anyone. IT'S MANON BLACKBEAK ALL OVER AGAIN!!! I'm disgusted and disappointed. Then there are Rhy and Alucard, who i absolutely, 100% do not give a shit about. I wanted to keep reading this for Holland.. maybe one day I'll finish it. Just for him.
