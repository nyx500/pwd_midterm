It wasn’t a question. But it sparked something in Lila, rekindled the fire in her eyes and ignited a grin. “Without a doubt.”“Then why are you smiling?”“Because,” she said, “bad ideas are my favorite kind.”It’s no secret (if you know me at all) that I identify as Lila Trash™, and @allthehaters, here's a list of reasons why LILA BARD IS AWESOME AND YOU'RE WRONG:1. SHE SINGLE HANDEDLY RESCUED KELL FROM A PARALLEL UNIVERSE FROM A CAGE PROTECTED BY THE SHARPEST KNIGHT IN WHITE LONDON2. She's fucking badass.3. She's Lila Bard and she doesn't give a damn.My friend (who hated Lila) said she wasn't as annoying in this book. And I suppose, in a sense it's true - she went through a hell lot of character development. She hated goodbyes, but she said them. She hated caring, but she cared anyway. She wanted to run, but she stayed anyway. These subtle changes were far more powerful than any words could be. If book #1 was Kell and book #2 was Lila, this was Holland. Holland, who V.E. Schwab ships with sadness. Holland, who lost everything but still fought for his world. Holland, who broke my heart because FUCK NOBODY DESERVES SO MUCH PAIN.The bodies piled. Athos watched. Astrid grinned. Holland’s hand moved on its puppet string. And his mind screamed until it finally lost its voice.  - Kell x Lila: They kiss so much?? Honestly I should have kept count of how many times they kiss because they’re rushing off to danger every two seconds and just kiss before all the time just for luck you know - also LILA ALMOST DIED and kell breaks apart and jfc he carries her back and hugs her and MY HEART  - Rhylucard: I SHIP THEM SO MUCH. SO DAMN MUCH.  - I swear, 75% of my highlights from this book are rhylucard moments because they're so precious honestly“Luc?” rasped Rhy.“I’m here,” answered Alucard. “I’m here. Stay with me.”He tried to speak, but his heart slammed against his ribs as if trying to break through.It redoubled, then faltered. - He woke up and called him luc my heart is over he was dying and what he thought of what said was luc jfcAlucard clutched his lover’s hand. - HE CALLED HIM HIS LOVER I AM DEAD I AM DYING - THE WORLD WENT TO HELL AND YOU KNOW WHAT ALUCARD’S REACTION WAS: All that mattered - all that would ever matter - was this.Rhy was alive. - I mean, how can you not cry reading that? Also can we talk about Kell on Rhylucard & Alucard walking in on Kell and Lila because it's the best thing ever:   - I love Protective Kell™ so much “I told you to keep him safe, not cuddle” - also this:“Kell,” she said, the word something between a whisper and a gasp. And then the door burst open. Alucard stood in the doorway, soaking wet, as if he’d just been dumped in the sea, or the sea had been dumbed over him. “Stop fucking with the ship.” - I have never laughed so much in my lifeThis book is a monster. Actually - V.E. Schwab is a monster. A beautiful cold hearted monster who will stop at nothing less than my death. Well? There you have it. A GODAMM PERFECT ENDING.This is why I run. Because caring was a thing with claws. It sank them in, and didn’t let go. Caring hurt more than a knife to the leg, motor then anything that bled or broke and healed again. Caring didn’t break you clean. It was a bone that didn’t set, a cut that wouldn’t close.  VERDICT: VICTORIA SCHWAB HAS SHATTERED ME AND I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL EVER BE FINE. WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT EVERYBODY ON THIS PLANET NEEDS THIS TRILOGY IN THERE LIFE. pre-review(s) because I'm trash lmaoupdate: IT'S HERE OH MY GOD I'M SCARED TO ACTUALLY READ IT WTFanother update because I CAN'T CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT WHAT IS THIS LIFE I NEED THIS BUT I CAN'T READ IT will probably skip school and read it the second it comes out because yes I'm Trash honestly I've never wanted anything in my life so much?? ALSO I HEARD THERE'S DEATH I WILL SUE IF THERE'S DEATH(messages from me to may and honestly i'm mad because nobody's as excited for this as I am HELLO IT'LL BE THE END OF AN ERA) (also i feel like it's been a lot of time since I said this but I LOVE LILA BARD just an update)Do you know what I just realised? (yes this is an update because I thought I was ready, guess what I'M NOT)This book releases in 18 days.Which is to say, 432 hours.259200 minutes.15552000 seconds till we get more Kell and Lila and Alucard and Rhy.I know it's not accurate. Fight me.
