This series was fantastic. The artwork by Alan Lee was beautiful too. That Tolkien imagined this wonderful world so long ago is amazing! He was ahead of his time in creativity & imagination. Seems to me he paved the way for other writers to embrace & run with their imaginations & creativity & even bogus ideas. My beloved Harry Potter series for example is a definite distant relative to Lord of the Rings. They always compare Harry Potter to the Twilight saga but they aren't similar in the least. It is however evident to me that J.K. Rowling has definitely read, & most definitely enjoyed, LOTR. & since Harry Potter is my favorite series ever I also enjoyed LOTR. I recommend this series to anyone wanting to defy reality for a while & enter a magical world full of brave souls full of heart & wonderful senses of humor that will bring a smile to your face every few pages. I shall now give the movies a chance & see how well they fared in comparison to these wonderful books.
