What can I say? I just love Orlando B… arrgh I mean Legolas! And Glorfindel! And Haldir! And Elladan and Elrohir! And all the elves.. sigh! Oh, wasn´t there Aragorn, Gandalf and some hobbits too? And weren´t they pursued by evil orcs while wandering through the forest? I think a ring was also playing a main part…I fell instantly in love with these books when I read them for the first time ( I think I was about fifteen that time) and I´m still fond of them. Yes, some people and books are destined to be together for a lifetime… nods head
