Man, there is a reason why George Martin is doing this. Leave him be, if you want the books to be good then stop harassing the poor man! He's got enough on his plate already, and us hating and commenting harsh stuff to him isn't gonna help. At least give some appreciation as to what he has done for us fans. Stop complaining and just wait. PS: I pre-ordered this book. I'm looking forward to more of Westeros. Thank you very much, George Martin. =_=|||
