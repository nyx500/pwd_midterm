This book is utter garbage. The writing is just awful and reads like something written by a verbose teenager. it's also completely useless as a reference guide since much of the "information" is purposefully incorrect since it is "written from the PoV of a Maester and what a maester would believe is correct". What this really means: it's basically them writing in mistakes because the series is incomplete and the information within subject to change. This is why most reference material for fantasy literature doesn't come out until the completion of the story. This appears to be a substandard book released as a cash grab to capitalize on Game of Throne's (TV show) popularity. I would avoid it. Even as a massive ASOIAF and GRRM fan myself... It's probably also worth noting for the uninitiated, this was not written by GRRM, but two "super fans" of dubious reputation. Neither of whom is a professional writer.
