—4.5 stars—“I am no man’s weapon.”————about the book————Age: A (but could be enjoyed by all ages)Genres: high fantasy, sapphic romance,Cliffhanger: loose ends—can’t wait to see where Samantha goes next with this series!Writing: 9/10Quotes: 9/10World building: 10/10Characters: 8/10Romance: 7/10My rating: 9/10‼️slight spoilers below‼️———my thoughts———Tunuva is a sister of the Priory, trained to fight wyrms. Glorian is the daughter of two monarchs, but happiest in their shadow.Dumai is a godsinger, who has spent her life trying to wake the dragons from their eternal slumber.But when Dreadmount erupts, bringing with it an age of terror and violence, these women must find the strength to protect humankind...I loved Priory, but I adored this.I don’t know why, but I just felt so much more connected to characters, and loved them so much!Characters tend to be what makes or breaks a book for me, and these characters definitely made it!Glorian, Tunuva, Dumai, Esbar, and Nikaya, this cast of women were everything to me.What I particularly love about this series, this world, and Samantha Shannon’s writing, is how she writes female relationships.Not just the beautiful sapphic relationships, but also the grandmothers, the mothers, the sisters, adopted or birth, they were an absolutely stunning representation of how women can protect and help each other.Glorian was my favourite character, and I was constantly flipping between being worried about her and wanting to hug her, to being astonished at how brave and fierce this 17 year old is!She is in all ways, truly a queen.How she cared for her daughter, how she cared for her people, her kingdom, was so powerful, and I loved her all the more for it.Tunuva was my other favourite, and again, the relationship she had with Siyu is so wholesome and beautiful, in my eyes, she was a better mother than Esbar.Samantha Shannon’s writing, as always, is incredible! The way she describes the world—I was completely immersed!I stayed up reading this book until I was actually drifting off! Having to put this book down was so hard, especially as it’s better in large chunks, so you can get fully into it!There’s this message I kept seeing throughout this book, these women trying to balance their relationships—be romantic or family—and the role the world has given them.And they did it for the most part, but you can see how Esbar chose her people over her daughter a little, and how Glorian is desperately trying to do both.The romance is probably the weakest part, but is in no way bad. Just a little quieter and more of a backdrop than I’d like, but the chemistry was very much there! I’d have loved to see a love interest for Glorian (because she’s my bby), but there was too much happening right now!The plot, like Priory seemed all over the place and confusing at first, but it’s not. It’s just that there’s lots of different pieces in this world, and it takes some time to get used to them all.So why not a five star you ask?Well, a little like Priory the ending felt a little anticlimactic.There was this sense of “that’s it?” But that’s also a testament to how much I loved it!———characters ———Glorian: brave and fierce, she’s my baby and I love her🥺Tunuva: projective and caring, she’s so sweet!Dumai: clever and never quite believing she was enough, she’s not my favourite, but I love how she’s not afraid to stand up for herself.Wulf: I haven’t really talked (typed?) about him, because I was focusing on the women, but he’s one of my favourites! He’s so sweet, and I just wanted to hug him too!————quotes————“The world is not always kind. But we will try, as long as we can, all of us. All women can be sisters. We will be yours.””I will bear the fruit, I will be the unyielding vine, and then I will fight to the bitter end.”“Each and every star appeared to splinter into thousands more, the dark sky dazzling with dragons.”“When I was on the battlefield, I had to make hard choices, choices that meant life or death. Your mother does the same. The only difference is her battlefields are council chambers, her weapons are letters and treaties, and her armour is Virtudom itself.”————song————Empire -NeoniHoney -HalseyVictory -Kendra Dantes———random extra thoughts———Bonus quote (just because it made me laugh):“Madam, that is a fish.”Thanks for reading!❤️
