The setting is 500 years before the event in The Priory and the Orange Tree. I thought that the first book was fantastic but this one just blew me away. This book can be read as a standalone but if you have read the first book you will be amazed what this author done in this book. Beautifully written and richly descriptive, masterful story telling and wonderful characters. Another big book but I just flew through it. I was completely immersed in the lives and loves of this land. I really can't wait to read more from this very talented author. This book deserves more than five stars and is a MUST READ for all readers of this genre. Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the ARC in return for giving an honest review.
