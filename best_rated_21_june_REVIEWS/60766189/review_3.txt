Samantha Shannon has done it again, with an epic fantasy that truly deserves that title. This book is a beast at nearly 900 pages, but never does it feel its length. The world is rich and explored in such great depth that itâ€™s impossible not to be enamoured. There is no shortage of history or stories to tell in this world, let alone in this very book. On that note, there are a great number of characters we follow throughout, all of whom I loved. Each was so different, from beliefs to voice, and it was nothing short of a special reading experience to go through this massive journey with each of them. I hope that there continues to be books put out from this world, because, as I said, I believe there to be many more stories to tell.
