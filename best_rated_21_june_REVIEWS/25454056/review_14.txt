This second short story collection is unfortunately the weakest part of the Witcher universe that I have read. It is not on the level of The Last Wish, the stories feel mashed together without the same sense of purpose as in the other book, and they are less exciting, less symbolic and less epic.However, I love experiencing the world of the Witcher and following Geralt of Rivia and Yennefer of Vengerberg on their adventures (even though Yennefer is dreadfully annoying in this book compared to other volumes). Sword of Destiny is also very much worth reading for a Witcher fan as it provides a proper introduction to Ciri, adding more context to the happenings of The Last Wish and the main saga.Overall, this is a decent book, although it doesnâ€™t quite fulfil its huge potential.Witcher reviews:#1 The Last Wish#2 Sword of Destiny#3 Blood of Elves
