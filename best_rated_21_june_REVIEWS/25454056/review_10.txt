I now have a YouTube channel that I run with my brother, called 'The Brothers Gwynne'. Check it out - The Brothers GwynneMy expanded review has now been placed on BookNest - BookNest - Sword of DestinySo Sword of Destiny is the second book in The Witcher Saga, but dates before The Last Wish. Many of the same characters are encountered as are many new monsters, one being a doppler.Some stories were great, such as the one that seems to be a bit inspired by the little mermaid. It was surprisingly emotional and showed a completely different side to Geralt of Rivia that I have longed to see.The story of a mimic who can change into anyone and adopt their mannerisms was hilarious, and rightly caused mayhem! Gerald showed his honourable side once again in this and calmly strode towards the solution. He can be so cool!However, it does confuse me how Geralt is sometimes completely calm and executes plans perfectly, but becomes somewhat of a bumbling man in other stories, particularly around Yennefer. So overall, Sword of Destiny was another fun experience with Geralt of Rivia in this world of monsters and hunters. His camaraderie with Dandelion was a high point once again, as were the interesting creatures that feature. I look forward to reading the other novels in the future.
