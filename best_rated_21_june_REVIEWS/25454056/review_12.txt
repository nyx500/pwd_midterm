The Bounds of Reason - ⭐️⭐️⭐️ DRAGONS and a shocking twistA Shard of Ice - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Yennefer and Geralt angst (with hints of a certain infamous stuffed unicorn 🦄 )Eternal Flame - ⭐️⭐️⭐️ An intro to Dudu and Dopplers.A Little Sacrifice - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Mermaids, love and sea monstersThe Sword of Destiny - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A lost princess, Dryads and the bonds of destiny Something More - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The fall of a kingdom, and a law of surpriseI really enjoyed this short story collection, more so than the first The Last Wish. I think it helped that I had a better grounding in the lore and history of the world, and was less put off by the odd time jumps and pacing. I will say that the second half is a lot snappier in pace, and introduces the wonderful Ciri, which helped propel this to a 4 star read for me.As always, I love Yennefer and Geralt. I love the complexity to their relationship, often with years in between their meetings, yet the undeniable love they share for each other. Destiny and more bind them together, and their exchanges are always a delight to read. I’m really excited to dive into the ‘proper’ novels in 2020 now that I feel I have a good background knowledge to our heroes.
