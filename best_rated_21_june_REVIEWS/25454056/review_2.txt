Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf 🐺In the Sword of Destiny, there is no The Voice of Reason chapters, but the action seems to flow somehow even without them because in this short stories book, there is no, let’s say, “time travelling” between the stories. They happen, thank God, at almost the same time, in a continuous present. Except for the last story that got me a bit confused (I don't really do good with stories that leap from one time to the other without telling me EXACTLY what the bloody hell they're about to do).There are also six stories here:1. The Bounds of Reason (3.5/5 ⭐)2. A Shard of Ice (5/5 ⭐)3. Eternal Flame (4/5 ⭐)4. A Little Sacrifice (4/5 ⭐)5. The Sword of Destiny (5/5 ⭐)6. Something More (5/5 ⭐)____Total rating for Sword of Destiny: 4.41/5 ⭐“Destiny has many faces. Mine is beautiful on the outside and hideous on the inside.”Here, the chapters are longer, it seems, and also there is a certain political touch to it, even almost invisible. I tended to get a bit lost sometimes, but got right back when it came to a good old action scene *winks*.I especially enjoyed A Shard of Ice. The story is based on H.C. Andersen’s tale The Snow Queen, which is one of my favourite fairy tales ever. So, of course, I enjoyed Mr Sapkowski’s reinterpretation of it. The same goes for that tiny part in The Sword of Destiny where Frexinet’s story is inspired by The Wild Swans fairy tale. Dziękuję bardzo, panie Sapkowski, I really needed that. Also, there was a Little Mermaid reinterpretation in A Little Sacrifice that I enjoyed too. This book was hardcore Andersen-inspired, apparently.Apart from that, I realised that I’m not Yennefer’s biggest fan, it tends to repel me somehow, but I don’t entirely dislike her. She’s just tough to love I guess. We also get to meet Ciri in this book and hey, that’s what I was waiting for. I also must say that her reunion with Geralt is waaay more different from the one in the TV show and it is ten times better, I'd say.
