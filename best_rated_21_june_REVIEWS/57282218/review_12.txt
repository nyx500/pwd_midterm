How to approach reviewing this one? You'll have noticed I give it one star, so I didn't like it, but there are two caveats to that:1. I am obviously not the imagined audience for this series..2. I don't want to just descend into laughing at things teenage girls like - it's condescending sexist shittiness.But, I did think it was uniquely terrible (which is also the only unique thing about it, come to think of it).This is not my first Hades/Persephone rodeo, so I know it's A Thing, but I find the whole set-up really boring. And so this is another treatment of that story that descends into soapy, drawn out romantic tropes. There's a distinct lack of characterisation, which is actually quite a feat, what with the endless conversations.Yes, there is a rape scene towards the end, but this is after all based on Greek mythology, and this at least is handled with care - in the original stories rape happens regularly and it is accepted as totally normal (Zeus specifically seemingly doesn't know impregnation can also involve consent).[Six months later addendum: That might be true, lots of rape in ye olde mythology, but I do question why you'd add that to your soapy romance that's mostly read by teens. Feels unnecessary, Rachel Smythe!]The art isn't great. It's unsurprising that each character gets their own snazzy fluorescent skin colour, as they all look the same and it's the only way to tell them apart. The women have hourglass figures, most of them have mucho boobage, they have round faces and pouty mouths. The men have upper bodies like upside down triangles, necks as thick as their heads, and pointy noses. And pointy shoes.I get it, it's a bit of romantic fun, you shouldn't take it too seriously.. but it's also unoriginal, vapid pap with rushed indistinct art.
