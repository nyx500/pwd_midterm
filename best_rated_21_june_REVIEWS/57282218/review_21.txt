A CW-fied version of Greek mythology. The Greek Gods live in an Olympus that reminds me of New York City. The Gods get a Kardashian type makeover, the characters are all rich, entitled and vapid for the most part. As my friend Al suggested, the art is very reminiscent of Kyle Baker with maybe a little Babs Tarr thrown in. It's fine but pretty basic art. For current retellings of Hades and Persephone, I much prefer what Linda Sejic is doing over in Punderworld.
