Wow. Do I have a new obsession? Probably. Wow. I knew I would love Lore Olympus, and I've known it for ages, but I've been waiting for the bind-up to come out because I really struggle with focusing on webtoons. Not sure what it is, because there are a million and one webtoons I would love to read, but I never seem to get around to them until they're printed in a bound format like this. That said, I got this as a Christmas gift from my spouse today and literally binge read it the moment I got the chance (which was maybe two hours after opening the gift). Now I'm sad that Volume One is over, I have no idea when Volume Two is coming out (please be soon, please be soon), and I'm thinking I'm going to probably finally cave and just start reading it as a webtoon because there's no way I can wait for the next volume bind-up. I miss Hades and Persephone too much already.✨ Content warnings for: sexual assault/rape, a character is drugged without consent, misogynistic jokes/comments, abusive parent———twitter | booktok | bookstagram | blog
