I can’t believe it’s over. I already feel bereft. I’m going to have the worst book hangover ever. But before I get there, here are my thoughts, reactions and quotations using progress percentage points of the kindle edition. At the very end, I noted down some interesting issues raised in the 10th anniversary spoiler stream so if you haven’t watched the stream yet, make sure to at least scroll to the end and read those – if my reading log is too long for you. (I wouldn’t blame you.) SPOILERS BELOW!!!*******0% That Michael Whelan cover is 🔥!*******PoV: Talmanes 4% This horrible fight in Caemlyn makes me unreasonable angry with Mat. He should have opened Verin’s flaming letter.6% “I’ve found the secret to defeating [the Fades] […]. You just have to be dead already.“ 💔*******PoV: Moghedien7% Taim as one of the Forsaken/Chosen. Oy. Is that just a rank to be achieved or does it elevate him in the One Power? I wonder if he had ended up where he is if Rand had not given him so much authority and control.*******7% “The wheel of time turns, and Ages come and pass…“ Reading those opening lines for the last time has me all emotional.*******PoV: Rand8% So Rand is a viewpoint character again. As much as I enjoyed the indirect characterization in Towers of Midnight, it’s good to have him back.8% The first glimpse we get of Rand is him laughing. That is somehow encouraging.8% “It‘s really here […]. I’m not ready – we’re not ready – but it’s here anyway.“ My thoughts exactly, Rand.13% “Enough talk. You will bed me now.“ 😂 You just have to love Aviendha. Though I’m still not sure how I feel about Rand having three lovers.*******PoV: Egwene17% I grow increasingly tired of Egwene’s attitude towards Rand. Calling him sheepherder still – and not with affection as Min does, but with condescension, and then opposing him at every turn when so much is at stake? Really?18% Yes! Moiraine to the rescue of this snafu of a meeting.*******PoV: Perrin19% The Dragon‘s Peace. Oh how I hope it will save the Aiel from their disastrous fate.*******PoV: Rand24% I like how Sanderson balances battle scenes with emotional, character-driven ones. Here, Rand’s reaction to Elayne’s pregnancy was both beautiful and sad. “Please do not name either child after me, Elayne. Let them live their own lives. My shadow will be long enough as it is.”******PoV: Elayne 25% Man, without Traveling the forces of the Light would be so screwed.*******PoV: Rand29% I hadn’t considered that having Lews Therin’s memories also includes memories of having had sex with a Forsaken. Yuck.*******PoV: Egwene29% Hey, Egwene is channeling (pun intended) a Lurcher/Coinshot – or Magneto – , using metal to kill.*******PoV: Rand33% “The secret, it turned out, had not been to harden himself to the point of breaking. It had not been to become numb. It had been to walk in pain, like the pain of the wounds at his side, and accept that pain as part of him.”34% I didn’t think I would find moments of happiness in this book, but seeing Rand sparring with his father sure made me smile.*******PoV: Mat34% Mat rescuing Tuon from a Gray Man and bickering with her after? Just delightful! “I have decided not to be jealous. You are fortunate. The missing eye suits you. Before, you were too pretty. 37% Yay! Mat and Rand finally meet again after an eternity and those two are bickering just as much as Tuon and Mat have done before.“What did you do to your hand, by the way?”“What did you do to your eye?”“A little accident with a corkscrew and thirteen angry innkeepers. The hand?”“Lost it capturing one of the Forsaken.”“Capturing?” Mat said. “You’re growing soft.”37% Now that is just cool: First, Rand uses Tuon’s logic against her, makes the garden explode with life again and then seals the deal. “I extend my hand to you in alliance. The Last Battle is upon us. Join me, and fight.”*******PoV: Elayne39% I have a really bad feeling about Agelmar and Bashere. It would be too much of a coincidence that both generals miscalculate so badly with their armies.*******PoV: Egwene40% I really wish Elaida had found out Rand, via Tigraine, is part of the royal line of Andor and that he, in fact, is the key to defeating the Dark One – and that her interpretation of her foretelling was just dead wrong. But I fear I’ll have to be content with her fate as a damane. I also wonder if Galad ever finds out that Rand is his half-brother?41% What the hell is happening?? Sharans? With hundreds of channelers? Nonono. This is really bad.*******PoV: Siuan43% Bryne is the third general to make a costly mistake. I don’t like it, not one bit.*******PoV: Egwene44% Demandred. Oh that is not good. I had almost forgotten about him.*******PoV: Perrin45% I fucking knew it! There was just something fishy about the generals’ mistakes. So Graendal is Compelling them, I take it?*******PoV: Gawyn45% Oh no, Gawyn. Not the Bloodknife ring. Dead man walking.*******PoV: Egwene51% Oh snap. A battle of the wits. How disappointing that Tuon proves to be insufficiently armed against Egwene.*******PoV: Mat55% I’m not sure if the way Tuon appropriated Min as her Truthspeaker/Doomseer amuses me or makes me angry on her behalf.*******PoV: Lan56% I feel so incredible sorry for the four generals. Not even knowing you’re sabotaging your battle and to finally realize what damage you’ve done is just cruel.*******PoV: Mat57% Man, sometimes I really love Tuon. The way she trusts Mat and his mind is gratifying.60% Watching Mat be a genius battle commander is everything.*******Chapter 37: The Last Battle67% One chapter of 217 pages? This will be a hell of an epic battle, it seems.Characters I think will die: Rand (though I really hope I’m wrong about this); Gawyn because of the blood rings; either Egwene or Nynaeve but I think it’ll likely be Egwene because of Gawyn’s death – I don’t think (hope) other MCs will die but if so, it’ll likely be Perrin rather than Mat.Characters I think will survive: Mat; Perrin; Elayne & Aviendha (since both of them will have Rand’s children); Min; Tuon; Faile; Nynaeve and if Nynaeve lives, Lan; Galad; Thom; Moiraine *******PoV: Uno68% “He had tried to keep himself lean so he’d taste flaming terrible when they stuffed him in one of those flaming cookpots.“ Smart plan, Uno! 😂68% Demandred is using a circle of 72 channelers???? Holy shit.*******PoV: Pevara70% Androl is such a fun character to watch. You can tell Brandon is enjoying himself with the use of gateways. *******PoV: Rand71% How is it that evil forces often make the world an oppressive, dreary, desolate, dead place? Doesn’t sound like fun to live in. Wouldn’t it be nicer to live in a temperate, luscious, beautiful world?*******PoV: Rhuarc74% Not Rhuarc. Compulsion is such an unfair trick.*******PoV: Elayne 75% “Women are as fully capable of being evil as men. Why should one hesitate to kill one, but not the other? The Light does not judge based on gender, but on the merit of the heart.“ Go tell Rand that too, Galad. Maybe that eases his conscience.*******PoV: Min76% Siuan dead – and that so soon? I don’t like it. I guess Bryne is next based on Min‘s viewing that they would only live if they stay close to one another.*******PoV: Galad78% Even though Gawyn’s death was inevitable once he put on those rings, I felt Galad’s pain – at least he died in his brother’s arms, if not in Egwene’s. And I did get my wish: Galad learns Rand is his half-brother.*******PoV: Rand78% It finally dawns on me that Rand‘s battle with the Dark One comes down to a battle of the mind. An elegant solution, that. Not sure how a sword battle would have looked.79% This vision of a world without conscience and compassion, without the concept of good and evil, leaving people to think the Last Battle was won is so much worse than the one with an apocalyptic feel – and nicely renders my earlier complaint about it moot. This is a different, unexpected and more terrifying kind of evil.*******PoV: Elayne80% RIP Gareth Bryne. *******PoV: Mat80% “I and mine are ordered to -"“To go die on the front lines. I’m bloody working on that, Karede. Keep your sword out of your own gut for the moment, kindly.“*******PoV: Galad 81% The fact that Demandred channels during his fight with Galad shows how worried he is in the face of Galad‘s skill. Feels like cheating.81% What is happening?! No, not Galad as well!!! And not the sword arm! I really hope I wasn’t wrong about him.*******PoV: Ila (Aram‘s grandmother)85% Hold up, Hanlon is there?? What is he up to?? I see bad things happening.*******PoV: Elayne87% I fucking knew it! This is horrifying! Planning to cut her babies out?? Someone’d better help Elayne! I’m betting on Brandon not doing that but still – letting that bastard Hanlon escape has even worse consequences than I imagined. *******PoV: Min87% Why has Mat not called the Seanchan back sooner?*******PoV: Egwene88% I hate balefire. 88% Egwene is amazing! Creating a weave to oppose balefire. This is awesome! In both senses of the word.88% This is not awesome. Not Egwene. Here I am, tears in my eyes. I’m gonna need a minute.*******PoV: Rand88% “Not Egwene.” I’m with you, Rand. *******PoV: Lan89% “Some men would call it brash, foolhardy, suicidal. The world was rarely changed by men who were unwilling to try being at least one of the three.“Go, Lan, go! Kill Demandred! 89% “I am the man who will kill you.“ Hell, yeah!<89% “I did not come here to win […]. I came here to kill you. Death is lighter than a feather.” I refuse to believe that Lan is dead!89% End of chapter. The last battle doesn’t appear over though!*******PoV: Rand89% “ ‘Let go, Rand. Let us die for what we believe, and do not try to steal that from us. You have embraced your death. Embrace mine.’ […] And then, he let go. He let go of the guilt. He let go of the shame for not having saved Egwene and all the others. He let go of the need to protect her, to protect all of them.”Sounds like Rand is speaking the fourth ideal of the Windrunners.******PoV: Mat90% Of course! It just occurred to me that Mat technically died – so the Horn can now be blown by anybody! Good thing everybody was as I dense as me.*******PoV: Elayne90% Now that I really needed to see. Birgitte returning and killing that sadist Hanlon, standing over her own dead body.*******PoV: Mat90% Yay! Lan is not dead! 90% What death is Hawkwing talking about? “Another moment, one you cannot remember.” Seems I can’t remember either, like Mat. Rand saves him twice?91% Firing the dragons from inside that cave at different targets through gateways? Mat, you bloody genius! *******PoV: Jur Grady91% The people from Hinderstap! Did I mention Mat is a bloody genius?*******PoV: Padan Fain95% Of course, what this clusterfuck in the Thakan’dar valley needs is Padan Fain and Mashadar meddling. (smh)*******PoV: Mat97% At least Mat makes short work of Padan Fain. Good riddance. With Slayer finally dead as well, more loose ends are tied up.*******PoV: Rand97% Rand is doing it! Moiraine and Nynaeve finally have a big part to play. Rand is winning and it looks like he really has a chance to survive this. Go, team Light!*******PoV: Logain97% Seeing people grateful and in awe of Logain and his Asha’man is the scene I didn’t know I needed. How awful it must have been to face people fearing and hating him all his life and now to be looked upon with gratitude. What a wonderful reward; he truly attained glory *******PoV: Perrin98% Good on you, Perrin, for being able to kill a woman with no fuss. Goodbye, Lanfear. (*3)*******PoV: Rand98% “He wove something majestic, a pattern of interlaced saidar and saidin in their pure forms. Not Fire, not Spirit, not Water, not Earth, not Air. Purity. Light itself. This didn’t repair, it didn’t patch, it forged anew.” You did it Rand. Now please don’t die.*******PoV: Perrin98% Nynaeve and Perrin aren’t the only ones crying over Rand. He can’t die! After what he has given, he deserves to live with his three women happily ever after.******PoV: Moghedien 99% I’m taking a brief break in my mourning to feel a bout of schadenfreude about Moghedien being collared again.*******PoV: Nynaeve 99% What? Rand is dead? But why don’t his girls care?? This doesn’t make sense.*******PoV: Tam 99% “He did not wipe the tears from his eyes. You did well. My boy. . . you did so well. He lit the pyre with a reverent hand.” *******PoV: Min100% “Now we make sure that everyone well and truly believes he is gone.” What is happening??*******PoV: Rand100% Rand lives!! And he freaky Fridayed with Moridin? Well, at least Moridin is handsome and, more importantly, Rand has a left hand again this way and is no longer in pain. And now I’m crying again. (*2)100% So what kind of power does Rand have now that he can light a pipe like that? (*1)100% “This wind, it was not the ending. There are no endings, and never will be endings, to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was an ending.”100% I want an epilogue set 10 years later! (*4)______________________After sitting for a while in quiet contemplation, I finally watched the  Memory of Light 10th anniversary live stream  and I took some notes on a few questions that were raised. (*1) There is no canon answer to how Rand is lighting the pipe at the end. (*2) Brandon’s explanation on the body swap: RJ wanted a chance for Rand to put down the weight and go live a life. “The soul that wanted to live found the body that wanted to live and the soul that wanted to die didn’t go to the effort.”(*3) The biggest secret is revealed: Lanfear is actually alive. Her problem is that she’s basically screwed no matter which side wins: “She needed to give something plausible that when it got back to Rand – if he lived – he would believe that this all happened. The whole idea of playing with Perrin was to give as credible a witness as she possibly could to her demise, so there would be no question in the minds of the heroes.”(*4) For everyone (like me) that wanted to know where our characters go from here: Sanderson says that in the three theoretical sequel books focusing on Mat and Perrin, Rand would have time to raise his kids; Lanfear and the Seanchan would be involved, so that it’s mostly “about all the problems in the Seanchan Empire and conflicts between the two continents.” Also, he imagines “Rand makes a cameo – but it is Rand in a shack somewhere you don’t expect, and hanging out with his kids, that’s all you get from Rand, maybe some wise words, […] you’ll get some advice from Rand at some point, that’s what I would imagine would happen in those three books if they had ever gotten written.” Also, at some point in the future, Rand will realize that Lanfear is alive, but he would not intervene.More on Rand post Memory of Light: “In Rand‘s realm he is as powerful [as a Shard] or maybe more, if he is – as I imagined – the direct manifestation of the Pattern and what he wills happens, this is more powerful than a Shard because there’s no balancing factor for him, he basically can imagine something and it occurs, which should be terrifyingly powerful but, fortunately, he just wants to see the world […] as each of his women finish with the jobs that they have for themselves and join him, it’ll be the four of them seeing the world. Elayne takes the longest before she joins up.”(5) “Do I really have to spank one of the Forsaken?” Turns out yes, but that’s something Brandon would like to retcon.I wish I could say onward.
