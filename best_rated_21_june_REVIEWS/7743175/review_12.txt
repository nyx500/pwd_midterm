Where do I even start with this? So many emotions at the conclusion of this journey through The Wheel of Time. All I can say for now is Brandon Sanderson did a fantastic job bringing us to the finish line with what is easily one of the greatest fantasy stories ever told. The good far outweighs the bad throughout the series and while there are obvious flaws in the series, I can only appreciate what was written here. I'm getting emotional even writing this, knowing that I just finished the books. Rest in peace to those that we lost on our journey, your sacrifices kept the Wheel turning. Rest in peace Robert Jordan, I wish we could have seen your own vision of completing the series but you left it in great hands. Why am I feeling so emotional? Video review to come soon.
