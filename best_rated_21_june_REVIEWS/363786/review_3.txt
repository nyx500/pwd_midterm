This series is like a dark fantasy soap opera. Everything is just so over-the-top and emotional. Everyone over reacts to everything and despite that they can't seem to communicate clearly with each other. It's very Grade Seven drama, set in Hell.In this installment, the Kindred take on more substantial roles. Yup, the mind-talking horses, wolves, dogs, spiders, unicorns, etc. Jaenelle's circle are regular Doctor Doolittles. I wonder why this fantasy is so compelling that we keep repeating it? Think of the Houyhnhnms in Gulliver's Travels. In fantasy literature, there are the telepathic dragons in Anne McCaffery's Pern novels, the horse-like Companions in Mercedes Lackey's Last Herald-Mage and the wolves in Robin Hobbs' Farseer Trilogy and George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. Apparently people who love fantasy also love animals and have a burning desire to talk with them. I personally think we would be disappointed, that it would probably be like Todd and his dog Manchee in The Knife of Never Letting Go, with Manchee often telling Todd that he needs to poo.So, this series is silly fun and I'll read at least one more volume of it this year, if all goes according to plan.Book number 405 of my Science Fiction & Fantasy Reading Project.Cross posted at my blog:https://wanda-thenextfifty.blogspot.c...
