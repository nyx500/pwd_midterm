I'm not ready to let go. Do not make me do it. I will slap the shit out of you.I am pretty excited to read the other Black Jewel novels but holy ever living shit do I not want to let go of these characters. I'm honestly a little bit nauseous thinking about it.I've been through thick and thin with these characters. We've seen some fucking dark times and had some great laughs and lived in an indescribable (at least on my part) world full of magic, beauty, death, destruction, torture, kindness and love. We've gone to battle more times than can be counted and grieved for our losses while nursing our wounded. We gained unlikely and unusual friends and dealt with horrific betrayals. Yes, I said we. I was so immersed in this world that I forgot about the realm in which I actually exist.My review of the first book:  Daughter of the Blood Â  My review of the second book: I didn't do one. I couldn't bring it to words.As usual, I feel the need to warn with this series, that it is dark. Perhaps the darkest shit I've read to date. Personally, I think that makes it feel all the more real. But that also means that this series is definitely not for everyone.*cries* Please don't leave me my Khaleer friends!
