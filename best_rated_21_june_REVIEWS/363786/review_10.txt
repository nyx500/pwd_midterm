Nope. I'm done with Anne Bishop after this. I just can't go through it. Too much violence, too much rape. This is NOT fantasy book. It's romance, with a really annoying heroine, even worse love interest (HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN READ ABOUT HOW HOT AND DANGEROUS HE IS), the worldbuilding makes NO sense.And the worst thing? It had POTENTIAL. The idea is interesting as fuck. The background characters really get into you. But it's all ruined. I hate it.
