“He just hoped Meg leading the way didn’t mean all the blood prophets would do strange things to their hair.” While I didn't like this one quite as much as the first, it was an excellent follow-up that kept me glued. The world-building is fascinating and complex - I love Meg and the different creatures in Lakeside and how they interact with each other. It's dark and violent and gritty, but even the humorous parts (and there are several!) work well. The crows especially get a bigger part in the story, and I love that little group. Bad, bad humans must ruin everything as always *sigh*. The Controller plays a larger role and we get to connect with another blood prophet in a cool sub-plot and angle. It's funny but most of the actual story doesn't start skyrocketing in pace until the end, but it still lured me in since I like the charm of the town and characters so much. There's still a little too much shifting for POVs - I like the cops but dont need to be in their heads quite this much - but I still stayed focused on Meg and her bizarre prophecies, the struggle of the other blood prophets that need rescuing, what's happening with the poor crows, Simon getting more attached to Meg, and the townfolk being the fun but vicious monsters they are.I do find the way The Others are portrayed as so superior and almost holier-than-thou grating sometimes, even if humans are destructive, but I can't settle with ease on the destroy all humans and take their lands with as much enthusiasm as some of the series readers.Oh, but this book has cookies - lots and lots of cookies!!
