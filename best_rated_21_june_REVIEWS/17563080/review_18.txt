Continuing the re-read of The Others with book 2. The characters are all continuing to develop beautifully and the Lakeside Courtyard is becoming a real place for me that I am invested in. Meg and Simon are struggling to figure out the boundaries of their friendship and I love the way both of their cluelessness complicates things as they develop. My only criticism of this one is that there isn’t enough of Sam, he’s adorable and I want him all the time. The center issue in this book is that two deadly drugs have been showing up and causing the deaths of humans and The Others. These drugs and outspoken humans focusing on Humans First and Last movement are causing huge amounts of upset that could result in the loss of human life on the continent if they can’t stop whoever is using it to cause chaos.
