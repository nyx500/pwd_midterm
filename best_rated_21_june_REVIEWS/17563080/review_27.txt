I loved loved loved this book even more than the first. The world has been established and built, i have gotten to meet most of the key players, now it's really starting to dig into their pasts and motivations. there are some new characters, ones that I hope make a reappearance in the next book, Vision in Silver witch I'm starting next. This was a 5 star read!!!!! and I can't wait to see what's next for Meg, Simon and the rest of the Lakeside Courtyard.
