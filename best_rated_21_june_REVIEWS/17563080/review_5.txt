Previous rating: 3.545897468 stars. (Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I read this one very wrong the first time around.(New rating: 4.12356458 stars. (Seen the light I have! Go me and stuff!)âž½ And the moral of this reread is: not-edible exploding fluffballs for the win!âž½ And the other moral of this reread is: chick movies with no small birds in them are complete rip-offs, if you ask me.That's not exactly the type of small bird I had in mind but yeah, sure, whatever and stuff.ðŸ‘‹ Until next time and stuff.[September 2019]Actual rating: 3.545897468 stars.This one should have been thrice as deadly as the first instalment in the series was. Or wasnâ€™t. Or should have been but shockingly proved to be not. Or vice versa. Perhaps. Then again maybe not. (In case you were wondering, YES, I am feeling slightly a little bit confused as fish right now. I think.) Anyhooooo and stuff. As I was so brilliantly trying to explain, I should have DNFed this book twice as fast as I didnâ€™t DNF Written in Red. (What do you mean, this sentence makes no sense? Of course it does. Youâ€™re just not drunk enough to appreciate the full extent of its unfathomable depth and stuff.) So. Yes. I mean no. As in no DNFing this one either. Bloody stinking shrimp of the lethargic barnacle, I sure seem to be getting disgustingly soft in my old age. Iâ€™m telling you, Decades Younger Nefarious Little Me of Last Year would have unleashed the crustaceans on this deliriously slightly dull story before even getting to the third chapter. So muchâ€¦nothingness! Such deliciously irrelevant details revealed and unnecessarily stretched to deathly death! Thereâ€™s even less stuff happening than in the first book! Not to mention that the plot doesnâ€™t truly develop until you get to the last part of the story! And Meg! Sheâ€™s as flat and bland as ever! So is Simon! And there is as much chemistry between them as there is between malnourished yeti crabs and apathetic jellyfish! And Iâ€™m all for slow-burn romances but I think thereâ€™s a slight chance I might die before these two even start thinking about whether they should consider maybe getting close enough to possibly air-kiss on the cheeks! Itâ€™s wonderful! Letâ€™s dance!So why did I finish the book, you ask? Because Iâ€™m a masochist, you say? Well there is that, yes. But there is also the fact that I kinda sorta like this world a little lot. Because itâ€™s original and intriguing and stuff and I want to keep reading about it and stuff. Also, I kinda sorta like all the characters that are not Meg and Simon in the series and want to keep reading about them and stuff. (Grandpa Erebus = ðŸ’• lurve ðŸ’•) Also alsoâ€¦errâ€¦nothing really. I mean, Iâ€™m not even that interested in the whole Cassandra Sangue Thingie (CSTâ„¢). Or the in the series arc. I just want to know more about the Courtyard, its inhabitants and their daily lives. Oh my shrimp. Itâ€™s official, I need professional help. Fleet Admiral DaShrimp! Fetch Dr Prawn at once! My Once Superior Brain Cells (OSBSâ„¢) seem to be affected by a most cunning disease! Its progress must be stopped before it reaches its final stage and I start rating Young Adult Paranormal Fantasy Romances 6 stars and stuff! My thoughts exactly.P.S. Oh, in case you were wondering: Yes, crows were viciously murdered slightly harmed during the nearly non-existent development of this plots. Ooops. Spoiler warning and stuff. Youâ€™re welcome.[Pre-review nonsense]Bloody shrimping hell of the stinking fish, I liked this instalment, too! What is happening to me??!!!
