This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life in Books.I liked this book just as much, if not more, than the first book in the series. I love all of the wonderful characters in this book but I also was really drawn to the story. Meg has really sparked a lot of change in Simon and her world. I now completely understand why so many people love this series.Meg speaks prophecies but she doesn't just come out and say what is going to happen. It takes some work to put everything together. The Others seem to be very good at piecing together her warnings and they don't hesitate to act upon them. There has been an outbreak of strange behavior in both humans and the Others caused by a new drug that has resulted in a lot of deaths.There is another group in danger. The other blood prophets, like Meg, are not being cared for in the manner that everyone believes. They are used for profit and really live in a prison. Once the Others learn how things really are for this group they intervene. There are some truly heartbreaking scenes involving this group of peopleI love the characters in this book. We met nearly all of the characters in this book in the first book but the more time we spend with them the more I like them. Simon is just awesome. He confused himself but he knows that he wants to be around Meg and considers her to be his. Henry is another favorite character. He is always so peaceful and has a really gentle strength. Tess, Vlad, Jenni, and the rest of the individuals in the Courtyard are all a lot of fun.I would highly recommend this series to others. This is a second book in a series that really does need to be read in order since each book builds on the last. I can't wait to read more of this exciting world.Initial ThoughtsI am loving this series!
