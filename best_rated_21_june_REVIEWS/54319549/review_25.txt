1st reread:okay so my second time around i had so much more fun, i loved all the characters even more than the first time and it really made the book more interesting. i love the side characters, delano and naill, i hope to see more of my kings in book 3. this book had a lot of world building in the end but reading it a second time i didn’t care. this was soooo much better than my first read. 1st read:this was very much a filler book, i didn’t hate it (obvi) but i was a bit bored because the beginning dragged A LOT. i have a problem with reading big books because i tend to get bored easily so the book starting off slow was really had for me to stay interested but luckily it had great banter between the love interests and other smaller things i enjoyed
