So sooo good 🤌The angst. Oh, the ANGST.. it was PERFECT!! This one was even better than the first book. Casteel and Poppy are the superior couple and there's no fighting it. The banter and the drama is so worth reading. Kieran is an equally interesting supporting character and I would definitely like to see more of him. The ending had me screaming!! The spice was well..spicy 😏😏 I did however feel at times that there were too many dialogues and the plot was dragged on a bit unnecessarily. The pacing was inconsistent as it got a bit slow for me at times, then picked up pace only to slow down again. Regardless, I obviously want to find out what happens next. Gimme more Casteel and Poppy. Always more Casteel. The man is a total book boyfriend material and I'm all for it..er, him..er yes the book not Casteel..but definitely Casteel. To sum it up this was such a fun read, can't wait to read Casteel, er I mean the next book.
