Oh. My. God.  😍 This book is even better than the first one.*Long review ahead, #SorryNotSorry.✅ Strong main character ✅ Awesome love interest✅ Amazing secondary characters ✅ Hate/love and a lot of angst✅ Sexual tension and some sexy moments ✅ Funny and witty banter ✅ Action ✅ Pace and plot❗️❗️ Kind of cliffhanger ❗️❗️ Trigger warnings: violence, murder, and mention of cannibalism"I am born of the first kingdom." Casteel's voice carried like the wind and snow, stroking over the knights, who all turned, one by one, to look in his direction. "Created from the blood and ash of all those who fell before me. I have risen to take back what is mine. I'm who you call the Dark One," he said, and chills danced across my skin. "Yes, I have the Maiden, and I'm not giving her back."So many people told me that the second book was even better than the first one, and I was skeptical because I really enjoyed the first book, but they were right. The action, the love/hate, the angst, the plot twists... I can't find the words to explain how amazing this book is. It is the perfect mix of powerful main characters, great secondary characters (Kieran! 😍), funny banter, action scenes, political intrigue, and a slow-burning (and intense) love/hate relationship with a lot of sexual tension and steamy moments. "All you have is me. Let me be enough." ❤️A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire picks up right where From Blood and Ash ends. Poppy and Cas have a few relationship issues to work out in this book and even though the steamy scenes and the tension between them are delightful to read, I was so desperate for them to realize that the other loved them back. It created a weird mix of excitement and frustration, but it made the book so enjoyable. Their game of pretending, their conversations, and Cas's inappropriate behavior delighted me, and their intensity and protectiveness made me feel weak in the knees a few times. I love them so much (I would let Casteel do whatever he wants to me, and I would thank him for it).Honestly, for a book that’s over 600 pages, the plot does not progress that much, but I don’t care. At all. Because the interactions between the characters are so funny, cute, angsty, and heartwarming at the same time. Because Poppy showed everyone once again that she is a strong badass fighter and that she is not a meek and demure maiden waiting to be saved. Because Kieran is an awesome secondary character and I enjoyed every single interaction he had with Poppy. Because there is action, and fighting, and because this is an AMAZING BOOK.“He was the first thing I’d ever truly chosen for myself.I chose him because he made me feel like I was something other than the Maiden, and he saw me when no one else ever really did. He made me feel alive. He valued me for who I am and didn’t try to control me.”Poppy just realized that all she believed to be true about her kingdom, about the Atlantians, and about Hawke are lies, and she now has to come to terms with this stinging betrayal. She is hurt, confused, and angry (and stabby), and I loved how she remained strong through all of it, and also how she held onto her anger. She did not forgive Cas after 2 hours just because he apologized and showed his dimple. Poppy is brave and fearless at times, and her obsession with sharp objects and stabbing has become a running gag in the book, but it really made me laugh. "He has done things some might find unforgivable. Things that would haunt your sleep and leave you with nightmares long after you wake. He may hate being called the Dark One, but he has earned that name.’’ Kieran’s pale eyes meet mine as a shiver curled its way down my spine. "But he’s the one thing in all the kingdoms that you, and only you, never have to fear."Cas is trying to find a way to protect Poppy, and what better way to do it than keeping her at his side as his soon-to-be wife. The relationship between Cas and poppy becomes more intense and even more complicated the longer they spend together. There is action, fights (verbal and physical), and sexy hot scenes, and I honestly couldn't put it down. I. Love. Casteel.  Cas is as amazingly awesome as he was in the first book. He is funny, sexy, caring, intoxicating, and so many more adjectives that I can't come up with at the moment (I might be a little obsessed). “Make me feel incompetent and kill more than me, Princess.”That. 🖤That one sentence shows how proud he is of the fact that she can defend herself, doesn't think she needs him to save her or protect her, and how he likes her fierce and violent side. 🖤We were only pretending.But this felt so very real."Only on one condition," I said."You have a condition now?"I nodded, my heart thundering. "I don't want to pretend," I whispered. "I'm Poppy and you're Casteel, and this is real. Can you agree to that?"His eyes drifted shut for a heartbeat, all the striking lines of his face were tense. "Always," he whispered. "Yes." One thing that I truly ADORED in this book is the angst. I love it when there is angst in a relationship before the characters get their HEA (and I really hope they will get it). Poppy is slowly realizing that she fell in love with Hawke and with Cas, even though she tried to hate him. She is also convinced that he doesn’t really care about her, he just wants her to be in good health so he can use her to get his brother back. So here she is, stuck in this place with the man she loves, and she “knows” he does not love her back, but at the same time he is being sweet and charming and sexy so it hurts her even more because she falls in love a little more every day. Obviously, Cas is in love with her, but she’s oblivious to it, and he is also making a good job of hiding it behind his “Dark One” mask and careless smiles. The last 25% were so full of conflicted feelings and angst and I REALLY like that!"I wasn't rocking that much!" I denied, wiggling to put space between us."I wouldn't advise that,' he said, voice gruff as his arm tightened."Why?""Squirm a few more inches lower, and I'm sure you'll find out."The sexual tension between Poppy and Casteel is *chef’s kiss*. They have 0 skills when it comes to clearly communicate with each other, but when it comes to hot and steamy moments charged with sexual tension, lust, and desire, they are 10/10.Wanting to know how these people knew what Kieran and Casteel were, I twisted at the waist.“You’re naked!”“I am,” Kieran replied.And he was.‎Kieran is one of the best secondary characters ever. His deep bond with Casteel is amazing and his shy and budding friendship with Poppy makes me want to see more of him in the next book (I also have to say that that one scene with Cas, Poppy, and Kieran made me realize that I would not be against some sexy moments between the three of them 🔥🔥🔥). I really love him. Delano is also a secondary character that I grew to love very much. He is less present in the book, but he made me smile too with his little comments about Poppy and Casteel, and he is one of the only Wolven who respected Poppy from the start and gave her a chance instead of immediately disliking her for her association with the Ascended."Please don't fight atop the horse," Delano called out. "None of us wish to watch Setti trample either of you.""Speak for yourself," came Kieran's droll voice.Casteel straightened "Don't worry. Neither of us will fall. It was just a love tap.""That did not look like a love tap," Naill commented."That's because it was a very passionate one," Casteel replied."You're about to get a love tap to your face." "It turns me on when you're armed with something sharp.""There is something entirely wrong with you."He came around to my front. "But you like what's wrong with me."I love their snark and witty banter. Especially now that there is anger and angst mixed into it. The running gag of Poppy being violent and stabbing everyone was also funny and I adored how Kieran mastered the art of being sarcastic while appearing bored and emotionless. His interactions with Poppy always made me smile either because he was so obviously exasperated by her (but still like her way down deep inside), or because he was defending Cas and he was being so loyal to him.The man was suddenly lifted up and tossed aside like he was nothing more than a bag of small rocks. I had no idea where he landed. All I could do was stare at Casteel.He stood above me, his face splattered with dots of red.“You’re bleeding.”“You have three arrows sticking out of you.”“You’ve been injured. Where?” He knelt beside me, ignoring my somewhat unnecessary observation.“I’m fine.” I sat up, my eyes glued the arrow jutting from his stomach as I sheathed my dagger. “Does it hurt?”“What?”“The arrows.” I paused as he grasped my left arm, pushing the cloak aside. “The arrows that are sticking out of your body.”A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire is full of action, violence, betrayal, twists and turns, and horrible truths, but it is also filled with fierce love and friendship, and perfect and delightfully intense sexy moments. This book is a rollercoaster of emotions. I laughed out loud many times, I was at the edge of my seat for most of the book and now that it is over I feel like crying because the final revelation with the cliffhanger ending is KILLING me.“I don’t want to pretend,” I whispered. “I’m Poppy and you’re Casteel, and this is real.” 😭 I love them. 🖤Also, I have to say that I do not trust Alastir, I am sure he was the man talking to Poppy's father the night they were attacked... And even if he's not, I don't trust him and I don't like him. He was also clearly behind the attack at the very end of the book, and he probably also has something to do with the attack that killed Poppy’s parents.
