The Heroes (First law world,#5) by Joe AbercrombieIt's lower quality in my opinion. I feel no real empathy with the characters. Although the book is set over a very short period, it seems to drag to its conclusion. However, the second half of the book was far better than the first. But the book was a disappointment. The truth is like salt. Men want to taste a little, but too much makes everyone sick.Disappointed
