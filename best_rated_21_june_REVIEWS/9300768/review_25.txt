War in all its misery. Did you expect anything else? This book is as Abercrombie as it gets. As The Bloody Nine would say, you have to be realistic about these things.The story takes place a couple of years after the first law trilogy (read it first!) and centers mostly around a three day battle between the Union & the North. There are quite a few of the characters we have come to love present, but sadly, also a few key ones that have gone back to the mud in between books. I mention them only because I was really hoping to read more of them. Abercrombie has a knack for writing characters that you just want to keep on reading about. In some of his other books I have found the plot to sometimes stall a bit, but the strength of the personalities he has captured on the paper always pulls him through and thoroughly makes up for any shortcomings in the story-line. The plot did not need any assistance this time round though.I must mention the excellent sequences where multiple POV characters are used in battle, with a change in the POV triggered by death, and POV changing from the victim to the perpetrator each time. Superb.The only thing I disliked was the death of my fav character in this book. Oh, and also the tying up of the different characters story-lines which seemed slow after the huge final battle. Necessary, but slow.
