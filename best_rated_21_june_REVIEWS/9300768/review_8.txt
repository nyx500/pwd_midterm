A great addition to the First Law universe, but ultimately not as good as the larger scope booksThe Heroes was a very good standalone book that shares many similarities to the First Law Trilogy, but doesn't quite hit the same "highs".The idea of writing a whole book about one battle over the course of three days felt somehow both refreshing and stale. I've never read a fantasy book that has such a limited scope before, which will good also made me hungry for the larger world and the grand scope of things that the First Law Trilogy did so well.Some of the First Law favorites are in this book, such as Bayaz, Black Dow, and Dogman. It features particularly unique and well rounded new characters along with seeing some older characters in greater detail like Bremer dan Gorst. I am looking forward to finishing up these standalones and getting back to Abercrombie's bread-and-butter, which is his series work. Having said that, this really is an enjoyable book for any fan of Joe Abercrombie, and I would not encourage anyone to skip over it.Check out my new youtube channel where I show my instant reactions to reading fantasy books seconds after I finish the book.
