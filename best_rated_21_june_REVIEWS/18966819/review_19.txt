Re-read - somehow even BETTER than I remembered.Holy Moly that was a real ending. I'm pretty gobsmacked. This is an absolutely phenomenal read.Even though I wasn't mad on the beginning, Golden Son really ironed out any issues I had with Red Rising, developed the already great characters and threw in some amazing twists and turns. Not to mention that the ending was incredible, my heart was in my mouth.5 gory damn stars.
