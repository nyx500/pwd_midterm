Epic roller coaster ride from start to finish! I'd have given it 6 stars if I could.At the end of the first book of this trilogy, Darrow Au Andromedus, after winning the Institutes barbaric challenge, kneels before his enemy and agrees to become his adopted son. The second book in the trilogy begins two years later with Darrow at the head of a fleet of warships battling a simulated war against house Bellona's oldest son Karnus for victory in the graduation test of the Academy.I won't spoil even the first chapter for you. But this author knows how to take you from highs to lows to highs to lows and back again. There were times I wanted to scream "Yeah!!!!" and others when I wanted to throw my tablet across the room. I couldn't help but relate with Darrow in the first book and that continued and deepened in the second. The love he has for his friends continues to grow, as he also gains other friends. He feels terrible guilt because he's constantly having to lie to them about who he really is. The guilt eats at him throughout the novel. I thought it made him so real. I think anyone in that situation would feel the same.The writing was amazing. When there was betrayal, it came as a shock. When there was a twist or turn, I was surprised that I didn't see it coming. Which is so refreshing! It seems so many authors think they have to foreshadow things. Prepare our fragile hearts for the shock like we can't take it if they don't. I think there is nothing better than reading something and going "BEEEELP!!!" There was enough of that in this book to make it easily my favorites of all time. Seriously, I think I finally read a book that has dislodged Ender's Game as my favorite book of all time.Grade A, absolutely fantastic material. Definitely a MUST READ!To read my review of the other books in this series, use the links below:      Book One: Red Rising 	 Book Three: Morning Star
