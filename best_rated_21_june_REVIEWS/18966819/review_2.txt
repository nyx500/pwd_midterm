Did I mention that I listened to these almost exclusively as audiobooks?I did. And the narration was, to put it plainly, purely brilliant. Dude knocked it out of the park.In fact, the narrative voice was so strong that when I picked up a paper copy of the book so I could read it faster. (I read about 5 or 6 times faster off the page.) The narrator's voice stuck with me in my head, like when you read some text next to a picture of Morgan Freeman.So yeah. Not just some excellent books. But excellent audio production as well.
