"I would rather be punished for making the right decision than live with the guilt of making the wrong one for the rest of my life."  This was a fun and nice read! I expected some more but at least it did not disappoint me. Sophie is an extremely special human - she can hear other people's thoughts and she has a photographic memory and stuff - then she stumbled upon a boy named, Fitz, who is totally similar to her. Then *poof!* everything started to change in her life. ðŸ˜²It was slow-paced. At first, nothing was happening, just some info dumping here and there. However, when i reached the middle part of the book, things got somewhat exciting. The world building was delicate, nice and vibrant. I loved their magic system and stuff. Though there were times i got confused, but eventually i got the hang of it lol. Characters. Sophie Foster, the "special one". She has powers greater than the others. She's okay, just sometimes whiny and dumb. Fitz. I don't like him. He seems spoiled and irritating. I get why Sophie had a crush on him, but meh. Dex. Well, he is a really good and supportive friend.Keefe. I like and love his character (kinda reminds me of Leo from HoO). Honestly, he's the one who motivated me to turn the page and continue reading. And the side characters are all so far okay.   Across the river, a row of crystal castles glittered in the sunlight in a way that would make Walt Disney want to throw rocks at his "Magic Kingdom."  (ps: i wasn't really planning on writing a review since i read this last Dec but someone insisted so yea, managed to write a quick review) I got hooked on it and i loved the magical stuff. I was on a dilemma for what to rate it, (five or four stars?) but in the end i decided to give it a four. This book was great but still has flaws. Recommend to others!
