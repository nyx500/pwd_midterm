4.5 stars. A wonderful story, full of great characters, mystery, and adventure. I was engaged start to finish, and I appreciated the vivid storytelling. The author didn't pull any punches and it all fit together really well. It wasn't perfect imo — it had at least a couple of plot holes and definitely could have used tighter proofreading — but nothing that kept me from loving it.Note: there's a reason I don't call my m-m shelf "m-m-romance." There's an m-m relationship here but it's not a Romance™, so align expectations accordingly!
