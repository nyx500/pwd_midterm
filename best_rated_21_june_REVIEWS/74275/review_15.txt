A great conclusion to the first two booksâ€™ story arc. Despite the author not pulling her punches in this one, the story is very readable and I really liked the characterizationâ€”Seregilâ€™s and Alecâ€™s, of courseâ€”and the way their relationship progressedâ€”but also Theroâ€™s and Bekaâ€™s.I couldâ€™ve done without the rapey undertone to Alecâ€™s first time, even after thinking about it in relation to the worldbuilding and all, that detail felt gratuitous, it didnâ€™t even add anything to Ylinestraâ€™s characterization.. There were also a couple of plot holes, but they can be easily overlooked, taking into account the whole plot.This isnâ€™t romance, so donâ€™t expect one as you would in a romance series with a fantasy plot, but Alec and Seregilâ€™s relationship is still one of the best things in the series, even with the slowest slow-burn I can remember and the stinginess with graphic details. Not that a lot happens that couldâ€™ve been graphically detailed, but thatâ€™s kind of the point. It goes without saying that the BR made it even better. ðŸ˜Š
