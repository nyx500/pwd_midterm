4.35I loved this so much, I can't! 😭❤️This book was bittersweet as a whole and I loved the hell out of it.Seregil and Alec became two of my favourite characters and one of my ultimate OTPs from mage one of Luck in the Shadows and they deliver every time.The ending was so, so good and it just loved them together.This is the first high fantasy series written by a female author that has worked for me and that I've rated more than 3 stars (😅) and I just can't believe how much I love if.I love the world, the characters (you poor souls 😭😭❤️) and the story, I just love them so much and it's lgbt which is so rare for adult fantasy especially as old as this one which, naturally, makes me love this even more.
