A fun second installment. I don't think this one was as strong for me, but it was still enjoyable.CONTENT WARNING: (a list of topics)  a lot of body horror, torture, loss of a loved one, gruesome death, harm to animals, coercion of will, sexual assault. Things that were great:-The slow burn. It's nice seeing a friendship slowly advance.-The stakes. Way higher! -The drama. Once the drama started, goodness was it dramatic in all the best gothic ways.Things that didn't work as well for me this go around:-The pacing. The first half was veeery slow. I could tolerate it in the first book because it was essentially "magic school," but this was about how bored they were and what whores they wanted to try and people assaulting Alec in a way we're supposed to find funny because...he's a virile young man, I guess?-The gore. Hoo boy. So, I actually like body horror, in that it makes me feel horrified without setting off panic attacks. But wowza this was a lot. I got it after the second or third torture scene, I don't think I needed more reminders.-The plot. It was tenuous enough in the first book. This one more or less was along the lines of "it's destined, so this will all work out." Very gothic, but not the part of gothic romances that I actually like. Speaking of romance...-Romance. Yeah, it's sweet and pretty well done to overcome my fears, but I just don't like 'em lol. Having a romance on the side, sure. Or having a book about falling in love, fine. Having one that keeps cropping up at weird times usually makes me switch gears too fast and I don't get the enjoyment of either the "d'aww" or the heart-pumping danger.Also I think this is a great example of why I don't read series back-to-back. I probably would have rated this higher if I'd given myself a couple of months to be less enthusiastic about the last book. But I didn't, and I won't. Definitely worth continuing the series, but I made my hopes out of wax and flew them too close to the sun.
