*Trigger: There is some female-on-male rape in this book although it's not in explicit detail* This book is the second in the series and picks up not too long after the ending of the first. We see that our characters have grown more since the end of book one and settled into routines and life in Rhimanee, but there's still many mysteries to uncover, both about each other and to do with what they found out in book #1. In this instalment I really did connect more to the character of Seregil and I think, besides Lysander and Micum, he's my favourite in the book. I do really like Alec and there are moments I really love him, but Seregil is just such an interesting character and his thoughts about life and love intrigue me. Seregil also has the added bonus of a very long life to live and so he's been through much and he's still living and experiencing new things too...What I did really like about this one is it felt a little more like a storyline rather than just happenstance. Sometimes in book #1 I felt as if the characters were just trundling along without too much *life-threatening* stuff forcing them into tricky situations. This book had a little more action and there was more to play for which meant it kept me interested and excited throughout. Overall this is a very solid continuation and it again made me want to just keep going with the series (which I have done) so I would highly recommend it. Fantasy with bisexual characters and super fun plot...why, yes please! 4.5*s overall.
