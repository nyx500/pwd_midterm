I've just got to chapter 8 of this book, and I'm furious. Imagine a naive and starstruck 16 year old being drugged and then raped. Not very funny is it? That is of course, unless that 16yo is a boy, and he's being raped by a sexy older women. Then it's hilarious, and geewhiz, isn't he glad he finally got rid of that pesky virginity?? No. Fuck that shit, and fuck this book.
