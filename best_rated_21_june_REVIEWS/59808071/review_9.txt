HAPPY PUBLICATION DAY, BALLAD When I first got the email that my owlcrate edition of this book was going to be delivered 3 days early on September 10th, I thought it was a blessing. Not only was it my day off but this book was my most anticipated read of the year!! Then, at 1 am that next morning, it felt more like a curse. Which is actually the theme here so it kind of makes sense. And now, 3 days later, I’m STILL suffering from such intense heartbreak that I don’t know if I should rate this book 1 star, or 5 stars (I’m rating it 5 of course)⚠️This review will contain MAJOR spoilers so proceed with caution…⚠️This book started right where Once Upon a Broken Heart (which I will be referring to as ouabh from now on) left off. Evangeline is writing a letter to herself, warning her not to trust jacks again. She goes on about even though he’s cute as fck, it doesn’t matter. THEN she writes”Remember that he was the one to poison Apollo so that he could frame you for murder in order to make a long lost prophecy come true-one that would turn you into a key capable of opening the Valory Arch. That is all he wants, to open the Valory Arch.”So basically, I want to talk about this first because I think it’s one of the most important parts of Jacks and Evangeline’s relationship. So since the start, in ouabh and in most of Ballad, Jacks makes it clear that the only reason he keeps saving Evangeline from dying all these different times is because he needs her as the key. He says it, she says it, everyone says it. And it’s like ok, that makes sense. BUT THEN…When Jacks takes Evangeline to the hollow and she has the youth stone and the youth stone also makes people tell the truth. Jacks doesn’t know she has it and he admits that he doesn’t even want to open the Valory arch. HE DOESNT EVEN WANT TO OPEN THE VALORY ARCH!!! All he wants are the four stones needed to open if which he didn’t even need Evangeline to help him find them. Which leads me to my next point. Jacks cursed Apollo. And I know it doesn’t really make sense as to why he would have cursed him if he doesn’t even want to open the arch, but I think he new Apollo is a bad person and will hurt Evangeline. (Because Apollo steals all of her memories at the end of the book and makes her forget everything, I will get to that later). But I don’t really know if that would make sense because the cure for Apollos curse is In the Valory Arch. It’s all so confusing to me and all my emotions are so conflicted but I think it’s very important that Jacks was actually keeping Evangeline alive all those times because he LOVES HER. DUH. ONTO MY FAVORITE EVAJACKS MOMENTS In ouabh we had like minor angst and then the crypt scene phew. But I had to put Ballad down multiple times just to process the tension oh my god. So many butterflies for them 😭 This part of the book was literally life changing for me”Evangeline—“ Jacks’s low voice sounded distant, but he must have been there because she could feel him. She could feel the cool of his arms siding gently under her legs and carefully under her neck as he cradled her to his chest. “It hurts, jacks.”“I know, love. I’m going to take you somewhere safe.”Oh my god, he literally just called her LOVE ??? I literally died and came back to lifeAnd then there’s just the entire part where they’re at the hollow together, I wish I could put that entire section in this review because it’s fucking everything. Also this part. ”I mean… it’s just for one night,” he said softly. “In the morning, you can forget it. You can go back to pretending you don’t like me, and I can pretend that I don’t care. But for tonight, let me pretend you’re mine.”Keep in mind, JACKS said that to Evangeline. 😭😭😭Now…As I drew near the end of the book, I could feel my grip on this happily ever slipping. I will literally start crying as I describe how saddened I was by this ending. After Jacks uses the four stones to go back in time and save Evangeline from chaos, it is then IMPLIED that he sacrifices himself in her place. I feel like this could definitely be and opening for a third book because I just feel like after everything Jacks has been through, and how much is readers love him. He death cannot be so… not there. Also there was never a body soooo….But the very end, like the last chapter and then the EPILOGUE. Ruined me. Literally fuck Apollo, I fucking hate him. Which is another reason I think there could be a third book, because what the fuck??? Since when can Apollo just fucking pull memories out of peoples heads?? There has to be some explaining there. And also if left in such a cliff hanger?? But also part of me thinks, this is just a tragedy, and maybe it is. Because my heart is most definitely broken and maybe it just has to stay that way. I shall finish off my rant here, I should probably talk a little about the story and writing now. As always, I love Stephanie Garbers writing. It is TRULY magical. I devoured this book all in one sitting and it’s a world I most definitely would love to visit. The story itself was nothing too complicated, I loved the story of the archer and the fox and how it ties in. I loved Lucs character. His and Evangeline’s relationship is just proof that exes can have healthy friendships after. Even if one of them is a vampire 😏I will probably come back and edit this review at some point, or maybe not. It’s very ranty but I must go drown my sorrows in a bottle now and make an Evajacks playlist on Spotify that hopefully I can link on here later. ————————————————————————UPDATEI have no idea if this is a duology, I just always assumed so because of the title but it’s probably not ————————————————————————First reviewMorning after reading this and I’m suffering from such intense heartbreak, I can’t focus on anything else. I wish this was just a dream 💔
