Update (9/28/22): Just hopping on here to confirm that there will be a third book in this series! I can't share much more about the book just yet, but I wanted everyone to know that Ballad is not the end of the story. :) Update (12/16/21): This book now has a title and a release date! THE BALLAD OF NEVER AFTER is the title and it will be releasing September 27, 2022. I could not be more excited. And I cannot wait to share more now that the official countdown to the release has begun! I can't wait until I get to say more about this book!
