YOURE TELLING ME I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL OCTOBER FOR THE NEXT BOOK?!?! I might simply pass away from the suspense. Anyway I bow down to this entire series. I'm so obsessed. The absolute PAIN I feel wanting Jacks and Evangeline to get together is excruciating. This book had things that surprised me, magic/fairytale vibes that dazzled me, and such high stakes that I read this book so fast. If the third book doesn't have a happy ending I might just never pick up another book again.
