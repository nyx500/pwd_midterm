Complete and Edited Book Review....down there somewhere***Thoughts before Reading***(Just scroll down little dhampir^^)Okay the last book of the series...Wondering what "Last Sacrifice" means??? My speculations on who kills the Queen, I think it's probably Victor Dashkov since he is free now or maybe one of the royals I bet it's Adrian's father.I'm Team Adrian, but if it's going to be like Twilight, then Rose and Dimitri would be together at the end, I'd just hope something happens like Dimitri die or whatever lol.I think if they find Lissa half-brother/sister, then she'll be the next queen for the Moroi Society.I bet Rose will be a fugitive and Abe's the one would help her.I just wish the ending would not be too much of a happy ending like what happens in Breaking Dawn, when they don't fight in the battle so no one major dies.***Thoughts after Reading This One***Note: First I'd like to say that I'm really confused on how to rate this one thus I have two ratings. If I will base it just on pure emotions alone or how I felt about the book in general I will rate this one star. However, if I put my emotions aside and judge the book rationally I will have given it a five star. But I favor my emotions rather my reasoning so it has a one star rating displayed up there. But just to be cleared I repeat that this is a one and five star book at the same time.And then there will be SPOILERS, Fudge these SPOILERS!Note: Skim this one, this is just a crazy letter, bear in mind that I'm still emotional.Dear Self,I hate you.I really hate you!!!Why, why are you always like this? Why do you always side on the second guy in a love triangle? Is that a sickness of yours or something? First in Twilight you're Team Jacob right? And didn't you ever learn your lesson in that that the second guy will always be fucked up by the heroine in the end. That they will just be trashed and dumped out like stupid piece of shit! But you always team up with them don't you? You still always most often than not love the second guy rather than the main guy right?You pissed me off. Look you already know how it will end (Are you really that dumb?) since this one is what exactly happens in Eclipse too! But what did you do? You still hope and have that wishful thinking that Adrian and Rose will end up together. That Dimka will die. That Rose and Adrian will end up having little dhampir babies and that will be the solution to their dhampir-will-be-extinct problem. But girl you're so wrong don't you? Because Richelle Mead broke your heart into microscopic pieces of myocardial cells! Rose not only break up with Adrian, but she cheated on him. She had sex with Dimka even before breaking up with Adrian! What an irony is it right? You're crying and losing your mind reading a sex scene because of the reason that you felt cheated too!And now you still don't learn do you? You still would have those naive fantasies that Puck and Meghann will end up in Iron King Series, Bianca and Balthazar will be together in Evernight Series and Jem and Tessa in Infernal Devices series. Please it will never ever be a possibility, so I beg you don't fool yourself into thinking about it!Sincerely yours,Evil Alter Ego******************************************************* The Five Stages of Grief as Applied to my DilemmaNote: Please don’t take this seriously.

It’s a good thing you get past that but seriously friend, I think you have another problem, you now have delusions!*************************************************************** Book Review (Finally! I think this should be my longest review ever, why the hell are there so many intros? O_o)Let start with the good stuff...Why-oh-why the 5 star rating?1. The cover’s gorgeous, that’s a plus!2. The title was also good “Last Sacrifice” though I really don’t get what the hell is the so-called “Last Sacrifice” in this book. Please someone explain that to me on the comment section.3. Rose POV is sarcastic, witty and funny as always that it never fails to crack me up.4. Abe Mazur was funny as hell as always.5. Sydney the alchemist was backed.6. We get to go to different places, like the community of the Keepers, Sonya’s crib, etc.7. The Politics! Gosh I love all of that! The election of the new Moroi Queen and Lissa’s tests are really exciting and different as she pass onto another level, like there’s a test for physical, emotional and intellectual. 8. I love the final test; the question was like, “What must a queen possess in order to truly rule her people?” And actually Lissa’s answer to that shocked me and I love it.9. I love Lissa in this book I think she had that sort of character development in this one. I kind of underestimated her because in the previous books I really thought that she was a weak character, but in this one she really did grow and I believe that she’ll be an amazing queen.10. I also love Sonya Karp I think she has all that wonderful quotes in the book and I was really glad that she and Mikhail finally reunite.11. I also love Christian in this one even though I missed his firefighting coolness. All of his scenes were like a good ‘ol boyfriend to Lissa, but at least those happens to be sweet moments in this book that all of a sudden I really wanted to be Lissa.12. I really love the murder mystery aspect of the book, I must admit that tuuuut as the Queen’s murderer was not that really shocking since someone already spoiled it to me in the comment section *coughs* (lol I’m just kidding) but seriously as you go along the book there were clues that actually you really would have guessed that tuuuut was the one who did it.13. Okay let’s talk about Lissa’s sister, that kind of shock me because I really thought that what they will meet was a new character of the story, but it was tuuuuut(OMG) though yeah I was kind of happy about it because I kind of love her from the previous books.14. OMG Tuuuuuut died and tuuuut killed her because she kinda lost herself because of Spirit-induced anger. I think it was quite shocking but I really don’t care about it because I really think that character deserved to die anyway.15. Victor and Robert team up with Rose’s team I think that was also surprising and thrilling at the same time. I also love the part when they fight and like Sonya use Spirit and then Robert uses spirit too and Victor uses earth. It was pretty epic like an anime fight scene.16. Yeah in general I did think that this was an amazing book and an amazing series (just minus the Adrian part). It was fast-paced, full of twist and turns, the characters are all great, it was thrilling and just simply amazing. Why-oh-why the one star rating?1. Rose cheated on Adrian. Really Rose out of all the people! (T_T) you’re unbelievable!( I would like to share some passages from the book, that really made me want to rip the book in half)Page 417: We touched in no other way, but his hand held all the warmth in the world. This was hardly a perfect moment, like in the library, but our familiar connection and the understanding between us burned brighter than ever, and it felt good. Right. Natural. I didn’t want to sleep. I just wanted to stay there and savor being with him. It wasn’t cheating, I decided, thinking of Adrian. It was just enjoying this closeness.***Oh really Rose? Fudge you!***Note: this next scene happen after Dimitri and Rose had sex.Page 488: Regardless, I couldn’t lead him on after sleeping with Dimitri. It hadn’t been murder, no, but it had certainly dishonourable. Yet...I couldn’t say any of that to Adrian now, I realized. I couldn’t break up with him in a dream. That was almost as bad as a text breakup. Besides, I had a feeling that...well, I’d probably need his help. So much for honor. Soon, I swore. Soon I’ll tell him***Rose you’re the worst living creature ever! (T_T) You’re not only a cheater, but a liar and a user as well!***2. Worst break-up in the history of my reading books ever!Page577:”I loved you!” he yelled. He jumped up out of his chair so quickly I never saw it coming. “I loved you, and you destroyed me. You took my heart and ripped it up. You might as well have staked me!” The change in his features also caught me by surprise. His voice filled the room. So much grief, so much anger. So unlike the usual Adrian. He strode toward me, hand clasped over his chest. “I. Loved. You. And you used me the whole time.”***WTF! This kills me! (T_T)***I really hate this! I hate Rose and Dimitri! If I ever saw Dimitri in person I’m going to do thisCalm down, calm down, calm down...Okay so much for drama, I just want to say that I still love the series and I still love Richelle Mead (though you did break my heart) and I’ll still wait for the sequel to come out and for the movie as well.This btw is what I imagine Adrian will be:
