5 I can't believe its over 😭 ★'sWhat a journey this series takes you on. No matter how many time I read these books it will always be one of my top 5 favorite series EVER! I love everything about it, everything! Rose is a kick-ass heroine beginning to end. I may not always agree with everything she does but I never once disliked her and that is rare for me to say. I'm gonna keep the review short and sweet. Read the series. If your sane, you will not be disappointed lol.I'm just going to post a couple of my favorite quotes. Ones that made me happy or broke my heart. “What?" I asked uneasily. "Why are you looking at me like that?"He shook his head, the smile rueful now. "Because sometimes, a person can get so caught up in the details that they miss the whole. It's not just the dress or the hair. It's YOU. You're beautiful. So beautiful, it hurts me.” “She was right about something else too," Dimitri said after a long pause. My back was to him, but there was a strange quality to his voice that made me turn around."What's that?" I asked."That I do still love you."With that one sentence, everything in the universe changed.”“I don’t belong to anyone. I make my own choices." "And you’re with Adrian," said Dimitri."But I was meant for you.” Poor poor Adrian. This one broke my 💔“I loved you!" he yelled. He jumped up out of his chair so quickly I never saw it coming. "I loved you, and you destroyed me. You took my heart and ripped it up.” All that matters is Rose and Dimitri get there HEA♥Lissa and Christian get there HEA♥And If you wanna see Adrian get his HEA♥ I guess you'd better start reading Bloodlines Series 😉.
