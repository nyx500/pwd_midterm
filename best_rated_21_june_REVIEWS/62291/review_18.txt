This is an extraordinary bloodbath of a book, George R R Martin showed no mercy when it came to these characters or our feelings. In one afternoon of reading I witnessed 4 main characters (5 if you include Grey Wind!)  and countless side and minor characters die - ruthless! Other than the severe heartache and trauma brought on by the Red Wedding and the Battle at Castle Black this book was a delight to re - read. I loved being back with some of my favourite characters and being back in this world. The action, drama and political intrigue are really kicked up a notch (admittedly sometimes too much for me to handle!) and I canâ€™t wait to pick up the next one to finally be reunited with the wonderful Arianne!Also, I know I complain about the TV show every time I read a ASOIAF book but seriously, wtf were they thinking not doing these books justice?
