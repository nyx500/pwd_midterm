This is going to be a short one. I am too disappointed to be able to write much. I am not disappointed with the book but with myself for failing to love this one. I have no idea what went wrong. I love satire and the subject seemed to be something I would be interested to explore. I liked it, I got some of the hidden meaning but overall I was not enthralled. I tried both the audiobook narrated by one of my favourites, Julian Rhind-Tutt and the written Romanian version. None of the two versions left a lasting imprint in my soul. I could admire the craftmanship and the importance of the novel but I could not get immersed in the story. The plot felt too convoluted , there were too many characters, too much chaos, I got tired. I plan to re-read it at some point in the future because I believe the novel deserves a 2nd chance.
