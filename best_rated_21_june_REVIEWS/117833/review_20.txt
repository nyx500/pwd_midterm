This book is my all-time favourite. I have recently listened to The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov on Audible narrated by Julian Rhind-Tutt New English translation by Michael Karpelson, the most exciting listening. Also, I have read it in its original language, Russian, respectfully, which was quite a challenge despite me having had Russian language lessons in high school. I have read it in Lithuanian to understand better it. This classic is phenomenal, a gift from Russian society geniuses. Every time I read or listened to this book, it was hilarious, exciting and intenseâ€”how the author shows politics and delicately touches inside problems in Russia. The plots with the devil and Jeshua are priceless.
