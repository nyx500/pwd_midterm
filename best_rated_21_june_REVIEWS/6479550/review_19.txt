This review can now be found on Rosaline's Rolls & Scrolls.Actual rating: 4.5 StarsAmount of enjoyment:   Okay, okay, okay! So much to cover! Brace yourselves for extreme amount of happiness and cheer!I loved so much stuff in this book I don't know where to begin. I have been praising Kate Daniels so much I sound like a broken record. So I'm gonna stop, and just show you.First of all, we have Curren prowling around and flexing his gracious ass for everyone and being all  Who then tries to keep his majestic alphaness around Kate, but instead going Here, kitty kitty kitty!Then there's my bae Kate going all badass on damn knights, clan alphas, and very very dangerous Certain People. And of course, His Royal Meow! Then arrives a very dangerous Certain People whom I will not elaborate on cause you just gotta read the book! We have lots of nice fighting, Glued asses, Scaring off of half-gods by means of growling and being unreasonable, And of course, some Beastelicious times!(I just realized how wrong this sounded! Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope....)Honestly, it was about time, Kate! We were all dying over here from you two's constant sizzling!Anyways, I have nothing more to say! Time is precious and I gotta go read the fifth book book!One more thing, this entire time I was imagining Kate in her own room and now I find out she's been sleeping in the living room all these books? Now my whole mental image is destroyed! Why me?BLOG | GOODREADS | INSTAGRAM| TWITTER
