Sixth re-read: 17.01.22This one is a good addition to the series as well. I love Curran, Kate is great, Derek is awesome. I skimmed a lot as I remember it all. Enough said. Fifth re-read: 17.07.19Curran is one of my favorite male characters and Kate is one of my favorite female characters. Together, they are one of my favorite couples. They are strong, supportive, protective and loves each other very much. It's beautiful to see them become closer. After reading this book so many times, I remember pretty much everything, so I ended up skimming a lot (I've done this with all the re-reads of this series I've done these couple of days), but it's still damn enjoyable and I really love the main characters.New Rating: 3.5 stars.Fourth re-read: 27.04.17This will be my last re-read for now. I won't go on with the series; I just wanted a bit of Curran. Sometimes I get that need. Luckily, it got fill after re-reading #1-4 :)Third re-read: 18.09.16One of the downsides with this book is how little Curran is in it. Other than that, it's pretty good, as always. There is no doubt that I'll be re-reading it yet again.Second re-read: 07.08.15Still awesome. And still wish for more Curran.Re-read: 29.07.14I love this series. So much that there was no surprise that I re-read it :PFirst read review:Ilona Andrews is becoming one of my favorite authors! :D I love her, and she's a fantastic writer! :) Magic Bleeds was as awesome as all the other books in the series. I love Kate & Curran, and I can't wait to continue reading their story! :D
