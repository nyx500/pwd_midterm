Let's take a moment to review the things I love in this life. *My husband and kids *Diet Coke *French Fries*And an awesome little book, called Magic Bleeds. I really didn't think the Kate Daniels series could actually get any better after Magic Strikes. But as good as that one was, this one was better.As the book begins, Kate is preparing for that naked dinner she promised Curran. But he doesn't show. She calls The Keep and gets the brush off. And hours later, she decides she's been played for a fool. A few weeks later, she is back at work and determined to forget her feelings for the Beast Lord. She gets pulled into a case, where a mysterious being is bringing a plague to Atlanta. Throughout the course of the investigation, Kate has to use her contacts with the mercenary guild, Saiman, and even the shapeshifters. Which throws her plan to avoid Curran out of the window.It's clear these two are crazy about each other, but there's a lot working against them... The worst offenders are their responsibilities and stubbornness. But it is so gratifying to watch them work it out. Their relationship is so great, because they can retain their individual strengths, while allowing the other in. During their courtship, we learn a lot about Curran's background and pack politics. Not only that, we see what it will mean if Kate needs to carve herself a place in his life.While Kate's personal life heats up, her investigation into the Plaguemaker takes a more personal turn. As so many things in her life do, it ends up with a major connection to Roland. And it forces her to share some of her most closely kept secrets.AND THERE IS FINALLY SOME SEX. I can't say enough about how good this book was. Not only does it put most other series to shame... It puts the first two books in this series to shame as well. All hail Kate Daniels. 5 stars.
