[June 2016] ❣ KD is the Cure to All of Life's Problems Buddy Read (KDitCtAoLPBR™) with my dear wife Ange, and the poor IAA souls who have fallen into our deathly KD Surprise Reread Trap (KSRT™).· Original rating: 5 stars· Rating after xxxxxx rereads: 100,000³ stars. More or less. Kate Daniels is IT. Kate Daniels cannot be rated.» And the moral of this particular rererereread is: I want Ilona Andrews and Glen Cook to team up and write a series/book/cereal box blurb/whatever/anything with Kate Daniels and Lady as main characters. Now that would be intergalactically EPIC. And epically INTERGALACTIC. I'd read the story and never recover. Well maybe I would. If I rererererereread it over and over and over and over again. Forever after. And stuff. It would be glorious.➽ Ilona, Gordon, Glen:The End until next time[Original review]☆☆☆ Post-Shift Productions proudly present ☆☆☆Yet Another Exciting Day in the Life of Kate Daniels►8.00 a.m.: investigate the death of a human barnacle.
