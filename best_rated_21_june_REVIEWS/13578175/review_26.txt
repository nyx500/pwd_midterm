Rating this book would be difficult, especially because it's a short novel so I'll go through some points:Characterization – the book is focused on two main characters, and that's probably what made it possible to portray them so well. The characterization in this book is superb, sanderson even managed to develop these two characters throughout the book in a very believable way, and considering the length of the book he did an excellent job.Just don't look for humor, as there's no funny character here, unlike other books by Sanderson. There're a lot of witty dialogues though :)Definitely 5 stars here.Magic system – This book has a unique and very imaginative magic system. For the matter of fact, throughout the first half of the book there're a lot of explanations of how forgery works and there're also some explanations about its mechanics in the second half. Forgery is relatively a complex magic system (it's more complicated than Allomancy or Feruchemy for instance), and it would have benefited being included in a longer novel, as Brandon could have developed it more than what could be done in 170 pages.4.5 stars (It's a 5 stars magic system, and any other author would get the fully 5 stars here for being imaginative, but considering what Brandon could have done with this magic system in a longer book I reduced half a star).Plot – it's a short novel and it includes a relatively complex magic system, so the plot that can be squeezed in a 170 pages is quite limited, though the storyline here is good. Most of the book occurs in one room so don't expect for too much action.The story has a fully closed ending (unlike Legion), and it's a very good one.4-4.25 stars here.The Verdict – This story is more about characterization than anything else, and it's very well written. It's so clear that it's a Sanderson book, I'd have easily figured it up if I didn't know who wrote this book.All in all, it's a very good short novel. Highly recommended to any Sanderson fan.4.25/5
