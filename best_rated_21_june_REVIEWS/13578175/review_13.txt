In The Emperor’s Soul, Sanderson proves that he doesn’t need 1000+ pages to write a stunning, emotionally compelling story. He creates an intricate, beautiful magic system called Forging, or the art of making imitations, convincing objects to take on the traits of things they are not. Shai is a Forger tasked with copying the emperor’s soul. But a soul is more detailed, more layered than any oil painting or ceramic vase. Along the way, Sanderson raises philosophical questions that show surprising depth for a novella of 100 pages: What about a person determines who they are? Can a copy be considered a work of art in its own right? The twists are carefully plotted and perfectly paced, and the ending resonated deeply with me. Sanderson’s ability to create vivid characters with complex motivations and dynamics really shines in this novella. The Emperor’s Soul is exquisite.5 stars
