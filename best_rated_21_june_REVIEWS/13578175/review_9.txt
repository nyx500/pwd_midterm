4.5Absolutely brilliant and very compelling!! How can a favorite author become even more favorite? I knew this novella will be good just not that good. Iâ€™m pretty sure now once I read Stormlight (hopefully this summer) Brandon Sanderson will become *the* favorite author.This is without a doubt the best short story I've read in my life. Sanderson proves he's yet again a master at characterization and through this book, we get a glimpse of how he also thinks when writing his characters. It's also a standalone and romance free which was nice. Although part of the Cosmere, it can be easily read if you're new to this world too since it's not related to any of his other books.I've read a few novellas by Brandon Sanderson and it's nice to see how he's evolved in writing those too. I might raise my rating to 5 stars later.. the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars although objectively it deserves it, is that I'm in a not a book slump (I'm reading just fine) but I'm finding it difficult to love books like I used to.
