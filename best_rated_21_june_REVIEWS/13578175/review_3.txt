Well, that was a little unexpected!I was planning to keep my novella ratings between 1-3 stars, but Emperor's Soul had me so confused I had to make an exception. At around 100 pages long, this certainly is no major entry but I was having a heard time understanding why Sanderson would come up with a novella this long while having almost no connections to Elantris. Yes, there were a couple of minor connections here and there but they were so well hidden that one has to be very attentive if they you don't want to miss them! For the entirety of the book I was thinking this must have been started as a second book and the author decided to limit things to novella.Even if you are a reader who skip novella's usually, I strongly recommend that you don't skip this one.
