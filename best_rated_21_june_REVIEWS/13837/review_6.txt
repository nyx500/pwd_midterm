A great wrap up to the series! I have always enjoyed the twists in this book and how all the character arcs wrap up. I had forgotten about her affair with a significant older man in this book. Alanna is 20 when they meet and he's 34, which some people may not be a fan of. I thought it was handled okay and I like how sex positive this book is, especially given when it was published. One interesting thing I learned from the Afterword is that the war zone Alanna visits in this book was inspired by Tammie and her friends experience with the Vietnam war and was intended to show how awful the aftermath of war can be, how much it affects women and children. This is definitely among my favorite books in the series and I had a great time revisiting it!
