I feel like this book was a great way to end off the Song of The Lioness quartet! Sure, the pacing was rushed, and it wasn’t always thoroughly developed, but I don’t care. This was simple, and I’d rather a book be fast paced than drag on. And, although a ton of other reviewers complain about Alanna’s several relationships, I love that we’re given a character who doesn’t meet her fairytale prince on the first try. The love square doesn’t bog down the plot at all, it just shows Alanna’s growth as a character. I loved that she made the best decision for herself, and realized that what she wanted wasn’t to be a queen, it was to travel, to adventure. Although this definitely isn’t the highlight of fantasy, and doesn’t compare to some of the others I’ve read, it remains a favorite!
