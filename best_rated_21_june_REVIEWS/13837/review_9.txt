I should have stopped reading this series after the first book. And I'd like to dock half a star on this for the needless murder of a cat.SIGH.Maybe high fantasy isn't really my thing. Maybe I needed this magic system more fully explained than it was. Maybe I needed something more in-depth than a middle-grade series could provide. I'm not sure where this series went wrong.(And speaking of middle grade, Alanna sure gets laid a lot for a middle-grade series. I'm just throwing that out there. And don't try to tell me that this book isn't middle grade, because it's not written above maybe a fifth grade level.)I just couldn't get behind this. SPOILERS There was just no doubt that things would happen the way they did. Of course Alanna would be able to pass as a boy with no problems. Of course she'd become Jon's squire. Of course she'll pass her trial and become a knight. Of course they'll defeat the whatever it was in the first book. OF COURSE Jon isn't offended that she's been masquerading as a boy and basically abusing his trust. Of course Roger is evil, of course he isn't dead, of course he still has magic. Nothing is a surprise or suspenseful and everything turns out exactly the way you assume it will.It's just boring. I think if it weren't middle grade, there could have been a lot more to it, a lot more development, that would have made it a much better series.
