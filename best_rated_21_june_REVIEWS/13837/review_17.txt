Five stars, for this, surely I must be kidding? That, or delusional.It was worth every single second to read. I can usually tell how much time passes while I read, not here, not with this volume. I was sucked into it with glee(a pinch of foreboding too).The first half of LR finds our Alanna and Coram continuing the plotline from the end of "The Woman Who Rides Like A Man". They are off to decipher the package Alois(the doomed sorceress) had given over. Things progress quickly from here a series of meetings, attempted assassinations and of course a meeting with our lovely, somewhat helpful and terrifyingly vociferous Goddess.More Tortall lore gets expounded upon(which is great). More romance ensues(which is...well I guess a girl has got to have a life). More characters are introduced(also great). Then, when all that is done, about halfway through at the end of more great fighting, the "Silent War"(my own name for it) recommences. The Silent War(the one between George and Claw) has been bloody and gets bloodier. The war splinters into the overarching plot around here and things begin to come to light. I won't spoil anything, just to say "If you thought the first half of the book was gripping, you poor soul, what will you do now."The rest of the book tells all and spares none. The end, while not what I would call unique was not one that you could guess with even 50% accuracy(I am talking about the whole sequence here not the overall outcome).Now that all my praise is out of the way, here is my one gripe with LR. Alanna cried a lot, I mean abundantly. I don't know if a chapter passed(with her in it) where she did not cry/shed a tear, once. I found it ridiculous. That out of the way, I am sad that this saga is finished. One loss in particular was hard to take but I think predestined(not the one that was obviously predestined, that was obvious as daylight and quietly done). I'll revisit Tortall sometime soon and see what more she has to tell. "So mote it be."
