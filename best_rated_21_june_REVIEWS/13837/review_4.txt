I'm just posting this to say that I was thoroughly impressed by Tamora Pierce's fight scenes. Like it's obvious that she thought about how Alanna could win fights against people who are physically stronger without any magic short cuts. Most of the time when I read action scenes in books I have no idea what the fuck happened or the author takes a cop out and writes something like "and then everything happened at once" and then skips to the aftermath but in these I always had a vivid mental pic of everything that went down and it was rad. The last few action sequences were especially amazing and I wasn't expecting that.I kind of wish that the last two books of this series had been cut down into one, because I feel like there was a lot of filler that I could've done without.
