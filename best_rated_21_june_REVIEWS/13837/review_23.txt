A strong closing for this young adult fantasy series, which is quite enjoyable even if it's not in the top tier. This final chapter ties everything up neatly, with some good drama â€“ although you kind of just have to accept that a major plot point has happened, even though it makes no sense whatsoever. The characters are strong and relatable, and Alanna is a terrific role model, Pierce mainly avoiding the traps into which too many YA writers let their female leads fall, either letting romance dominate the story or managing to reinforce gender stereotypes by insisting that she "isn't like other girls." Alanna ends up struggling to balance the requirements of her position with the call of her heart, but in a way that is true to her character and the world Pierce has created.If anything negative can be said about the series overall (aside from the book-specific critiques one could make), it's that this series has aged a little; the YA genre has matured to the point where this series can sometimes feel a little quaint, closer to middle grade in tone and subject matter. That might explain why it's not as frequently cited among the best YA fantasy series, although it should be.I'm really glad I discovered this one, and hope more people do. Although more and more authors are writing strong girls as the leads of fantasy series (Katherine Arden and Leigh Bardugo spring immediately to mind), there are few enough that a trip back to the 1980s to meet Alanna of Trebond is well worth your while.
