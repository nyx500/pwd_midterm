I, too, have a cemetery of forgotten books. A mental one, if you will.And I am filing this one under "to forget" straightaway.This book has been on my to-read list for what feels like 11 years, but was probably between 2 and 4. It seems like required reading for anyone who a) likes books, b) likes genre-bending blends of literature and fantasy, or c) enjoys fun books but is also pretentious.I'm all three, so this seemed dreamy.And then I found a copy of it in a used bookstore and the cat lady cashier recommended it as I was buying it (which is always a good sign), and it seemed dreamiER.And then I started reading it, and for the first 15% it still seemed dreamy.And then it took me almost two weeks to finish it because I dreaded even picking it up.Everything about this fell apart for me. The pacing, the characters, my interest, the treatment and discussion of women, the themes, the setting. I didn't care about anything I was supposed to and sometimes I was even growing AGGRAVATED.I hate to be aggravated.I am glad this book is a ~modern classic~ and so many people's all time favorite and blah blah blah but honestly...I don't even understand how people like this book.And that almost never happens to me.Bottom line: Sorry, everyone! Except really I feel like you should apologize to me.--------------pre-review...except this one, for me.review to come / 2ish stars--------------tbr reviewbooks about books are the best kind of books
