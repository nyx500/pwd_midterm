this is one of those rare times where i am at a loss for words. i don't know how to describe what i went through while reading this book, i don't know how to express my love for all of these beautiful characters and i don't know how to say anything else then AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa in regards to that heart crushing ending.i think it's official to say that i now feel very differently about cassandra clare's books than i did a few months ago.i just.......... don't know how to put my feelings into words. if you want to take a look inside my current state of mind: §"%§%"(/=§)$=§?$?$??$)/=§$(IUED§HUOGKWUDZ there you go. that's my brain.there's one thing i want to say though, and this is coming from a self-proclaimed (former) hater of cassandra clare: her books are so full of positive representation of all kind and i'm so, so happy about that. so much diversity in a fantasy series. i am in awe.//might add a few words once my brain has regained it's normal functionality[4.5 stars]
