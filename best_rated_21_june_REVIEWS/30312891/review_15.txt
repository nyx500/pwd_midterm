I HATE EVERYTHING!!!What? How? What? WHY?!This book was absolutely phenomenal......Until the last two chapters. Now, I’m an emotional mess. Absolutely distraught. How could this happen?!!! I’m actually crying right now. I hate everyone who told me to read this. Jemma is one of my all time favourite ships. Kitty has definitely grown on me. I can’t believe that I actually enjoy the “hot faerie threesome” now? I stand by the opinion that Jem-Will-Tessa would’ve been a threesome if Cassie had written the Infernal Devices today. I feel GIPPED! Also, Gwyn and Diana are absolutely adorable. BUT MY HEART!!!Poor Julian. Poor Emma. Poor Mark. Poor Ty. Poor Drusilla. Poor Tavvy. Poor Christina. Poor Magnus. Poor Alec. Poor Isabelle. Poor Simon. Poor Max. Poor Rafe. Poor Maryse. Poor Clary. Poor Jace. POOR EVERYONE!ZARA AND HORACE CAN BURN IN THE FIERY DEPTHS OF HELL!!!Needless to say, I’ll be picking up Queen of Air and Darkness ASAP!
