My reaction after finishing Lady Midnight My reaction after finishing Lord of ShadowsI've had it with love triangles! I'm usually up for them as long as my ship prevails in the end ;) but man did Cassie complicate things for every possible pairing in this book. Emma/Julian/Mark - I thought this triangle wasn't so bad after I was done with Lady Midnight cause I knew Emma and Julian couldn't be romantically involved but Cassie effed things up with E&J always finding ways to hold each other and kiss. It was like saying you hate your ex and then getting back together the next day. Kieran/Mark/Christina/Diego - this triangle was the weirdest of them all cause I had a feeling like they wouldn't mind a 3way (minus Diego who's cancelled)Livvy/Kit/Ty - erm... Is Cassie setting up Kit and Ty for a parabatai bond? Or are they going to date? I'm still not sure. I'm very much looking forward to witnessing the parabatai ceremony since I have no idea how that actually happens. Note: I've only read the first 4 TMI books, not the full series. I actually found out in LoS Clary and Simon are parabatai. Now I'm like 0_o TID>TMI Triangle drama overshadowed everything else and I ended up disappointed cause Clare went for cheap tricks and chaos. Tsk, tsk! And to think this book is over 700 pages long.
