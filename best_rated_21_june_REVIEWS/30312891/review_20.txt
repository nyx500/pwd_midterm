5 stars*UPDATE 6/18/17 - NEW added song suggestions at the bottom of review>>>>>>>I have no words right now ... I am in shockCurrently questioning my life and what to do with it for the next two years while I wait for Book 3?Also can someone come pick up the broken pieces of my soul for me? Thanks*Major Cliffhanger warning!* Quite possibly the worse cliffhanger I have ever read. Clare ends this book at the height of major action without having resolved any of the storyline yet ... and now I have to wait till 2019 for the conclusion. I'm a little irked by this actually!Nevertheless ... I'll add this book to the list of books that now own my soul.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Pre-readThe following is a chronicle of events that place as soon as that package hits my front door:Fangirl HARD✓ Hug package✓Open package✓Fangirl SO HARD✓Hug book✓Sniff book✓Remove book cover to check for hidden imprint?✓ (No imprint but there is a poster runes under the cover!)Dance around the house✓Cry uncontrollably ✓Set up elaborate Instagram photo-shoot with book -LATERhug and Sniff book again ✓Post Instagram photo -LATERFangirl SO FUCKING HARD! ✓Lock myself in a corner and watch my emotions get destroyed -✓Question my life and what I will do until book 3 is released - CURRENT SITUATION________________MUSIC SUGGESTIONSMUSIC SUGGESTIONS *Warming ... added feels possible*Eyes Half Closed by Crywolf aka Julian's heartbreak songWhisper by CrywolfAngels by CrywolfFortress by IlleniumCoattalis by BroodsRush Over Me by Seven LionsAnachronism by Crywolf
