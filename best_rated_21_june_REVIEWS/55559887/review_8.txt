NAOMI NOVIK I HATE YOU SO MUCH OH MY GODTHAT ENDING I JUSTI CAN'T __Okay, I've given it a week, and feeling a bit calmer now. Let's try and review this thing.TLG picks up exactly where ADE leaves off, with El having received a mysterious note from her mum telling her to beware of Orion Lake. To be fair, there's not really much need to 'beware' of him for the first 30% of the book, because he features surprisingly little. Genuinely barely appears in the first three chapters or so.But when he does, GOD. It's so good. Everything my little literary-romantic heart could desire. El and Orion are absolutely one of the best, most fulfilling YA romances I've ever read.The plot is everything, too. It's wicked, clever, and very fast-paced, involving plans to escape the Scholomance which just keep getting higher and higher in terms of stakes. There were times when I worried the book wasn't long enough for the amount of plot packed into it, and I was partially right: Novik has compensated by hitting us with an absolutely evil cliff-hanger. I haven't been affected so badly by a cliffhanger since November 2018, when I read The Wicked King. That's how jaw-dropping it is. Book Three simply cannot come fast enough.
