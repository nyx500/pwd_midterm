annnnd my most anticipated release of 2021 has become my most disappointing read of 2020. the prison healer did not feel like lynette noni at all. and the romance 100% felt like sjm. - protagonist goes on about how much she hates the love interest and will never date him all the while simping for him- no time to develop plot or characters before protagonist goes straight into “ugh he’s so HOT but i HATE him”- protagonist assuming everyone wants to date her- love interest saying “it sucks that someone touched you without your consent so i’ll cheer you up by touching you without your consent” .... seriously .... why would you think that’s a good idea?? and why are readers supposed to think this presumptuous and disgusting behavior is hot??- seriously. don’t climb into someone’s bed after they just got assaulted. WHY ARE WE ROMANTICIZING THIS. - getting assaulted doesn’t matter if a cute guy assaults you afterwards!- having ptsd is a choice apparently- “i don’t expect anything from you” he says while expecting her to date him. why are they such hypocrites - if someone abuses you while they’re not sober it doesn’t count- also a plot twist that undoes pretty much everything the protagonist has said, so once again, why would i trust her?? it literally means she was lying in her OWN thoughts for the entire book like?? it does not add up. this is the opposite of what i love about lynette’s writing and i’m so sad she went in the typical romanticizing creepy guys and a complete lack of consent direction instead of the amazing and expansive series where characters were more than their dating lives. and they weren’t all liars and hypocrites and i could actually care about them. i think i’m just going to forget about this series and not let it taint the medoran chronicles for me. that series gave me so much hope that i finally found an author that wrote wholesome and non-problematic books but ... it looks like a certain author ruined that for her. her characters went from sweet and funny to gross and boring and i just ,,, why 🥺. do we really need to rely on nonconsensual relationships and justifying abuse to get readers now?a note that desperately needs to be made about this shitshow: ptsd is not a choice. you’re allowed to hate your abuser. and you shouldn’t touch people just because you think they like you. cw: mentions of rape (ongoing theme), mass cremation, graphic depictions of cremation, self harm, torture, torture/abuse being justified by MC, and MC saying that mental illness is a choice
