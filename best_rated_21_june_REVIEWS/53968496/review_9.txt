I loved this book! I formed immediate attachments to so many characters! The story felt well plotted and I loved the setting. And the twists!!!! They kept coming!!! Very well done, especially that last one. The characters are well developed, Tipp had me sobbing!!! I would literally jump in front of a bullet for that kid!Jaren is so endearing! How do you not like him? He’s immediately one if my favorite book dudes. So sweet!Naari is badass and I love her. And if course the main character Kiva, she is super interesting but so many questions! Starting next book in 3…2…1…
