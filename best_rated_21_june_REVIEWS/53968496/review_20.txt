Actual Rating: 4.5✶Well... damn. I really, really liked this book. I was completely invested the whole way through and had the joy of predicting things left and right, but not in a way that felt like the book was overly predictable because that wasn't it. It was more the satisfied kind of "I knew it" whenever something was revealed. And now I feel so stupid after that ending because what the actual hell was that and how did I not see that coming?I need... something like... idk, 5-7 business days to process what I just read? The next book immediately? Chocolate and popcorn? All the above. This book was good. It reminded me of everything I love about YA fantasy, which I needed right now as I've felt really meh about a lot of my reads lately. Nothing has wowed me or left me feeling completely gripped by the story in a long while, not the way this did. I will say, if the long list of TW didn't give it away, there's a lot of heavy content in this book. The book takes place in a prison and as such, it's not an uplifting books by any means so I wouldn't exactly recommend it to more sensitive readers. But I loved this and I need book 2. Like yesterday.
