Gross. I would strongly discourage my daughters from reading this because it encourages a certain kind of female I can't stand: the girl who doesn't get along with other girls (to whom I always want to say "The other girls don't hate you because you're 'special', they hate you because you're insufferable.") The tolerable, even interesting Menolly from the first book (which I gave 4 stars, by the way) disappears into a freaking Mary-Sue, oh so talented, yet so modest, championed by the "good" guys but loathed by the "bad" guys. Blanket dismissals of the other girls abound, and the only ones she gets along with are the ones who are useful to her, either through being in charge of the "women's" work, or in helping her take down her female rivals. Not even these allies are spared: when she finally claims one of the girls her age as "one of her best friends", Menolly finds her tedious because she isn't as good a musician as Menolly. From being persecuted and determined in the first book, she just becomes spoiled and annoying in this one. Making journeyman as quickly as she does also defies belief, as does her multitude of skills mastered by the age of 15.
