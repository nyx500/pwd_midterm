This is the second book in the Harper Hall Trilogy and it follows Menolly as she comes to the Harper Hall to become and apprentice.I absolutely love this character. She has been through so much with a father who would hold her back from music because she is a girl. She is so talented in music and as a song writer that it is such a shame. They did whatever they could to hamper her dream of music. Then, the Masterharper of Pern finds her after looking for the one that has written the songs that are so loved. She is taken as Masterharper Robinton's apprentice. As she comes to the Harper Hall, she is not accepted well by the other girls. She is more talented than them, she outranks them and she has nine fire lizards. So they are cruel as girls will be. Menolly takes everything in stride even though she is modest and often times questions when good things happen to her. The harpers all see how talented she is. This book takes you on her first week in the harper hall with all her troubles and new friendships and how she grows. Soon, she realizes she does belong and in the end is made a Journeyman. It is a well deserved honor.These are such fantastic books and Menolly is such a great character.
