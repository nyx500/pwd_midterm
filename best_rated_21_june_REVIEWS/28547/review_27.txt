The first two books in the Harper Hall trilogy focus on Menolly, a young woman with a very difficult childhood, who has impressed nine fire lizards and has become a favored apprentice of Harper Hall. The story is very much character-focused, so not as much happens, instead focusing on Menolly's adapting to an environment very different to what's she's ever known and the relationships she builds. It is, however, interesting to see how major events that occurred in the original Dragonriders trilogy impact others in this world. Masterharper Robinton is my favorite character from the original trilogy, so I'm happy to read more about his Harper Hall and the people around him.
