As a teenager in the 80s I read this many, many times. The Harper trilogy books belonged to my favourite books in that decade, together with The White Dragon. Menolly has always been my favourite character, besides Robinton.This book picks up right after Dragonsong and I recommend reading them back to back. Menolly arrives at the Harper Hall and learns what it means to be a harper. She makes friends and enemies and finds her place in the world of Pern.
