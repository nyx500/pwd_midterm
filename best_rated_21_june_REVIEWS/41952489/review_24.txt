This book was awesome - intense, inventive and action-packed from beginning to end. It included a ton of things that I like in a story, and then executed that story really, really well. Where the blurb mentions Game of Thrones, I’d liken it more to something like Red Rising, with its protagonist driven by revenge, class system to overcome, and story that moves forward with a kind of forceful, gripping, action-oriented pace. In fact, I think that fans of Pierce Brown’s series (as I am) would almost certainly find something to love here. But The Rage of Dragons is very much its own thing, too. The magic system is clearly defined, used inventively, and allows room for some interesting development in the future. The world itself is distinctive and well-realised, and yet it’s clear that this book only scrapes the surface of a larger conflict, too. There’s definitely plenty of territory for the sequels to expand into.Finally, for those who want to know about mature content – swearing is a non-issue, the violence is brutal but not gratuitous in any way, and there’s one brief sex scene. It's somewhere between Brandon Sanderson’s books and Game of Thrones, but much closer to the former. There’s certainly nothing that would make me hesitate to widely recommend it.So all up, a very enthusiastic ‘go and read it’ from me!
