An amazing first entry into a fantasy series with an extremely unique settingCheck out my new youtube channel where I show my instant reactions to reading fantasy books seconds after I finish the book.This book really does live up to the massive amount of hype that surrounds it. The plot is compelling, the fight scenes are intense and gritty, and you really feel the emotional connection to each of these characters.I love the worldbuilding that has been done here. It does a lot of things that I absolutely adore in my fantasy novels. I love it when a fantasy setting is unique, and the African inspired book is something I have never read in a fantasy novel before. I love when a world is much larger than the plot of the book, when you have entire continents that are important to the plot but never seen by a POV character. I love books that have the main character far exceeding the artificial limits that have been placed upon them by the rules of their world. And for some reason I love fantasy books that have a "school" setting or a "tournament" setting.I do think that the plot is too narrow however, and I was desperate for it to be a bit more complex. This book is still a 5/5 stars for me, but I wouldn't put it in the elite category of 5/5s that I have read. I also thought the characters were a bit one-dimensional. This may be solved in future books, but in this one they didn't have a lot of complexity.I eagerly look forward to reading book #2 in this series.
