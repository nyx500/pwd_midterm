First Read: July 2020, Rating: 5/5 starsSecond Read: January 2021, Rating: 5/5 starsThis is the first instalment in The Burning series.The synopsis describes this book as "Game of Thrones meets Gladiator" and there could be no more apt comparison. The Omehi people have been involved in generations of conflict. A few of their women are born with with the power to take energy from the afterlife and send those in their paths to the demons who dwell there. More of their men are born physically bigger, taller, and stronger. However, most of their people are doomed to the life of an average lower-class being - spending their days preparing for battle and their nights plagued by nightmares of the bitter end they are sure to meet there.This book was battle-heavy, action-focused, and blood-drenched. The entire almost 600-pages were focused on the intricacies of war politics and training to become another body for the battlefield. This isn't my usual preferential focus inside the fantasy genre, and yet I couldn't tear myself away from these relentlessly-paced scenes.The magic system was structured quite differently from any other I have read, and I appreciated how unique this addition was to the novel. The magic worked seamlessly alongside both the physical and political conflicts to ensure this remained as intriguing as it was engaging.Protagonist Tao had much learning to do over the course of the novel, and I enjoyed journeying with him on this course of self-progression. Despite his initial setbacks, he remained a character I could care for. His weaknesses ensured him an authentic individual and I nearly gave myself whiplash for how many times I flinched when he threw himself headfirst into danger, time and time again.This is the first book in what I am positive will be an entire five-star series and I am just as sure Evan Winter is an author I will read anything and everything from, in the future.
