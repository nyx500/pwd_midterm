New book this year!! Update: 13 Nov 2013, uh, what?! It's not going to be released Dec 3rd? So I've been lied to for months now?!!! Someone's gonna have to die for this treachery!Update: 6 Jan 2014...... WOOHOO. Official release date May 27th. Update & review: 1 Jun 2014.Well, well, well. What a game. Mab, you wicked faerie. This book was very good, plenty of action, development for the series, and for Harry in particular. It made it me cry at least twice, maybe three times. Hard to do.My only complaint; I wish we could've seen Thomas (& McCoy). Five stars.
