Also reveiwed for Addicted2HeroinesWow. Book 15, already?Huh. Well I guess since I've been reading these books for years now, that sort of makes sense.So.How did Skin Game hold up to scrutiny?It was classic Dresden. And you can take that whichever way you want.If you're a die-hard fan of this series, and you still enjoy Butcher's books about the wacky (but lovable) wizard, who can't help getting himself in over his head...then you'll love this one.However, if you were hoping for something different this time around?Nope. What it was is what it still is.Skin Game is the same high-octane novel that I've come to expect from this author, and from this series. And, just like all the other novels, the action never lets up enough for you to catch your breath.Also, if you were hoping there was some resolution to Harry's multiple problems?Psssht. Forget it!Looks like book 16 will hit the stores sometime in 2015, but I'm not counting on that one laying anything to rest, either.If you've ever read a book from the Dresden Files, then you know there's not really a way to coherently explain everything that goes on in the story.Too much! Too much!However, I can say that it involves robbing Hades of the Holy Grail, a parasite that may explode from Harry's head, a hilarious sex scene with Murphy, Butters and Bob's skull on a magically powered skateboard, Michael with the power of an archangel, an Honest-To-God lightsaber, and Santa Clause vetting for a mercenary.And really, that just scratches the surface...Sound like your cuppa tea?If so, then I suggest you go grab a copy.However, be warned that this is not a series that you can plunk down in the middle of, and hope to catch up. If you're serious about starting this one, you've got a whole lotta reading to catch up on!
