Hey, I have a new booktube (youtube for book reviews) channel and mentioned the Dresden Files in my Top 10 Spooky Reads Not Stephen King here. I hope you enjoy! Please subscribe if you do, thanks!I don't even know what to say at this point, but this was even better than the last. Which is pretty much what I've said for the last 8 books or so (though I did struggle a bit with Ghost Story). Harry went from fun, pop, episodic books and easily forgettable, to an ongoing epic that keeps building and building and getting better and better. I can't recommend this enough.I was glued to this audiobook pretty much from the first moment and I don't even have to say how good Marsters is. He's just so good.Bring on the Peace Talks!5 out of 5 Stars (Oh so highly recommended)
