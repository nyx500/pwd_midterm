*4.5 stars*Though this wasn't my favorite Harry Dresden book, it was still amazing. Part of that is because the audio of this book is so good I could cry. The audio of this series, especially the later books, is simply the gold standard of what an audiobook can be. The audio for this book was astonishingly good, and I think even if the book was terrible, I could never do anything but love it. The story was exciting, Harry was impressive, and the audio was divine. Now I just have to suffer and wait for the next book to come out.
