But above all, I just want this book to come out! (or at least have any spoilers - I mean, I'm dying here!)---------------------------------------------------------That last book left me in a jumble of emotions and feels and thoughts. But I realized something worse. Since the House of Hades is the second to last book in the series, I predict there will be a big cliffhanger!You think this is bad?Just wait till we read this book! ... Yes, I acknowledge the fact that we have to wait to read this book for practically a year.But on a different and much happier note: The title of the book is House of Hades Could this mean ... NICO!!!!I think I would cry and hyperventilate if it's Nico's perspective! My heart wouldn't be able to take it. My undying love fascination of his character is just so deep, and I swear, I just want him to get out of that damned jar. Screw Team Percy or Team Jason, I'm Team Nico DiAngelo!I wanna date meet the Ghost King!Speaking of which, Nico better be okay and he better stay alive and Rick Riordan, don't you dare lay a finger on Nico! If you do, I swear, you better sleep with one eye open.Percabeth update: Rick has confirmed that Annabeth and Percy are alive. How they're doing though? No clue. But I expect a lot of romance cause what better place to spend time with your boyfriend than in hell ;) Direct quote from Rick: "The one thing I can promise regarding “The House of Hades” ***SPOILER ALERT**** At the end of “Mark of Athena”, Nico senses that Percy and Annabeth are still alive, despite the incredible danger they are in. Nico is right. They are alive. You WILL find out what is happening to them in the next book. They don’t disappear from the story. **** END SPOILER ALERT*****"I'm honestly not sure if I want Percy and Annabeth's perspectives to be told. If I had to choose, I would want Nico (obviously), Leo (he's hilarious), Reyna (we have to know what's going on in the Roman side of things) and .... Maybe Jason? We haven't heard from him in a while and he is a main character. As much as I love Percy, I'm not sure if Rick will include his perspective again. I'd rather Percy's perspective be in the last book than in the second-to-last. Or maybe that's just me.On the romance department, I've lost so much respect for Jason. Playing both girls .. not cool. I don't know if I want him with Reyna anymore, I'm so conflicted.And the whole Leo/Hazel/Frank thing? UNDECIDED!There's so much romantic drama in these books now! ENOUGH WITH THE LOVE TRIANGLES!My most important request? I miss some of the old characters Rick. Whatever happened to Grover or Thalia or even Percy's mom? Bring them back ... please?Post some spoilers Rick!!!! Please, please, please, please! Or else (and I'm serious this time!)Cause a year is just too long to go without PercyEDIT! - November 13thSorry to say this edit doesn't have any spoilers or upcoming information and things like that. But I have a real important thing to say ...Please do NOT rate the book alreadyI know, you love Riordan. I know, all the other books were amazing! And I know this book will probably be no different but please save your 5-stars until the book has been released! There shouldn't be any ratings yet, pre-reviews are fine but ratings? Nah.Thanks :)EDIT! - April 5thTwo important things I have to share with you today:Number 1) The cover art will be released on May 31st, 2013So that means that this:While very pretty, is not the actual cover art but a fan-made cover. Why must you taunt me with this???So excited to see it!Numero 2) THE RELEASE DATE FOR THIS BOOK IS OCTOBER 8TH, 2013!!!!Aww, the wait is so, very long. 6 months more ...EDIT! - April 11thWAIT - WHAT? So Rick, you mean to tell me that the fact that Aphrodite talked to Reyna, the fact that Jason felt wrong about Piper, the fact that Reyna was waiting for Jason to come back because she wants to be loved means absolutely nothing?You see, I wouldn't have had such a large problem with Jason and Piper if not for the inclusion of Reyna/Jason feels. If Riordan wanted to be Team Piper, why did he have to make us fall in love with the idea of Reyna and Jason? This is just cruel.On a happier note ...Could this mean ... DOES NICO HAVE A POV????EDIT! - May 31stIT HAS A COVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Let's analyse shall we?So we can clearly see Annabeth and Percy on the cover - the first cover which features PERCABETH *cue fangirl screaming*Secondly, and I'm sure this has already been pointed out, why are those Doors of Death closed? They - they, can't be stuck in Tartaus!!! NoooooO!
