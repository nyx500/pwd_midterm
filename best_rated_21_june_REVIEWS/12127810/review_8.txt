Loved it!Such a WILD ride!we're at the peak of adrenaline!lots of tears & stars!another favourite in HoO series! (it's truly a hard choice between this one & the Mark of Athena, maybe both in the first place?)& we have all 7 half-bloods' POVs! I was just sooooo thrilled the moment I noticed this!I love all this exciting electrifying(!) thrillers which made me agitate even in umpteenth(?) read! also totally strongly-biased about this book.I always read first 8 chapters in one shot, immediately after finishing MoA. AlWaYs!how thrills & dangers wrapped around 'the Seven', especially the moment they think they are safe. well, Mhahaha, you can't run from the destiny. (or more specifically, from uncle Rick.)the challenges, the decisions, their strength & bravery. along with caring & friendships & bondingseverything was happening fast. & EvErY chapter had something important to show!my favourite kind of book!some events were cruel, thus thrilling, more LOVE IT! (*my maniac inner villain cheers*)I cried a lot.All those thrilling & lovable PERCABETH moments!*more cry*✦ “Annabeth's voice caught on the word friend. Percy was a lot more than that. Even boyfriend really didn't cover it. They'd been through so much together, at this point Percy was part of her--a sometimes annoying part, sure, but definitely a part she could not live without.”✦ “Annabeth?” Percy said again. “You’re planning something. You’ve got that 'I’m-planning-something' look.”“I don’t have an 'I’m-planning-something' look.”“Yeah, you totally do. Your eyebrows knit together and your lips press together and—”✦ “He gave her that smirk she’d come to love.”still (in re-reading) had to subdue my willing to skip some chapters to reach Percabeth! I didn't because all chapters parallel, connected & of course, interesting!& I actually smiled like an idiot when I read "he had Apollo's smile" for no reason. (well, yeah there is a reason; which is I love Apollo, but he was not there, you know? as if I smiled only because I saw his name.)& fun spiced up almost every moments! (I mean some of those on the-edge-of-the-seat moments have disguised momentarily joke (like the Venice adventure) or someone (mostly Percy or Leo) to add funny comments, to reduce the tension or to boast or any other reasons.ladies & gentleman; Percy Jackson!"Keep climbing,' he told himself.'Cheeseburgers,' his stomach replied.'Shut up,' he thought.'With fries,' his stomach complained."& Annabeth...Annabeth, the precious gem of all heroines. She is awesome, wise, calculating, smart, quick thinker (the Night part was so funny!), strategist, planner, brave, badass, caring, knowing she's not flawless, but never giving up, [not whiny, not annoying or a hot-head] & everything I need to love a heroine exists in her.& Bob n Bob.& Jason (am I the only one who loves him? I think I am the only one who loves him from his first appearance in the Lost hero); he's a natural leader (like Percy) & brave & strong & of course, adorable, caring, in general, my sweetheart.& Nico, our small precious bean! so brave, so good.& sweet Frank, bad boy Leo, charming Piper, strong Reyna Practical coach Hedge, all are very interesting & lovable characters. I love them all! (well, not Octavian!) but at the top: Percy & Annabeth, Jason & Nico.I love how their relationships/friendship developed, they all care about each other.
