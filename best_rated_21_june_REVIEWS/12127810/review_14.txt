“You cannot control your parentage, but you can choose your legacy”As always, Rick Riordan doesn't disappoint. Action, fun, more action, gods and monsters, legends and heroes, love, revenge and friendship. That is basically The House of Hades.All in all this was great. Sometimes I got a bit weary, the page count is quite big in this one. But then with such a big cast of characters, it's no surprise. It's actually really quite impressive how Riordan manages to give everybody a fair share of the spotlight. No one is left behind. Even the character developement is on point.My most beloved character however is Nico di Angelo. I'm totally rooting for this guy and can't wait to read more of him. He deserves to be lucky...and I deserve to see him with a love interest that I can swoon over.Find more of my books on Instagram
