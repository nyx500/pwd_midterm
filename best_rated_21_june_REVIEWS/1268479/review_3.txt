Son of a damn ass cracker!!! Whyyyyyyyyyyy! I’ve had this mass market FOREVER! I have the Audible. It’s been on my TBR since 2015. What the literal hell! I could have bought the damn ass special edition if I would have read it and realized I would love it!! Because I’m a twat!!! Gahhh! I could scream. I mean I generally love all Brandon fantasy books. I’m a twat! Okay, rant over 😂🤣I loved this book!! I love the characters! I love how unique and different it is, to me anyway. And all the colors!!! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
