What can I say? I really, really enjoyed this. Brandon Sanderson proves once again that he is the master of world-building. It is no easy task to create a whole world complete with a well-developed magic system, different cultures, opposing religions and political intrigue – not to mention brilliant three-dimensional, complex characters to boot!Yet again Sanderson has created realistic characters that almost burst from the page. Told from four different perspectives, you really feel immersed in the story and each character’s thought process. You understand the motives behind their actions yet also see the bigger picture. This allows you to care for them, to worry about their plans and cheer them on. The writing doesn’t feel rushed nor is the world-building too descriptive or slow, and the ending is satisfying yet simultaneously leaves the characters open for a sequel.In romana gasiti impresia mea aici:https://vipera2015.wordpress.com/2018...
