❥ 5 / 5 stars Reading this trilogy is the best decision I’ve ever made so far this year. ♡︎ I love it. I love this trilogy so much I couldn’t put into words. It gave me tears sometimes, yes, but it also brought me so much joy. I don’t even know if I’ll be able to move on from this exceptional and amazing world since I feel like I’m completely bound to it and every single character in it already.
