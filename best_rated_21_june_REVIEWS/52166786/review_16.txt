This book was like those songs that start slow, almost soundless, but that just go up and up until you cannot not hear them. This series made me realize that love is powerful, it can get you through a lot and make you stronger. But it's not everything. Friendship and family are always there when love is challenged. I thought i couldn't read more about Nahri and Dara being apart, but the fact that I enjoyed, that I loved them being in love but apart, just reminds me that you can do everything you want, that you can be a Nahri in a world of Manizehs. “I would do it again, Dara. I would take your hand a thousand times over.”Their love is platonic and so powerful and I couldn't be happier for this finale.Final vote: 4,5ebook provided by Edelweiss
