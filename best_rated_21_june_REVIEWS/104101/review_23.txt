Hmm, a tough book to rate. On one hand, the writing is exceptional. This is definitely a literary novel. On the other hand it vacillates between interesting and been there done that to the nth degree. An epic tale of two roguish men w/ integrity and honor who respect each other, are the bestest fighters and generals for their "at war" tribes. Brutality, war, injustice, trauma, politics, blah blah blah, the love of a good woman. Intermixed w/ a variety of characters that have one special gift. The extraordinary blind surgeon, the son who can predict the location of his parents when they are not with him (that by the way is the closest thing to fantasy that this book has for its stated genre. That and the blind surgeon who performed brain surgery...seriously), the stealthy king who seems to be able to be invisible etc. All in all, an interesting novel that I confess, I wasn't really in the mood for. Given that, it did keep my attention to the end.Almost 3.5 StarsListened to the audio book. The narrator Euan Morton was excellent.
