This was my first Guy Gavriel Kay book and it will certainly not be my last. In fact, I have the urge to read everything this man has written because The Lions of Al-Rassan completely blew me away. The scale and scope of the story, the well-developed characters, the thematic depth, and the gripping tension all brought together by Kay's wonderful prose resulted in one of the most satisfying experiences I've had with a standalone fantasy novel in a long time. From the first sentence to the last, I was utterly and completely engaged and never wanted this book to end. The Lions of Al-Rassan was a compelling and exciting read and I genuinely can not wait to read more of GGK's work.
