Check out my video on 7 Plot Holes in Skyward: https://youtu.be/IGsYseEyWv4Spensa has grown up an outcast but has always dreamed of becoming a pilot her entire life. Will she be able to achieve her dreams? One day she stumbles upon an ancient ship that crashed into her planet. Can she repair the ship before it's discovered? The ship also seems to have a personality. Will Spensa be able to convince the ship to join her side?This book was quite lengthy, and it seemed to drag in certain portions of the book; there was a little too much "Yay! Flying! Let's fly here and fly there. Hands in a circle. Yay!" This isn't the worst book that I have ever read but it also isn't the best. Full disclosure: This is my first Brandon Sanderson book. However, reading this book, I just don't understand all of the fuss. The foreshadowing was a bit heavy handed. A few topics were mentioned over and over, and magically they happened later in the book to the surprise of no one. Also, I would love to know how many times the word, "Scud!" appears throughout the book. In terms of the fantasy, this book aligned more with my tastes. I have an extremely difficult time visualizing what the author is describing so I tend to lean more realistic fantasy or I need a few pictures/video. In my copy of the book, there were a handful of pictures which were really helpful. Therefore, I didn't have a hard time with the fantasy in this book. Overall, this book was ok but didn't live up to the hype of the famous Brandon Sanderson. My curiosity isn't peaked enough to continue this series, but I would be open to reading other Brandon Sanderson books.
