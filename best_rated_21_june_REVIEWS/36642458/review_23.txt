This book took me forever to get through not because I actively disliked it, but because it failed to motivate me to keep reading. The characters all felt rather flat and for as long as the book was, I still didn’t feel that connections between characters were fleshed out. I found myself not caring. In typical Sanderson fashion, the ending was engaging, but not enough to raise the star rating significantly. The ending did hint that the future novels in the series may be more exciting, so I’d be willing to give later installments a go.
