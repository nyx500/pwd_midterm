Finished this last night and I felt kind of unsure about it. I really enjoyed the whole series and I couldn't put the books down until I finished so the story telling was really good. Like I said through out I didn't really like any of the parts that were in second person POV and it felt less strong to have that in there, I think it only detracted from the books. Otherwise though I really enjoyed the books, though I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. I really liked the world building and the character development. I think the characters were all complex and multifaceted which is always a plus. I just think I always end up not enjoying endings regardless of whether or not theyre well written or built up to well. I think I only like endings that are sad and painful and this wasn't really like that. I wouldn't say it was even a bad ending per se. I don't think I liked this as much as the second book either and it did feel weaker than it. I think maybe it's something about series that I just like the books in the middle way better usually and the books at the end just feeling lacking in some way comparatively. The series was enjoyable though, would definitely recommend it.
