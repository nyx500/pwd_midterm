*Spoilers*You know there's something wrong when a major character dies yet it leaves you unmoved. Having cruised through the preceding serials, I was underwhelmed by this conclusion. Not helping was the Info-dumping, likewise the glaring plot hole of the Onyx and Garnet Obelisk (read book one again to sess the inconsistency). Additionally, the author's attempts at bringing some social issues to the fore was heavy handed, which is a shame really since the reader already caught on to these nuances right from the start of the series. Overall, I didn't dislike how the story ended, I just didn't love it as much as the first two.
