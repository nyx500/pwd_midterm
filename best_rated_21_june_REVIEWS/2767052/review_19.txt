personal anecdote - the first time i heard of this book was when i was 17. i was at work (i was a hostess at a restaurant in a mall) and my manager came up to me, gave me $20 and asked me to run to B&N to buy her a copy before they closed. she wanted me to do it because she said it 'would look better if a teenager bought it.'i havent really thought about that day since but, since my time on goodreads, i cant believe how much shaming i see for adults who read books that are targeted for YA or children. what a shame it is that adults feel embarrassed to buy a book simply because its promoted as a story for teenagers!as i reread this, 10 years later, i am even more convinced that people should read whatever they want to read and not feel bad for enjoying what they enjoy! also, gale totally deserves better. i thought it then and i still think it now. my boy is the true hero of this story. and that has been your PSA for the day!â†  5 stars
