I've been waiting months for this sequel, and at some point, my son and I both synced October 2, 2018, on our calendars, as "D day". I. Kid. You. Not.So, it was no surprise to ANYONE ( except for hubby who actually thought we could have a meaningful conversation today *snorts*) that I've been glued to this mesmerizing and brilliantly crafted book, which appears to be even more perfect than its predecessor. Mind effing blown!
