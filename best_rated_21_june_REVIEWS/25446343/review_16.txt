This was glorious. It's been 5 years without a new Laini Taylor book!_____A glorious fantasy, full of pain, heartbreak, redemption and love. Possibly slightly undermined by a too neat ending? I haven't quite decided yet.This is how you write a sequel - you introduce a set of new intriguing characters with an expansive history of their own, and link their journey with the story of Weep, and make the whole thing 10 times fuller and more brutal.Frankly, I hadn't been super excited to go back to the conflict at the end of Strange the Dreamer. Lazlo/Minya standoff felt more or less of a forgone conclusion to me. But then Laini opened Muse of Nightmares on a new world, with two wonderful sisters who love each other and want to escape their small lives, and I was hooked and didn't want to go back to Weep. Things unfolded in Weep (and above it) slowly and not nearly as excitingly as in Nova and Kora's world. That is until the two worlds came together and exploded into so much drama, I could barely take it.I don't think you'll be disappointed in this sequel. You'll finally find answers to all the burning questions. You'll learn to love characters you hated before and you'll hate some that you thought you loved. And then there is Laini's absolutely gorgeous writing...An absolute delight to experience.
