‘once upon a time there was a silence that dreamed of becoming a song, and then i found you, and now everything is music.’i am so enchanted with this story, which lives and breathes magic. ‘muse of nightmares’ is the inspiration for dreams and the home of beauty. it is the sequel i have been desperately waiting for. my love for ‘strange the dreamer’ came entirely from lazlo. he was such a delight. a reader, a dreamer, a man after my own heart. i loved following him on his journey and seeing his progression into becoming the man he wanted to be. so i was beyond excited to be reunited with him again and see how his story continued. and even though i got that, it wasnt to the extent i was hoping for. i wouldnt exactly say lazlo took a backseat in this, but there was a lot more to this book that took some of the attention away from him. where ‘strange the dreamer’ was primarily character driven, ‘muse of nightmares’ was all about the world building and storytelling. new characters and events were introduced, which played a pivotal role in how and why the world of weep is the way it is. i enjoyed how many of the questions i had from the first book were answered, and in a way that was mesmerising. the writing quality of this story is unparalleled. open to any page and you will be immediately transported into a world of wonder and awe. and because of that, reading this was such a captivating experience, right until the very last word.and i feel quite content with the ending. i thought everything was wrapped up nicely, but also gave some room for an additional book. which i hope if the case, because i will always need lazlo, my dreamer, in my life. <3↠ 4 stars
