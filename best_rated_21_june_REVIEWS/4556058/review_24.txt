literary masterpiece👌i really want to take it down but my wild 2017 not-a-review is still valid tbh-----REASONS WHY PERCY JACKSON IS THE ANSWER TO ALL YOUR PROBLEMS (or a reading slump): ● It’s the perfect blend of puns and humour. ● Despite the overwhelming situations and terrifying plot, it never fails in what intended to deliver: a lighthearted read with loveable characters.● ANNABETH FREAKING CHASE● There are satyrs, centaurs, demigods, root beer, deaths and pizzas.● The chapter titles are the best things you’ve ever read (I Buy Some New Friends; I Sit On The Hot Seat; My Parents Go Commando)● So. Much. Drama. ● There’s betrayal, there are prophecies, and there are sword fights. And then, there’s underwater kissing.● Mighty age old gods reduced to a variety of food (I counted there wasn’t a single like Demeter said that didn’t involve the words cereal, or wheat.)�� GODLY AMOUNTS OF AWESOME.● Thalia Grace.● Thought provoking quotes slipped in the narrative: “With great power... comes great need to take a nap. Wake me up later.”● Nico Di Angelo, the precious snowflake I will protect forever.● The promise that everything will be okay.GODS OF OLYMPUS, I NEEDED THAT. I KNEW SOME RICK WOULD CHEER ME UP. I am forever trash for this series. Honestly, reading this makes me feel like it's 2011 all over again. Now that's a nice thought.
