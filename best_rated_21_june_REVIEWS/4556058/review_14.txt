First rating: 4 starsAfter re-read: 5 starsABSOLUTELY AMAZING! UNPUTDOWNABLE. (I got slightly carried away with the caps on but I mean every word).I recommend re-reading this series at least once in a year cause wow I enjoyed it. The Last Olympian immediately grips the reader and there's never a dull moment. Not even Morpheus's magic will put you to sleep. Percy Jackson is the perfect hero. No other words just PERFECT. If anyone wants to fight me on that, go to Tartarus. :)) The Percabeth moments in this one are just perfect. Emphasis on the unforgettable underwater kiss. We all need a Percy in our lives let's just admit it. The fact they both gave up immortality for each other just gives me butterflies. Also, turns out there's a lot of foreshadowing in this one and it absolutely took me by surprise. "Family Luke, you promised!" That made me tear up (among many other moments). Luke is such a well written villian/hero. Kudos to Rick. There are so many great quotes in this one I wish I could list them all here but that would be too lengthy of a review lol. Honestly, I would read a spin off series based on the characters of Clarisse, Beckendorf, Ethan Nakamura, Silena even the Stoll brothers; basically more Camp Half Blood. Well, Rachel has given a new prophecy and am so looking forward to re-reading it and getting lost in the world of the Lost Hero.
