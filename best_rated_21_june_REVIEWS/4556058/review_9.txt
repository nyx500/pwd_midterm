i am so so so pleased with the conclusion of this series and i am surprisingly happy with how much i have really come to enjoy reading this books. the first couple of books were okay but, as the characters started to grow and the plot became more developed and complex, i really had fun with this. this last installment is so action packed - there are no fillers, no down time - its the epic finale that this story (and percy) deserves. i also appreciate how everything ties together nicely. things from the beginning of the story are brought back into play and it comes full circle at the end. again, the strength of these books, especially this last one, is the way riordan makes greek myths so quirky and relatable. the ancient gods are so human, its hilarious. i feel like every greek hero, god, and myth were talked about at least once. such an educational and approachable series i wish i had as a kid!â†  4 stars
