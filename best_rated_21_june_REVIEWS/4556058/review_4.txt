I'm a little sad actually because I didn't want to say goodbye to our hero, the one and only Percy Jackson. From the beginning we can already see things are going to move quickly. Kronos has a lot of things up his sleeve and won't let Percy and the other demigods have a break. The book pretty much starts off with a bang and doesn't slow down from there. Annabeth and Percy's relationship is kind of strained and Rachel showing up isn't helping matters. I have to say all the books have a lot of action, but this one takes the prize. They have to make a movie of this one, it would be insanely cool. We finally get to see how the prophecy plays out, Luke's past, and many other secrets that come to light.One of things I always appreciated about the series is that we see things from all angles. We can get why some of the demigods would side with Kronos and how nobody is free from blame. Everybody and I mean  everybody and their brother  comes back in this book. It was fun to see some old faces and some unexpected heroes emerge. I can't pick a favorite book of the series but if forced to give an answer this one would be it. Filled with action, tough choices, betrayals, and heart, you can't beat that.The book ends with a new prophecy for the The Lost Hero. I can't see how any series could top this one, but I will be reading it of course. Towards the last part I seriously was getting kind of misty-eyed to see it all end but it was so good. So good.
