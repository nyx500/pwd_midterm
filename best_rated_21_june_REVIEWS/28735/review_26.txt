And I say it again: I love this series. This time with Kerowyn, who is brave, strongwilled and has her own set of rules to live by. She is very honorable, but her honor is not the same as the honor of the heralds of Valdemar. Most of the story is not set in Valdemar and that gives a nice glimps of the lands outside of Valdemar and how they see Valdemar. On to the next book!
