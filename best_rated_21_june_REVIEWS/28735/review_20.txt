This is the first time I've read a Valdemar book, and it was a fairly easy read. It traces the arc of Kerowyn's life - she starts off managing the house as her brother has his wedding feast. When her family is attacked by bandits at the feast, she sets off on a rescue mission. On the way, she goes to her grandmother for help and discovers that there's a wider world out there. (This is all at the start of the book - the rest is her growing to experience the world.)I like Mercedes Lackey's writing in general, and this was in line with her usual style. Kerowyn is the prototypical strong independent woman, and while there are romantic dalliances, Kerowyn doesn't let that distract her. I liked that her perspective also touched on strategy as well as the logistics and nitty-gritty of mercenaries or hunting. We don't really find out about other characters or their motivations (for instance, Shallan is a loyal friend, but we don't get many scenes between Kero and Shallan). This is a book focused solidly on the main character and her arc.
