Well that was some damn good storytelling! Karo is a principled, lovable badass. Relatable, too: Though she initially feels monstrous for not wanting marriage and children, she eventually concludes that she can only be herself. That alone was wonderful to read. But her conclusion is also what leads to possibly my favorite romance content of all time. The friendships are glorious, too, starting with a sometimes-hilarious period of training with Daren (under two ass-kicking grandmothers). It’s actually really interesting to see how she learns to collaborate, to work with those she dislikes, to think strategically and tactically... Her growth is convincing, her later adventures harrowing. I made terrible decisions because I could not stop reading. And then .. then we meet characters that I know and love from other books in this world, and that’s great good fun….all leading up to a heart-pounding ending that I couldn’t have loved more.
