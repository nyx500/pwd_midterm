Like most of Lackey's Valdemar novels, By the Sword draws rather heavily on traditional high fantasy tropes in order to advance its plot. Main character who is a fish out of water? Check. Murdered family? Check. Mysterious, ancient mentor? Check. Mercenary companies with uncommon morals? Check. Unlikely love interest? Check. I can't hold this against the book though since the use of traditional fantasy plot devices is one thing I love about this author's work. Kerowyn as a main character is solid and well fleshed out. Most of the side characters do not receive the same treatment, but that is the way Lackey rolls. Since side character successfully fulfill their roles, and rarely feel shoehorned in, I do not mind this. My only real complaint is that the second half of the book feels rather thin. There is plenty that happens in it, and plenty *good* that happens in it, but it almost feels as if all of Lackey's details were spent early on. The ending is something that most readers of the Valdemar books will probably see coming. In the end though, the closing events feel rushed. It was almost as if Lackey knew we were expecting certain events to occur, and thus she wrote them in to fulfill readers' expectations as opposed to writing them in because she truly believed in the final events. The end leaves me wanting to find out more. Were this part of a trilogy or even a two book set that would have been acceptable. When this is a stand alone novel though, it is terribly frustrating. By the Sword is by no means a bad book, and it certainly serves to effectively tie a number of past story threads together. I just wish that some of the events mentioned on the back of this book (in its summery) were more central to the overall story, instead of occasional side events whose importance/significance to the plot is only briefly touched on.
