I love Mercedes Lackey. She has been writing of strong female characters in Fantasy settings for years. Her women are warriors, mages, queens and more. She includes the realities of being a woman in a tough world. She also includes nods to LGBTQ characters in her stories, as well as women who do not want families, or want families and a career. She is one of a few female writers who broke through the stigma of writing in a genre that did not welcome women at the time. This novel takes place in the world of Valedmar. I read it as a standalone book with no problems. She fills in the knowledge gaps with quick references making it unnecessary to read the other books in the series. (I will be going back to the other books since I loved this one.) The world is also well fleshed out in this book as well. I recommend it to all level of readers who enjoy the fantasy genre. It is highly recommended to those who are looking for strong female leads who do not conform to the traditional roles.
