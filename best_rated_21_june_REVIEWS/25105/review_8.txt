Another great and solid volume in the The Sandman collection!Brief Lives is a tale of Dream and Delirium setting out to find their brother, Destruction.The Endless, which consist of Destiny, Dream, Delirium, Desire, Death, Destruction and Despair are more powerful then Gods. They still have family issues, misunderstandings and seem to get into each others way.Destruction has been gone for many years now and Delirium wants to find him. Talk him into coming back to the family and finds a way to talk Dream into going on the mission with her.Her conversations and interactions are so strange and confusing, but this makes sense because she's Delirium.This volume shows how Morpheus is changing in subtle ways. He's regarding and changing decisions that he has made in the past. He's also interacting differently with his dysfunctional family, The Endless.Looking forward to continuing this series!It's been entertaining and great throughout each volume so far. It's very unique and different, just like Neil Gaiman's brain! :D
