Coming off the least interesting volume in the series (The Sandman Vol. 6 Fables and Reflections), Brief Lives was a welcome high point. Delerium wants to look for Destruction, who left the Endless family and disappeared 300 years prior. Dream is the only sibling who agrees to accompany her; he doesn't want to find Destruction, but he does want to take his mind off a love affair that just ended.Delerium was what made Brief Lives. She is absolutely charming and hilarious, and the interactions between her and Dream are just perfection. I loved how the issue titles reflected her spacey, meandering style of speaking. I loved the conversations that she and Dream and Destruction had. I don't normally give out 5 stars to just anything, but this volume had me giddy. I thought The Sandman Vol. 5 A Game of You was deep, thought-provoking, charming storytelling, but Brief Lives just leaves it in the dust.
