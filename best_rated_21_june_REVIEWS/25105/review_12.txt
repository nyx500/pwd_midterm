“You lived what anybody gets, Bernie. You got a lifetime. No more. No less”--Death This is a wonderful volume in the series, movingly told by Gaiman and wonderfully illustrated by Jill Thompson and with consistently amazing covers by Dave McKean (every issue, volume after volume) about a road trip/quest take by Morpheus/Dream and his sister Delirium (who used to be called Delight in happier times) because Delirium wants to find their brother Destruction. Dream has broken up with a lover and hopes to see her on their world travels. Despair and Desire refuse to join them, but that’s okay, because the relationship that we get to see is so great, maybe only exceeded by Dream’s relationship with his sister Death.The thrust of this volume is about family and sibling dynamics as we for the first time in a volume meet all the Endless family, but it is also about “brief lives” and mortality and the limitations The Endless face in their encounters with humans. The inevitability of change. There are tensions within and between the sibs; for instance, why is Death typically more emotionally positive than Dream? Why is Delirium no longer Delight-ed? Destruction, we learn, cares very much for Creation, and so on. There are highlights: The meeting with Destruction. The character of Delirium. One interlude takes place in a strip club called Suffragette City, with Isis dancing. The conclusion of the Orpheus arc happens in this issue and is pretty powerful. I just think it’s brilliant, but you have to read the whole thing, you can’t just pick this one up to get the grand scope and at the same time close intimacy of this volume.
