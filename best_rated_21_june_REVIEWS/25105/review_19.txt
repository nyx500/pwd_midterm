This series just keeps getting better and better. It feels even more immersive now that they released the first season of the TV series on Netflix so when I read I imagine those characters and it makes it even more wonderful!I'm so happy we get to know the other Endless more, especially in this book. Can't wait to see what adventures they get themselves into.
