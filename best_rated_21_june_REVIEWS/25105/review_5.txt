This volume is one tale, one quest. Delirium (one of the less frequently seen of the Endless Family) misses her brother Destruction intensely and is determined to find him. Desire and Despair refuse to join her, but she does persuade Dream. Their quest takes them from a travel office in Dublin, Ireland to a strip club called Suffragette City, from the Palace of Bast, Queen and Goddess of Cats to the Temple of Orpheus (where the head of the bard still lives), and finally toward the island retreat of the abdicated Lord of Destruction himself. Early in their journey—as Dream himself notices—the bodies begin to pile up. Could it be that there is someone (or something) that is trying to keep them from seeing their brother again?I liked a lot of things about this story—Pharamond, god turned travel agent, and Isis’ dance at Suffragette City are two which come immediately to mind—but the most delightful thing about Brief Lives was the character of Delirium (formerly known “as Delight”. For someone whose conversation is full of , and whose appearance changes markedly from panel to panel, she is a thoroughly consistent and charming character, vulnerable, affectionate toward family and filled with a childish delight for experience and adventure. The conclusion of the tale, involving a reunion with Destruction and the fulfillment of a promise Dream once made to Orpheus, is both poignant and satisfying.There is also a good essay by Peter Straub, sensibly placed at the end in order to avoid spoilers.
