I smiled at him. How could he not like it? Passion. Duels. Miracles. Giants. True love.I am assuming you have seen this movie. If you somehow haven’t yet, stop reading this review right now, go watch the movie (I’ll lend you my copy) and then come back. Seriously. I’ll wait.The list of books that are not as good as the movie is really short. I can think of eleven (I keep a running list on my profile page).  A Clockwork Orange,  The Devil Wears Prada and  The Perks of Being a Wallflower are flawed books that were turned into good movies.  Searching for Bobby Fischer,  Starship Troopers, Jaws, and  The Hunt for Red October are solid books that were turned into great movies. And four— The Martian,  The Godfather,  The Silence of the Lambs, and this book, The Princess Bride—are great books that were turned into all-time masterpiece-level movies.Mr. Goldman wrote the screenplay as well as the novel. In the movie, he used the framing device of the grandfather reading the story to his sick grandson. For a fairy tale, I think it’s better than the device in the book, which is more meta. William Goldman is a character in the novel, at first explaining how it came to be that he had published a “good parts” abridgment of the (completely fictitious) Florinese classic book by S. Morgenstern. He then appears in fourth-wall-breaking notes that pop up throughout the remainder of the book, making comments and explaining sections that he had edited out.But the core of the novel The Princess Bride—the fairy tale—is almost exactly as it is in the movie, and it’s wonderful. Westley and Buttercup. Fezzik, Inigo, and Vezzini. Humperdinck and Count Rugen. “As you wish.” “Inconceivable.” “I’m not left-handed.” “Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.” William Goldman was a brilliant writer. He wrote a great, inventive, sarcastic fairy tale novel. He then took the “good parts” of the novel and wrote a absolutely classic movie. A must-read.
