A part of me grieves that this is actually OVER, and that I have to say goodbye to these characters that I had come to love. Laia and Elias will always remain one of my most favorite fictional couple.Another part of me wishes I had enjoyed this finale book in the series as much as I wanted to. Sabaa Tahir has called this her best work so far, but book 1 still remains my most favorite book in this series. It warmed and touched me in a way I can never forget.I just couldn’t connect the same way with the other books in this series, especially books 3 and 4, probably because of some tropes that I personally don’t enjoy.But I’m so glad for having read these books, will defo reread book 1 in the future.
