im so very torn with this. the phenomenal writing, character narrative, and entire atmosphere of this book is easily worth 4+ stars. ST has grown remarkably as a writer, and, strictly from an objective storytelling point of view, this is probably the best book in the series. its very much a satisfying and appropriate conclusion to the story considering the events of the previous book.however, ‘a reaper at the gates’ was an instant mood changer for me regarding this series. my mind still fails to grasp that the characters from books 3-4 are the same characters i fell in love with in books 1-2. and i think its mainly because the story took a direction i did not fully support/enjoy, and so my relationship with the characters changed. so im feeling a little detached from this final installment, which is what i predicted would happen. again, this is a fantastic book and does the plot justice, but im still just personally not the biggest fan of said plot. i wanted more for my characters, but i get why everything works out the way it does. i have no doubt that lovers of the series will be very happy with this conclusion. ↠ 3.5 stars
