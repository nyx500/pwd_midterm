Wow, I did not expect this to be so intense and deep. This is such a robust and gripping modern day fantasy tale. So thoroughly entertaining. This author deserves a lot of acclaim for the complex and intricate world building alone. The unconventional perspective on fantasy was so refreshing. I was honestly shaken multiple times through the book due to the plot twists and bombshells, which kept me riveted.Can see this easily becoming a new favorite among fantasy lovers.
