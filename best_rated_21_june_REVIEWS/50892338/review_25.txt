MY MIND IS BLOWN RIGHT NOW. Wow, this book. It does have a slow start and took me awhile to get used to the whole magic system and Arthurian legend background. Bree was kind of thrown into this world, so I did enjoy learning about everything with her, it just took me a long time to get who was who among the tons of characters and how their magic/hierarchy worked. This book is so action-packed and the last 100 pages were ABSOLUTELY INSANE. I am still not sure what to think right now about what happened. I loved every second of this book and so many twists and turns were thrown in near the end. They all made sense, but I saw none of it coming and it was so good! And can we talk about Sel? He is definitely my favorite character of this book and I really hope we get more of him in the sequel. Bree was a great main character and I loved the depth to her. She was grieving losing her mother and was determined to find out the secrets behind who her mom was and what really happened behind her death. My heart went out to Bree and the loss she was going through, but I also loved the growth she went through and what she was able to learn and overcome. I could't recommend this book enough! I'm already dying for book two and I know that this ending is going to stick with me for a long time!
