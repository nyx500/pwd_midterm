4.5 ⭐️ Tracy Deonn don’t be shy, drop book 2 already! OMG I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH! The reason why I’m knocking off half a star is because there was so much information dump in the beginning and it took me a while to get into this book. honestly that’s more of a me problem. But once the plot started to thicken I was unstoppable. These characters are my new comfort characters and I will protect them at all cost. The best part about this book however, is the writing. This author literally has a gift. from the racism, sexism, and grief that Bree deals with throughout the book-is very real and very well written. the world building and magic system of this book, it did not disappoint. also not to be dramatic but i would die for Sel❤️ my merlin!
