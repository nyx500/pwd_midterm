Hot dang, this book is incredible. That's how you write a YA Contemporary Fantasy! ((applause for dayssss))Believe the hype, Legendborn is next level. I am so impressed with Tracy Deonn and cannot wait for the next book.I would recommend going into this knowing as little as possible; just let the story wash over you. It's complex and layered. The characters are wonderful and the magic system is incredibly creative.It's everything I look for in a Modern Urban Fantasy!!!The mystery of it kept me completely engaged. I couldn't put it down once I started.With the heavy fan-girling out of the way, let's get to the most serious question...WHEN DOES THE NEXT BOOK RELEASE!?Although, truth be told, I will probably read this again prior to the sequel. There is a lot of information packed in this novel and I need to have it fresh in my brain in order to continue.P.S. If you enjoyed this, you may want to check out Amari and the Night Brothers as well!!!
