there's that whole cliché about how doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results is the definition of insanity, but actually when it comes to me reading YA fantasy over and over and expecting to still like it, it's called "being brave."and in this case...i'm thrilled to announce i've been rewarded.i mean, kinda. this feels like the best possible take on a cliché - it's fun and readable, but the love triangles and the confusing magic and the instalove and the dialoguey info dumps are all still there.so i guess it's not that surprising that i really loved the first bit of this, but it took me 3 separate instances of picking it up to get through it.the friendship and father relationship were kinda left by the wayside, and, again, there was both instalove and a love triangle, the two laziest ways to insert romance...but the mother relationship was great. does it feel like we could have accomplished more in 544 pages? sure. but this is an incredibly long YA fantasy and i managed to finish it, and that says a lot in this day and age!!!bottom line: yay, basically!----------------tbr reviewme: i think i've outgrown YA fantasyalso me: time to add every single hyped book to my tbr
