Star Rating: —> 5 Stars[Buddy read with my bby Darceyyyyy !]11/12/2022— BRR with my bestie & lil sis, DARCEY! AGAIN (obv lol). Clearly ALL THE STARS I might just be a fan of a poly relationship in this series, I’ve realized! Deonn would do by the rep so, so very right! 🥰This is a novel of Arthurian legends retold & re-vamped, and amazing as hell Southern Black Girl Magic.(It kinda gave off some hunger games vibes at times, or maybe more HP-ish ones, actually? Maybe. Maybe a mix of both?Or more Shadowhunters? 🤔*thinking on it*)Regardless, just trust me on THIS, guys... THIS LEFT ME STUNNED! Consider me officially *SHOOKETH!*Legendborn seriously is such an EPIC READ; I could NOT tear myself away from this story, except for when I absolutely had to, & even then, my husband practically had to pry it from my hands. 😂! I say that with 100% honesty. This is such a unique, completely engrossing, make your heart race, AMAZING, & diverse novel! It puts a fresh new spin on some familiar themes, and introduces some that are completely original!This is, without a doubt, one of my top 5 favorite YA fantasy novels that i’ve read this year.The fact that it’s an #ownvoices novel made it all the better. I loved the non-binary & LGBTQIA+ reps, as well! (& Sel is PAN ! *Squeeeeeeeeee* Deonn confirmed it on twitter!!!)This book also has such a powerful message about Black women. About their strength, their tenacity, the injustices they have to face throughout their lives... It is just EPIC on ALL levels.So, yeah, I mean, what can I say... This book seriously made my heart SING & SOAR! And also makes it all hurt-y in the BEST WAY EVERRR.I also have to say...UHHH, GIRL F*CKING POWER. From moment ONE. the MC, BREE IS EFFING INCREDIBLE! She refuses to let people treat her unfairly, is 100% NOT afraid to share what’s on her mind, & is just so badass!And omg ALICE! GIRL... HELL TO THE YES, GET IT. Also, *PSA TIME*I had written that I was shipping a certain two people in one of my updates, but I must inform you that I am nowww officially aboard Ship “The Unknown”, after my reread 😂. Enough said.Just saying though…I mean srsly... I am so in love with Sel! He is so DAMN PRECIOUS!BUT NICK! I didn’t give him enough credit during my first read ! He is just so cute ! Ugh, choices, choices. SO HARD!Oh, hai there, newest book boyfriend(s)! *swoons*I always end up falling for the dark, haunted souls (being hot as hell sure does NOT hurt.) 😂It’s my thing. It’s what I do. 🤷🏼‍♀️1000 times over recommend!
