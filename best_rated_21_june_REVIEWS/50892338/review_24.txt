‚ÄúDon't make your life about the loss. Make it about the love.‚ÄùWhile I haven't been writing reviews really fast these days, I couldn't NOT write one right after finishing this book because AH, I AM OBSESSED.I had very high expectations because I haven't heard a bad thing about this book, and while it took me FOREVER to read this (it's all my fault, I'm reading too many books right now), I FLEW through it once I actually allowed myself to get sucked in, and my sky high expectations were met!!‚ÄúLove is a powerful thing, more powerful than blood, although both run through us like a river.‚ÄùThis may be a me thing, but in the beginning this book was really confusing. Like there was so much stuff I had to learn and so much information was being thrown out there. I still am really confused about some things, but I managed to make it through the book, so that's a plus.I liked how speedy the plot was too- nothing seemed really slow, and, especially in the final chapters, so much was going on. I was always on the edge of my seat and was gasping out loud and making these strange shocked noises.The writing was also gorgeous. It just flowed so well with the story and it helped tell the story so well, with all its complexities and twists. The world felt real and whole, as did the characters (which as a character driven person, I loved).Also, the twists were so well done! Like I was so shocked at the end, with all those twists and I NEED the next book (it is a necessity, not even just a want anymore, a necessity)‚ÄúTwo faults. My race and my gender. But they are not faults. They are strength. And I am more than this man can comprehend.‚ÄùI LOVE BREE WITH MY WHOLE HEART. I haven't liked a main protagonist this much in a very long time. For once, I was never annoyed with the decisions she made, and she was extremely rational and I understood the reasonings behind all of her actions. She is also a literal queen, like whenever she stood up to people I was beaming down at my book so much. Her character felt so real- her trauma and grief was so well written and I could feel Bree's sadness and loss. The racism Bree had to deal with felt so well-written, and all of these issues were wonderfully talked about.I loved Nick a lot in the beginning, and while I still like him now, it's just a little less. That's only because, since I'm incredibly dramatic, I don't ship him and Bree together. But we'll get to that later. He's so sweet and loving and I can tell how much he cares about Bree.Moving on to Sel, my new favorite male character. I. LOVE. HIM. SO. MUCH. His dark, brooding, sarcastic attitude (we all know by now how much I adore these kinds of characters) combined with the fact that he's got dark hair, golden eyes, AND TATTOOS=PERFECTION. AND WHAT MAKES IT EVEN BETTER: UNDERNEATH THE BROODING DARK SURFACE IS THE FACT THAT HE DEEPLY CARES FOR SOME PEOPLE AND WOULD KILL PEOPLE TO SAVE THEM. AH üôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüõêüõêüßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSEL>>>NICKI'M A SEL GIRLIE ALL THE WAY THROUGHthank you‚ÄúWhy someone dies is not the same question as why they are gone.‚ÄùThe romance is one of my favorite parts. At least, it will be if Sel and Bree end up together. I SWEAR TO GOD IF THEY DON'T-In the beginning I was wary because I hate love triangles and I knew that this one had one, but it's hardly really there, and thankfully I still like the guy I'm not rooting for (Nick if you can't already tell)I really want to see how the romance progresses in Bloodmarked because the synopsis says "growing attraction" to Sel (believe me, when I read that part I giggled and kicked my feet) despite her love for Nick (not gonna lie, I hope the love diminishes to friendship üòÉüòÉ).Anywho, BREE AND SEL FOR LIFE‚ÄúSome truths only tragedy can teach.‚ÄùOverall, I loved this book so much and I really need the next one. I won't break my book ban because I don't want to just order one book on Amazon (whenever I do buy more books it'll definitely be more than one) but I REALLY want Bloodmarked right now. I cannot wait to get to it.I've said something like this already but: SELWYN KANE CAN STEP ON ME5 stars‚ÄúThey that would be a leader, let them be a bridge.‚Äù<><><><><><><>HOLY SHIT.
