I suppose I asked for it. Stroud did not disappoint. I wanted to see some profound acts of selflessness and boy did I ever. I'll hand it to Stroud, he stayed true to his style the whole way through. No coddling, kiddies. And I say that most pointedly, as I find it difficult to imagine how this series ever made it to the Young Adult shelf--it's merciless, is what I'm saying. Not even a goodbye kiss, and I think that stung most of all.No happy endings, at least, not in the typical way, either. I mean, even Tolkien let us have all our little hobbits in the end. Sure, Rowling killed off a few of our favs, but the trio lived to have their cheesy flash-forward on the platform. But, Stroud, the proud realist, gives us neither the salvation of our lead, nor the rosy glimpse of the future. So, two of the main characters lived. I guess that's pretty fair odds, two out of three. Still, dead is dead. And as is the way of the living, any brush with death, even fictional, has a tendency to leave a somber shadow. And of course Nathaniel was my favorite all along, because he had the biggest challenge, the biggest change to make, and he did it, just like I hoped he would. Though it's decidedly soured my taste for acts of heroism in all forms. And I feel remarkably less of a romantic than I was when I began this story. Sort of like how I imagine the pain of silver might feel to a djinn's essence. Ah well.
