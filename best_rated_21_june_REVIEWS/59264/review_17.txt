The British empire is falling apart, even as its troops are fighting off the rebellion in America. Commoners are starting to protest in the streets of London, as they see the casualty numbers. Meanwhile, the elite magicians cannot put aside their personal ambitions for a moment, to think through how to preserve their country and their empire.Young Nathaniel, a magician who is slipping away from his earlier idealism, writes wartime propaganda for hometown consumption. Idealistic, feisty Kitty Jones seeks to educate the commoners about the limitations of magic, and the truth behind their oppression. She seeks a way for commoners and demons to combine forces, to overthrow the magicians.This novel is the third in the Bartimaeus trilogy. It is hilarious, as we hear Bartimaeus in his usual witty, sarcastic, sometimes long-winded comments as he struggles to satisfy his master, Nathaniel. The three main characters, Bartimaeus, Nathaniel, and Kitty must learn to trust one another, in the climactic conclusion of the story. This is not easy, as magicians look upon demons as "slaves", commoners look upon magicians as oppressive overlords, and demons look at all humans with disdain, and sometimes even with hatred.As with the first two books, I listened to this one as an audiobook, narrated by Simon Jones. He is marvelous, giving the dialog exactly the right touch. He makes the book "spring to life" in a way that is wonderful, and full of fun.
