In this fantastic ending to a wonderful trilogy, Jonathan Stroud has managed to do something that I find is rarely done in any series. With Nathaniel, Kitty, and most importantly, Bartimaeus back for another riveting book, deeper conflicts emerge that we didn't fully understand in the previous two books. With secrets from Bartimaeus's past, we get a window peek at The Other Place, and a slowly changing relationship between the three characters, this book is by far the greatest ending to the trilogy. Something interesting about Stroud's style of writing for this series, which was separating the narration between all three main characters, I find that what he creates is a perfect balance. Although Kitty's and Nathaniel's are both written in third person, Bartimaeus's is written in first. By doing so, Stroud has created a more personal bond with Bartimaeus than with the humans. By creating a bond with the deamon, we see the faults in Nathaniel and the things that make Kitty special and different. This plays with our emotions throughout, and at the end, I think, cause the perfect mix of sadness, excitement, and curiosity. The thing I value the most about this ending, is the fact that it's not the perfect, pretty in pink, happy ending we have seen so much of. It clearly shows that the world won't become perfect after it, that sometime hero's fall and not for noble causes but for selfish ones, and we are left with so many questions that will not be answered, leaving it up to our imaginations and creativity. For that, I am extremely grateful and happy with this book. Five stars and two thumbs up!!
