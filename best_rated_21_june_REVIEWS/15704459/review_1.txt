My name is David Charleston. I kill people with superpowers.AFTER GETTING YOUR GOAL... WHAT?David Charleston’s life couldn’t be better now, in this dystopian world where insane superpowered humans keep killing and destroying anything at their reach, since after years of being studying the “Epics” (how this superpowered humans are referred), learning how their powers work, but more important what their weaknesses are, to know how to kill them all, now he is a member of the secretive organization known as The Reckoners, the only thing between the Epics and total destruction of the planet, and even better, his main goal, Steelheart, the Epic who killed his father, he was able to discover what was his weakness.However, while David is 19 years old (just having his 19th birthday) and many people could consider him someone still too young, he is feeling like he already got his lifetime goal, and now he isn’t certain what’s next in his life.Moreover, his vision about the Epics is now a conflictive one.Just one year ago, it was simple, he wants to kill all Epics since all Epics were evil, however, now he met some Epics that aren’t evil, some are doing what they can to fight Epics and some of them are willing to help humanity as long they aren’t disturbed and having time to read, but even more conflictive, there are Epics that he wants to believe that they aren’t evil no matter how much evidence there is against it.His simple world where he just needed to keep his head down to avoid getting attention to him while doing his secret investigation where all Epics were evil and deserved to die, are long gone.Now he lives in a complicated world where even the Reckoners are getting into “terra incognita” since they used to be an underground organization where they kill low level Epics, getting in and out of any city in matter of weeks, even each cell team of Reckoners knew very little about the operations of other cells. Actually, many people were unaware of the existence of such organization or believing that they were some kind of urban legend.However, now the population of Newcago already knew that the Reckoners were very real and even they were doing an openly public protection of the city against the invasion of any outsider Epic, but that doesn’t mean that they were looking to rule the city, they were trying their best to respect the new governing council, ironically formed by many high class normal people that they were the same in a privileged position while Steelheart was the dictator of the city. Superpowers may change but politics remain the same even in a dystopian reality.And David Charleston is the new public sensation of Newcago. Davis is now known as the Steelslayer. A simple puny human that was able to defeat a god.But I don’t kill them for vengeance, not anymore. This thing we do… for me, it’s like putting down a rabid dog. It’s a mercy.A NEW SCENARIOWelcome to Babylon Restored, David,......the world’s greatest enigma.Newcago, the former Chicago, was now free again, but as this city was ruled once, by an Epic, there were other cities still under the insane ruling of other Epics.The “lucky” cities were still under the insane ruling of Epics. Since there were many cities totally destroyed now due the even more insane actions of yet other Epics.It was obvious that the Reckoners couldn’t do anything about the already destroyed cities, but the victory over Steelheart was demanding a game change. Instead of keeping killing low level Epics, they had to go agains the High Epics ruling major cities.Just like Babylon Restored......formerly known as New York City.Babylar or Babylon Restored is ruled by Regalia, a powerful Epic that even considering that she isn’t classified as an “High Epic”, she was able to control the entire city. Regalia also has other Epics working for her as their “field muscle”. The Reckoners had already a cell team doing research and surveillance on Babylar, so Prof left behind in Newcago his personal cell team to keep protection of that city, but having with him the support of Tia and David, and joining the cell established in Babylar.Every organization needs both good chefs and good morticians. The two great constants of life. Food and death.The only city that David has ever known had been Newcago, and soon enough he will be amazed, shocked, worried and even clueless about Babylar and how different the things are managed there, mysteries at plain sight and danger all around him.You can’t immerse yourself in something,......without coming to respect it.If you think that Steelheart was awesome, your appraisement about this sequel, Firefight, will be even greater!Firefight keeps developing this uncanny dystopian world where superpowered villains rule with iron fist the defenseless non-powered humanity, BUT with a refreshed vision where any recidivism of the status quo about the narrative of the first book is changed with new rules, new scenarios, new characters, new kind of dangers, new levels of excitement, also where even the already known characters (from the first book) won’t remain the same and taking unexpected developments!We want what we can't have, even when we have no right to demand it.
