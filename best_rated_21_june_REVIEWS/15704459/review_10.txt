Slowly sinking in that I have to wait around a year before book 3 comes out.I was expecting a lot more from this, because I know Sanderson could've done better. To keep it short, this wasn't Sanderson level.The reckoners continue their mission of killing epics. Compared to Steelheart, this second installment had a vague goal. They were trying to do a lot of things simultaneously, resulting to confusion of the main goal of the novel. There were also too much bad guys than necessary. Two should've been enough. I know that he introduced quite a lot for the development of the plot, but I didn't seem to enjoy each of them because some were more invested on than others. The plot was enjoyable overall, but could've been executed better.The characters improved as compared to the first one. That should be a requirement, and Sanderson managed to comply. I felt remorse toward most characters, and the David-Megan thing continues to grow on me. The minor characters are also interesting, they seem to do their job and really support the main ones. Sanderson managed to impress me once again with his amazing character development. 3.5/5 stars. Not that impressed, but hopefully the next one would be a lot better than this.
