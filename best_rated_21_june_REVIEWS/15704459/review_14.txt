This sequel to Steelheart was of a similar quality. Good, but not quite as good as Sanderson's regular fantasy series. It would have been better if it was longer. The ending was exciting, but it did feel a little rushed. The setting changed from NewCago to Babylon Restored, or Manhattan as we pre-Calamity people might call it. Babylon Restored was as unique and interesting a place as NewCago. The flooded city was interesting and the glowing fruits and lights provided by the mysterious Dawnslight were pretty cool. The new Epic in the Reckoners sights was Regalia. She rules in Babylon Restored and had provoked the Reckoners by sending rogue Epics, like Mitosis, to plague them in NewCago. She was an interesting villain and very different from Steelheart. With Cody and Abraham left behind in NewCago David, Prof, and Tia were joined by some new team members. Mizzy was the most likable of the new characters, but Val and Exel were interesting in their own ways. Megan was present as well and it was her scenes with David that were my favorite parts of the story. We learned some cool stuff about the Epics and Calamity and the ending was shocking and exciting. All in all this was a fast paced and fun read. Just what a superhero book should be! I'm looking forward to reading the conclusion to the trilogy. Rating: 4.5 stars.Audio Note: MacLeod Andrews does a decent job narrating this series.
