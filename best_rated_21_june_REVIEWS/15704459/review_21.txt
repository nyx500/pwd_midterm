So goodreads lost the long review I just wrote about Firefight and I'm too exasperated to write another. Here is my lazy version:David was useless and annoyingly obsessed with Megan. Manhattan was awesome, a hippy city. The ending blew my mind. I'm going to keep going with the Reckoners series eventually. There were way too many bad puns in this book though.
