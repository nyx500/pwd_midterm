Reread of paperback for Tome Topple. Changed my star rating from 4 to 5. All the stars for Nighteyes as I am the wolf loverI know I don't need to be listening to first time books on audio. I know, I know, I know. But I'm trying to save my eyeballs so I'm reading whatever they have on Overdrive and doing my re-reads through audible and Overdrive until I get them on audible. Why am I rambling about this?! Well, the reason is that I fought back and forth over giving this a 3 star or a 4 star. I mean I was trying to figure out if Nighteyes was the only reason I even enjoyed the book or what. Do I want to re-read it through my paperback later on. I DON'T KNOW! I'm so confused on how I feel about the book. That ending though right? FinMel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
