4-4.5/5 stars. I can’t quite decide. Loved the book, but didn’t love it as much as the first. I can’t pinpoint why at the moment, though if I figure it out I’ll come back and update. Otherwise, it had all the things I loved from the first - a slow building, richly felt political fantasy novel with dangers at every turn.
