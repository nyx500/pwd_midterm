I very much enjoyed this on audiobook and plan to finish the trilogy that way, as I think it would be much slower going on physical copy. This is much more of a character driven fantasy, focused on slow subtle moments between characters and an intricate web of interactions. And wow does Hobb love to make her main character suffer. But I’m glad I’m seeing Fitz grow up so that I can enjoy the entire Realm of the Elderling series with this as the foundation.
