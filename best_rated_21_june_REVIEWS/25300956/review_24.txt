Buddy read with Markus! Who unlike me, wrote a coherent and thoughtful review you can read here.----------------752 pages. This book was 752 pages long.ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!Dune is less than 752 pages.If you combine The Fellowship of the Rings and The Two Towers together, it's still less than 752 pages. And in both cases, even with the comparable page count they managed to condense a LOT of story between their covers.In this case we had 752 pages of filler. Very little happened, and the plot almost didn't move. You could have condensed the action in what? 200 pages? Here's a resume of what happens: Fitz bonds with a new animal. There's a "romance" angle that I hated.Verity goes on a quest.Regal is still the bad guy.We still don't know anything about the red ships. That's mostly it. There are plot lines here and there that are left unresolved, and the book ends with a very interesting twist. But most of it was insufferably boring and I only finished it because I was buddy reading it with a friend. I will still read the next book, because I really liked the first one and I want to know what happens with the red ships. But I'm not sure I'll read anything else in the Elderlings series.
