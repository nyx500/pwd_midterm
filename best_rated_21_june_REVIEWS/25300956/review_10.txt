A big shout out to my fierce and loyal wolven brother Nighteyes. He is everything in this book.Robbin Hobb knew how to grab your attention. Intrigue, magic, conflicts, characterization. The smell of danger hidden behind the political upheaval, a twist of fate.She gave you a perfect world to immerse in.After finishing Assassin’s Apprentice, I became so invested in the story that I saw Fitz as my son. Let’s ignore the fact that at my age I hardly can have a son as old as him, but the truth is I don’t care. It was lovely to see how my boy grew in the second book. I was heartbroken to witness the suffering he endured, but I was so proud to see what he had achieved.I fell hard for Burrich. I couldn’t help it, I have always loved the kind of grumpy man who is secretly soft in heart. He was the one who always truly cared for Fitz. It might be just a responsibility for him at first for his respect and loyalty to Chivalry, but you can tell how he grew attached to Fitz and tried his best to raise him as his son. I’m afraid I don’t care for the relationship between Fitz and Molly. I appreciated Robin Hobbs's effort to make Molly seem to be a mentally strong character, but in my eyes she had too much drama in her. I tried to understand her, but her constant and unnecessary drama really wearied me and nearly ruined the whole book.I’m curious why it seems that epic fantasy writers can always depict a likable female protagonist (I love Kettricken) but can never make the one that matches with the male protagonist likable?Overall, the magical and epic world Robin Hobb built up helped me ignore the weakness in this book, and I am looking forward to reading the next book.
