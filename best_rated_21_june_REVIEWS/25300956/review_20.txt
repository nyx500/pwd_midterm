Full video review here: https://youtu.be/zNRKYZOeGfsWow what a followup and absolutely beautifully tragic story Robin Hobb has created here. Easily one of the best books I've read this year. Hobb improved on Assassin's Apprentice in damn near every conceivable way with this entry. It's full of great characters, tragic storylines, and absolutely gorgeous writing. The hype and praise is to be believed for this book, that was excellent.
