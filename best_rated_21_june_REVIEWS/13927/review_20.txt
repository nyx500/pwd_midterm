I think I enjoyed this second book in the Sevenwaters series more than the first. It had the same great feel and immersive worldbuilding, but the romance thread was stronger and I was here for that.The blurb made me think this was another book about Sorcha and Red, but it's not. This book centers on her daughter, Liadan. Like her mother, Liadan is a healer and herbalist, and those skills made her the target of mercenaries who needed help to save one of their injured friends. It was in their custody, she met Bran, their leader. Bran is a wounded hero with a hard shell. He became a criminal for hire in the wake of a tragic childhood. And he wants no ties, save for his men.Liadan doesn't want to fall for him any more than he wants to fall for her, but you know how these things go. I liked the development of the romance, since it's one of my favorite tropes.That being said, as much as I enjoyed it overall, the book wasn't perfect. Like it's predecessor, I found the heroine too young for my taste. A sixteen year-old isn't a woman and I had a hard time putting her age aside. I also didn't like her sister, who was supposed to be sympathetic... I think? When bad things happened to her, I was still kind of focused on what a brat she was. And I felt the reveal on why she couldn't be with her lover was kind of anticlimactic. (Dude, I remembered his name from the first book.)I was also kind of bummed out that the author killed off a bunch of characters from book 1. These people were in their 30s for crying out loud, and I cared about them. And they were dropping like flies.Still, I read the whole thing in less than a day and I'm about 30 seconds away from downloading book 3 from the library, so that should tell you something. Juliet Marillier pulls me into her books and I'm in no hurry to pull myself out.
