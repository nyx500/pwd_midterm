2022 Review I mean, Mendanbar. While I love the independence and girl power of the first book, this is the one I re-read most frequently. 2017 ReviewSlow re-read over the past few weeks. A charming story with the ever un-traditional and amazing Cimorene, the wise Morwen, intellectual Telemain, and sweet Mendanbar. I really love them all.  Am I officially getting old? Mendanbar is practically a baby, just 20!
