Patricia C. Wrede has been one of my favorite authors for her witty, original use of common fantasy themes. This is the 2nd book of her 4 book series, and is one of my favorites. This book is a great read for all ages, with laugh out loud humor. Violence: mild g-rated violence with melting wizards, and fighting rock-snakes.Language: Mendenbar takes the Lord's name in vain about 3 times, but that is all, the rest is "he cursed under his breath," etc.Sexual themes: G-rated pressure for Mendenbar to get married, and innocent attraction between him and someone else. Age recommendation: All ages (Any age old enough to understand and enjoy it).
