The Society of Wizards are stirring up trouble again in this second book of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. This time, they are trying to start a war between the King of the Enchanted Forest, (Mendanbar) and the King of the Dragons (Kazul), by burning a section of his forest, leaving dragon scales as evidence. Mendanbar decides a state visit to King Kazul is long overdue and sets out for such a visit, only to find a distraught Princess Cimorene, who is concerned that Kazul has disappeared and not sent word. Together, they set out on a quest to find and rescue Kazul. The banter between Mendanbar and Cimorene is wonderful, Morwen and Telemain were very helpful along the way, and some of their challenges were worrying, including magic carpets, meddling giants, and Jack the peddler. I liked this book much better than the first one in this series.
