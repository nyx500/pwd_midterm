wow!!!!! just want to say this was awesome. wondrous. marvelous. just wow! review later I hope.okay I need to get this rant off my chest. major spoilers! Arcadius. Killing Gwen does not make sense! I know we are supposed to buy oohh scary emperor Royce part and that he did this to keep Mercy because he thought Royce was some special brand of sociopath. I don't. One, you are a fucking old man who keeps this shit secret from everybody but one woman in a time of war and you just put up a sign on your forehead that you have a secret in front of psychopathic church sentinel whose only mission in his life is to kill the heir and his line, who has only you and said woman to protect her and give her the knowledge that she is the daughter of the heir. even if you don't take the dangers and every other shit that is going on into consideration, you don't have a guarantee that the kid won't be lost in some fucked up way and grow up just like her father and turn into another sociopath. so what does this genius of a man do? he goes and kills the only person the said sociopath loves, taking a gamble with a shit hand that requires years of maybes to come to fruition. when he could make sure Gwen ,on whose request Royce would roll over and die, is safe and sound to be the softening influence in him.you want to raise the heir with your knowledge? all you have to do is to ask royce because he sees you as a supplement father. but nooooo he has to be one to DO shit. because only he can decide the best, impart the necessary knowledge and raise a better person. well, fuck you old man. rot in whatever literary hell you are in. burn burn burn.
