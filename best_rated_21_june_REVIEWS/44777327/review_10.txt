This will be an odd review ;) And why can we not give more than 5 stars?So happy I didn't have to send Michael J. Sullivan hate mail because of......Royce;)Just put him in my top 10 authors and that is saying a lot.This series was one of the best I have read. Yes, that's what I said ;)It has everything a reader could want and if you respect my opinions as far as books go, you will read this series and anything else Michael writes, if you have not already.Now for the review;"A white feather drifted downward. It swirled, blowing on a gentle breeze until it was close enough that the tall spindly man in the white powdered wig reached up and caught it between his fingers. He kissed it gently, then slipped it into his leather pouch. He pulled the bag closed and continued on his way, whistling a merry tune, until he passed behind a hill and was gone."And all was right with the world........Thank you Michael J Sullivan, for writing.It is good to know that Bards still exist, you are an amazing Wordsinger.I just love happy endings.
