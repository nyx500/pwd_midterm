i really dont want to spoil anything but i am beyond happy with the conclusion of this trilogy. which rarely ever happens - usually i lose interest as a series progresses, but this was the opposite for me - it only got better! i enjoyed how the story was wrapped up nicely (not without a few twists here and there) and loved that everything fell into place for the better. the ending was a little abrupt in my opinion (which left me wanting more), and i still believe all three books should have been combined into one instead of being separated, but overall i have nothing but positive feelings for this story!4 stars
