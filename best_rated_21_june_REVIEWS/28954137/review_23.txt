Ghosts of the Shadow Market ★★★★-----------------------------------------------Welcome to the Shadowhunter Academy★★★★“Everybody in this academy, Shadowhunters and mundanes, people with the Sight and without it, every one of them is looking to be a hero. We are all hoping for it, and trying for it, and soon we will be bleeding for it. You’re just like the rest of us, Si. Except there’s one thing about you that’s different: We all want to be heroes, but you know you can be one. You know in another life, in an alternate universe, however you want to think of it, you were a hero. You can be one again. Maybe not the same hero, but you have it in you to make the right choices, to make the big sacrifices. That’s a lot of pressure. But it’s a lot more hope than any of the rest of us have. Think about it that way, Simon Lewis, and I think you’re pretty lucky.”2016 - OH SIMON HOW I'VE MISSED YOU! Also, I LOVE George!2020 - Knowing how these stories end, reading this is so depressing omg. The friendship between Simon and George is EVERYTHING.The Lost Herondale★★★“We are all what our pasts have made us,” Catarina said. “The accumulation of thousands of daily choices. We can change ourselves, but never erase what we’ve been.��2020 - this one was lowkey kinda boring lol. I think from what I can remember, this is probably my least favourite cassie clare anthology? But we shall see!The Whitechapel Fiend★★★★“To his children, Will showed the same love he had always shown to her, fierce and unyielding. And the same protectiveness he had only ever showed to one other person: the person James had been named after. Will’s parabatai, Jem.”2016 - SO MANY OF MY FAVE CHARACTERS IN THIS ONE <32020 - oh my gosh, baby james herondale yelling 'spoon' is the highlight of this entire book lolNothing But Shadows★★★★★“Do not let any of them tell you who you are. You are the flame that cannot be put out. You are the star that cannot be lost. You are who you have always been, and that is enough and more than enough. Anyone who looks at you and sees darkness is blind.”2016 - THIS ONE WAS AMAZING2020 - rereading this after reading chain of gold is EVERYTHING. I love these characters SO MUCH. The Evil We Love★★.5“Love, real love, is being seen. Being known. Knowing the ugliest part of someone, and loving them anyway. And... I guess I think two people in love become something else, something more than the sum of their parts, you know? That it must be like you’re creating a new world that exists just for the two of you. You’re gods of your own pocket universe.”2020 - yooooo this was boring lolPale Kings and Princes★★★“It's hard to believe how much light you can find in the darkness, when you have someone who loves you.”2020 - I love helen and aline with my whole heart. Bitter of Tongue★★★“Every night, no matter what has happened during the day, no matter if I am torn and bloodied or so bone-tired I wish I were dead, I look up at the stars and I give each star a brother's name or a sister's face. I will not sleep until I remember every one. The stars will burn out before I forget.”2020 - this story is so bittersweet. On the one hand, seeing mark was so sad, but then aline and helen's wedding??? I love them. The Fiery Trial★★★.5“It was nice, Simon thought, in the midst of all the terrible things that could happen and sometimes did happen, there was always this. There was a lot of love.”2016 - this one was WEIRD2020 - this was super weird.. but I kinda enjoyed it???Born to Endless Night★★★★.5“I never want anything but this, I never want a less strange love.”2016 - :')2020 - if I wasn't already about to have a baby, this woulda given me massive baby fever oh ma LORDAngels Twice Descending★★★★“It's not cowardly to make a choice about what you want your life to be. Choosing what's right for you, maybe that's the bravest thing you can do.”2016 - I guessed what was going to happen early on in this novella series, but it still hurt :(2020 - will I ever forgive cassandra clare for this? Nope, definitely not. Overall Rating: 3.65
