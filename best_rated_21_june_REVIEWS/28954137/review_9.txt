“It didn’t feel like bravery. It simply felt like taking the next step forward.”I’m going to bury myself in a hole so that I can scream and cry in peace with my emotions to be whisked away by Lovelace ghosts. A moment of silence because these stories were so nostalgic but also creative and highly emotional. I feel like all of these short stories were essential in understand the “whys” of the conflicts and just amazing additional content for any shadowhunter fan. In case you are wondering:I recommend reading this short story collection after you’ve read The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices but before The Dark Artifices and The Last Hours. also I’m just simply shadowhunter trash.The stories are so well done in this compilation and the way it kept tying back to the academy was creative. I was crying in every timeline and it gives me joy at how much content this world has. It might be intimidating from the outside but when you're in it... you're in.everyone constantly points out the aspects of the characters that they don’t like and they find annoying but even though I respect their opinions… I just do not see it 😹 Me reading this and being once again acquainted to the TMI characters after 4 years just supports that. I don’t think there’s a character in this series that I find annoying or hate (yes I’m talking about Jace), I just really am so blinded by love.“As long as you can find people who spoke the language of your soul, you will never be alone.”Welcome to the Shadowhunter Academy: ★★★★★(4.5)I feel like it's the nostalgia talking but also the character relationships and dynamics built here was so cute <3The Lost Herondale: ★★★★☆(4.0)This was hearbreaking and full of foreshadowingThe Whitechapel Fiend: ★★★★★ (4.5)James is so adorableee. I want to cry. Love that this goes through a lot of the character dynamics <3“Danger is appealing, especially to those who have nothing to lose.”Nothing but Shadows: ★★★★★ (5.0)PARABATAIS!!! WE LOVE TO SEE IT! Yeah I am actually crying. I am tempted to just skip TDA and go straight to TLH. Emotional as always. James and Matthew have my heart.“If you saw humanity as I can see it, there is very little brightness and warmth for me... You are who you have always been. And that is enough. That is more than enough.”The Evil We Love: ★★★★☆ (3.5)It was so interesting to see this side of the Circle and getting into the mind of Robert Lightwood and Valentine. A lot of these stories are centered around the parabatai bonds and I just love that.Pale Kings and Princes: ★★★☆☆ (3.5)That last part though... my emotionBitter of Tongue: ★★★★☆ (3.5)MARK BLACKTHORN <333 all of the blackthorns to be honest“We have to be what kind of shadowhunters we wanted to be and show them.”The Fiery Trial: ★★★☆☆ (3.5)Oh that was FUN! It was nice seeing how the parabatai ceremony works and these short stories really do add a lot to the plot and the build up.Born to Endless Night: ★★★★★ (4.5)The highlight of this story is Robert Lightwood suggesting that Alec and Magnus magicked a baby. I also realized that Alec basically inherited Will’s features. Magnus Bane as a constant in every shadowhunter novel is one of the best decisions CC has made.Angels Twice Descending: ★★★★★ (4.5)OHMYGOD JESSAMINE. I sobbed“The point was you lived.”
