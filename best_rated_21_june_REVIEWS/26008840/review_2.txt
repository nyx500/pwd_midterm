Extraordinary storytelling and so full of surprises! Ophélie is a great heroine! Loved this 2nd of 4! The world of the Pôle is one of treachery and hypocrisy (why does that feel so relevant just now?) and Ophélie is working hard to survive and learn as things change and the mystery of Dieu continues to unfold. Archibald is a fantastic character (not just because I named my kid with that same name though!) and we get to hang with Renard and Gaëlle some more as well. And excellent followup to the first book in this quartet!
