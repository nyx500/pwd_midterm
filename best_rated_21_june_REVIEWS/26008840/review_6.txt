After reading the first book of this saga, I thought the setting was charming, but the plot (which a friend of mine described as a never-ending introduction) scant and scarcely enticing. This second book has had me take such critique back. starting off on the backburner, there was a moment I was about to give it up. Then, something changed and the book turned abruptly into a real page-turner. Now, Iâ€™m craving for a film adaptation.
