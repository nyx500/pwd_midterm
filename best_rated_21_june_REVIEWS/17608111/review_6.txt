I enjoyed the first book of this series very much and it got me interested in further exploring of the flintlock fantasy so I was eager to continue with this series and to find out was my infatuation with Promise of Blood a one time thing and after reading this I must say that it grew into something more; it grew into affection.I could ramble on about this book but that would be hard to do without giving away important parts of the story so Iâ€™ll refrain from rambling and I'll keep it simple.Reading this felt exactly like that.
