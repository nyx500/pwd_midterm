Reading this book was epic, I hate that it ended with a cliffhanger though. Its a good thing all the books have already been published, I can't imagine what waiting would have felt. Gladly this book didn't suffer from middle book syndrome, the plot here is even better than the first book. I'm getting used to the characters and I love them. The battle scenes were still awesome, I really enjoyed reading them. I love the way the author depicted the character relationship, it was realistic, Adamat's dedication for his family, Taniel and Ka'Poel, Bo etc.The world building is amazing, I loved it, the author described the scenery so well. The writing is also very comprehensible, the book is written from Adamat, Taniel, Tamas and Nila's point of view, Nila has more POVs here than the first book I hope that continues. Its just Adamat's POV that I find boring most of the time, I wish the author will just shorten it.Like I mentioned earlier the characters are well developed, my favourite is still Taniel, despite his strong headedness I still like him his character has more development, anything there is a POV switch I long to go back to his POV, that is how awesome it is.. I also like Ka Poel, her magic is even more formidable than I thought, I just wish she has a POV, she is so awesome, I would love to know what goes on in her head. BO and Nila are also cool, I just wish Nila would drop the Mary Sue attitude. Despite all of Tamas' flaws I still like him, now that I know why he killed the king he kind of scares me. Adamat, Gavril, Vlora, Olem are all memorable characters.The events here took place shortly after the first book. Tamas is stuck behind enemy lines, Taniel is trying to increase the army's moral because they assumed that Tamas is dead and they is no hope for them. Adamat is trying to find his family and Nila is trying to stay alive.
