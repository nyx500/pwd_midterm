I had a hard time deciding if i liked this or not.This book have 4 different POVs. Tamas, Taniel, Adamat & Nila.Both Tamas' and Taniel's POVs were great. Action packed, full of mystery & intrigue, and a great storytelling for some well built characters (Including sidekicks as Ka-Poel, Olem & Mihali). Adamat's and Nila's POVs in the other hand, were quite boring. I, not once, found myself interested in Adamat's family, the young Eldaminse, or even Lord Veta's fortune.I was torn between 3 & 4 stars. I will go with 4, just because Bo was featured in Adamat's and Nila's POVs. I may though change my choice in the future, and come back to deduct a star.You can find more of my reviews over at http://BookNest.eu/
