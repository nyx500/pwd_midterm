Mini review:DNFAs I have mentioned before Tamora Pierce is a well respected fantasy author. Lately I have been trying to get into her books. Wild Magic in particular caught my eye. I used to watch the Eliza Thornberry cartoon as a child. It sounded like that but in a fantasy setting. Unfortunately this wasn't for me. I am finding that her books just aren't for me. I wasn't invested and just didn't care for the characters. I will not be reading any off her other books. I do still recommend.
