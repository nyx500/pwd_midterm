Okay so first of all a great re-read for me. I love Daine!Of all the powers in the Tortall Universe I love Daine's the most. I love that she can communicate with animals!There was a lot happening in this book. I don't want to get too spoilery but it made my heart pound in excitement, fear and joy. I love how Daine has made her own home and her own family with some lovely and familiar characters. The last bit where Daine says she goes from no home to too many is just key!
