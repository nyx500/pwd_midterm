There was magic, beautiful and monstrous mythical creatures, and the emergence of a young heroine’s immense power; what’s not to like. This was a fantastic story telling by Tamara Pierce. I loved it from the first page, it was an incredible, immersive, engrossing page turner.I love the characters, Daine with her knack and connection with animals. I really loved how she surprises the people around her with uncanny victories over formidable opponents, there was never a dull moment. This is the first in a four series book; I’m moving on to the next book.
