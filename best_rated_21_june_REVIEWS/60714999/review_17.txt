Recently, this book has blown up and I've just seen 5 star after 5 star review for it. I already had it on my TBR and with everyone saying such good things about it, I decided to give it a try. And even with my expectations super high, IT STILL SMASHED MY EXPECTATIONS THROUGH THE ROOF 🤭🤭😍😍🤌🤌“Never trust. Never yield. Always guard your heart.”The Serpent and the Wings of Night follows Oraya, a human girl fighting to survive in a world of vampires. She is the adopted daughter of the Nightborn vampire king and is determined to carve her place in this brutal kingdom. To become more than prey, she enters the Kejari, a brutal, legendary tournament held by the goddess of death. Winning won't be easy- Oraya is pitted against brutal predators and with deadly tasks and growing feelings for a fellow competitor, it may Oraya everything just to stay alive.“Perhaps I didn’t share his blood, but I was his child in every other sense of the word, and he loved me the only way he knew how. At the edge of a blade.” Everyone told me this was good, but I'm still reeling at HOW GOOD it was. Everything about this was just perfection. I. AM. OBSESSED. 🤭🤭🤌🤌Starting with the characters. It's only been 500 pages with these characters, but I already love them all sm!! So many good characters here and they all have so many different layers! ✨➡️ Oraya:Oraya is our MC and she is struggling- she's trying to survive in a world where everyone wants to kill her. But Oraya won't take that lying down. She is determined to be the predator rather than the prey.Okay I LOVED Oraya!! 😍😍 I immediately connected to her and she felt like she could jump right out the pages, she was that well-developed. She was also SO badass and I was cheering her on the whole time! Queen 👑👑 So excited to see more of her as the books keep getting published ❤➡️ Raihn:Okay but how is he so hot 😩😩😩🔥🔥🔥 He's the main love interest in the series and he's a vampire with WINGS. Like, c'mon. Don't tell me he doesn't sound hot 😏🤭Other than the fact that I found him very, ahem, attractive, 🤭🤭 I also really liked his character. He felt very layered and realistic, and I loved how although he was a super skilled killer, he could also be so soft. But did I mean he's a super skilled killer and a bit morally grey 😏😏 Ahhh definitely a new book boyfriend ❤❤🔥🔥I also really liked the complicated father/daughter relationship between Oraya and Vincent- it was sooo interesting. And Mische wasn't an enormous character but I loved her. The most amazing ray of sunshine. So, yeah, love these characters!! 💗💗“In any other moment, I might have wished I could freeze time there. He looked like a painting. Beautiful, but also interesting, every expanse of skin whispering of another story, another past.” Next, the writing. I'm not gonna say that Carissa Broadbent's writing is the most beautiful, poetic, lyrical writing you will ever read bc it's not. But it is so damn ENTERTAINING 🤩🤩 It hooked me from the first page and I literally couldn't stop reading. I dunno what drugs she put in this book bc i was MAJORLY addicted to it ✌On a similar, I was obsessed with the plot!! 😩😩 It was literally so fast-paced- from the first page, there was so much action and juicy drama and I was entertained for every freaking minute. I loved the pacing, loved how action-packed it was and I was just OBSESSEDDD. It was like I was drowning and this book was the only oxygen I had left. I'm not even joking.Also, the end portion???? 🤯🤯🤯 I AM IN SHOCK. There was just twist after twist and when I TELL YOU MY JAW WAS ON THE FLOOR- I just sat there gasping. I NEEEDDD the second book!! 😩😩😭😭Lastly, the romance. *grins* When I say I love fantasy books with a romance subplot, THIS is what I mean!! The romance in here was so good- I was obsessed with them as a couple! 😍😍 Raihn was literally the perfect partner- he respected and supported her, and so I was rooting for them sm. They had sm chemistry and it was SO HOT! The cave scene-- 🔥🔥 I'm gonna need an entire book of Oraya and Raihn content, please and thank you. Their relationship ended on such an interesting note, so I'm so excited to see what happens in Book 2 👀“I didn’t notice my lips had curled until his thumb moved, tracing the shape of that smile as if it was something worthy of reverence. “Are you going to kill me, Oraya?” I didn’t run. Didn’t move. Instead, I lay my palm flat against his chest. I surprised even myself when I replied, “Not tonight.” His hand slid from my face and swept a stray strand of black hair from my cheek, smoothing it to the side. But instead of withdrawing, his fingers tightened around my hair—clutching it, but not pulling, as if he was trying to convince himself to let me go and failing. “You might destroy me anyway.” ~ 🤭🤭🔥🔥Overall, this is absolutely my newest obsession 😩😩🤌🤌❤❤ You NEEEED to read this if you're looking for:✔ Vampires✔ Deadly competition ✔ An awesome romantic subplot✔ Loads of action✔ An amazing fantasy romanceThis deserves every bit of hype it's getting!!! ❤❤ I'll be counting down the days til The Ashes and the Star-Cursed King's release 👀~ BEYOND 5 stars!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Okay I am OBSESSED with this 😍😍🤭🤭 Who knew I needed a brutal vampire story in my life?! 🧛‍♂️❤ For anyone intimidated by how much hype it has, IT 👏 DESERVES 👏 IT 👏 RTC!
