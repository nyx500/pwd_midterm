(Thank you Carissa Broadbent for the review copy in exchange for an honest review)Five furious stars for the Great Carissa Broadbent (that is all I will be calling her now). For one, I am not good in expressing with words, but if you make me wanna write an essay for how much I adore your book, then there must be something you have done in the past to deserve that (not that I am of anyone importance) but you get my point. So before I get to the review, just please let me share the love and praises to the Great Carissa because her works are simply bewildering. I have not read her other series but I do have the books bought with me since my friend (like the friend you like to trash books with) went rapture with how good it was and I will be expecting nothing less from now on. Queen Carissa, I think you just dropped this ðŸ‘‘. The ending of this book just tore me. I had a sister date and now I am looking like I just lost a husband. Thank you not. If I am not so occupied with work, these 500 pages would have flew just like that and it is how good the book is. It's a crime that I have to wait for the second oneFurther RTC.
