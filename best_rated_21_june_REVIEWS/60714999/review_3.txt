not exactly an original story, but it is some seriously high-quality fantasy. i really enjoyed the writing, the characters, the world-building, the plot, and the romance. there is a really perfect balance between all of these elements - they are all fully developed and share the story well together. if it had felt more unique, it definitely would have gotten 5 stars. but the entertainment value alone is through the roof. â†  4.5 stars
