5/5⭐️This was incredible, amazing, stunning, immaculate, crazy, intense, beautiful and so so sooooo much more!! Does this book deserves its hype? YES YES IT DEFINITELY DOES!! From beginning to end no flaws were discovered! Each and every second of this book was more than worth it!! Let’s start with the premise of the story. Oraya has to take part in the Kejari, which is a deadly tournament where the winner is granted a wish of any kind, provided by Nyaxia. During these trials Oraya is struggling to survive and therefore seeks an alliance with Raihn who she more than despises and vice versa. Let me tell you… the execution of this plot was immaculate!! The tournament was freaking intense and so freaking well written!! The fighting and action scenes were so well done that you could easily follow on what’s happening! The action was definitely actioning. The romance in this book was also sooooo freaking good!! Like the tension and intensity between Oraya and Raihn was to die for!! We love a good enemies to lovers trope!! I also love that it didn’t immediately turn from enemies to lovers but that there was actual slow development between these two!! From slowly gaining one another’s trust to getting along just fine to friends who slowly open up to one another to chemistry filled lovers who’ve been pining for one another unknowingly since the beginning!! The pacing and execution of their relationship was just amazing and perfect!!Character-wise this story wasn’t lacking whatsoever!! An amazing FMC who’s smart, strong-minded, powerful, scarred and witty!! Oraya is absolutely amazing and I love her character arc and I’m so excited to see where her story will go in the second book!! I’m literally on my goddamn knees for this woman!! We also love a charming, closed-off and dark love interest!! I loved Raihn the second he was introduced and came to fall for him even more the more the story moved along!! He’s incredibly well written and with that ending… I’M SO EXCITED TO SEE WHERE BOOK TWO WILL GO WITH HIS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!! Because that ending really had me shocked to my core!! I expected anything but that and I’m so intrigued to see where the story will go!! The world building was also incredible!! I love dark and mysterious fantasy books so much! The vibe, setting and atmosphere of this book were immaculate and the magic system was very well explained and you could easily follow along. And like I already said, the ending had me on the edge of my seat and my jaw was on the freaking floor!! I��m sooooooooo freaking excited for book 2 and I’m so glad that I don’t have to wait at all to get started with it!!Overall, I just know that this series will be the next big hit on booktok, booktube and bookstagram!! And it deserves all the love and hype it gets!! This was an amazing introduction into the series and I can’t wait to continue on with it!! I highly recommend it :))Edit: To anyone who wants to buy the paperback version of this book, be prepared to have sore arms while and after reading it. Like this book is so freaking huge, thick AND heavy! It’s not even 500 pages long but is ten times heavier than some books I own with a length of almost 800 pages! My arms were literally hurting so much while reading it and still do now lmao
