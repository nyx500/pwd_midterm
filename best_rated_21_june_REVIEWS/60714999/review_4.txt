【☆】★【☆】★【☆】★【☆】★【☆】ALL THE STARS!I was immediately swept up in The Serpent and the Wings of Night. I have been lucking out with phenomenal series after phenomenal series! This was no exception. I was hoping for an epic and edge-of-your-seat adventure with romance that would make my heart beat a little faster – and that is exactly what I got.Oraya is our human FMC in a world where humans are no more than livestock. However, she refuses to be preyed upon or allow her human vulnerabilities to hinder her. 🚨 BADDIE ALERT!⬥ I couldn’t be stronger than them, so I had to be more precise. No time for mistakes.Her fight and determination make her easy to root for. Oraya was rescued as a child by the Nightborn vampire king and raised as his adopted daughter. He taught her not only to defend herself and eliminate any threat — Never trust. Never yield. Always guard your heart. But, also to take the power she so desperately wanted.  ⬥ “Do you feel unsafe here, little serpent?” … “Good. You are not safe. Not in this castle. Not in this room. You are prey in a world of predators.”⬥ “Do you want to change this world, little serpent? Then climb your cage until you are so high no one can catch you. Break its bars and make them your weapons. Nothing is sharper.”The romance between Oraya and Raihn made me melt. I loved the progression of their relationship. How patient and understanding Raihn was. His need to protect her. Oraya is just as drawn to him, but she doesn’t offer her trust easily. The banter between them had me doing all the -ing’s — swaying, sighing, panting, giggling, melting, and cherishing. I made a section below to feature some of the quotes that had me swooning.I will not discuss the Kejari tournament so you can experience it. Hopefully, it does not cause you a sleepless night as it did me. I just could not put this book down for anything. The ending has me theorizing! I have thoughts on the direction the series might be going and certain characters that are a bit of an itch I cannot reach to scratch. I need to know more! ⬥ “I hope you can find it in your heart to call me a friend,” he said, as he slipped the box into his pocket. “You may find we have more in common than you think. We’re the only ones here who know what it’s like to fight against time. Counts for a lot in this world, doesn’t it?” 𝓗𝓸𝓽 𝓣𝓪𝓴𝓮𝓼⟢ Little serpent is an accurate nickname. ⟢ Bloodborn vampires are the most terrifying vampires. And yet, the most relatable to humans.⟢ The best line throughout the book is, “there she is.”⟢ The second best line is, “Give me one honest thing.”⟢ The trials in the Kejari tournament are BRUTAL. Very much like Hunger Games. ⟢ There is only one word to describe vampire family dynamics – ruthless.⟢ The entire cast of characters — brilliant and intriguing. I need to learn everything about Jesmine.⟢ Septimus…I have my third eye on you. ⟢ Carissa Broadbent knows how to captivate and entertain…with an extremely well written high fantasy romance. 𝓢𝔀𝓸𝓸𝓷𝔂 𝓠𝓾𝓸𝓽𝓮𝓼“Give me one honest thing, Raihn Ashraj.”“I’ve lived through some injustices in the last couple of centuries. Seen some fucking travesties. But one of the biggest, Oraya, is that anyone taught you that you should become anything other than exactly what you are.”He smelled like the sky—he tasted like falling. His lips met mine like he’d been waiting his entire life for this kiss and had known exactly what he would do when he got it.“You are the most stunning thing I’ve ever seen, Oraya.”“You don’t even know, Oraya.” … “The things I’ve thought about. ‘Want’ doesn’t even fucking cover it. I have a list.”“Give me one honest thing,” he murmured.One honest thing. The most terrible honest thing of all was that with Raihn, it was all honest—it always had been. I didn’t know it was possible to feel this much. Want this much.The hint of a smile creased the corners of his eyes. “There she is.”“So don’t you fucking dare stop fighting, princess. It would break my damned heart.”His hands gripped my hips, his eyes never leaving mine. “I would beg,” he murmured. “For you, I would. You have fucking destroyed me, Oraya. Do you know that?”Overall, if you enjoyed the vampire/human romance in Twilight, the high-stakes competition in Hunger Games, and the gritty political intrigue in Game of Thrones - this IS your book. Run, friends. Don't walk. Thank you for taking the time to read this review. 🤝⋆ ⋆ ⋆ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ ⋆ ⋆ ⋆UPDATE (4/12/23): Switched back to the ebook for my reread.
