‚ÄùAfter all, vampires know better than anyone how important it is to protect their hearts. And love, understand, is sharper than any stake.‚ÄùThis is how you write a vampire story - bloody, passionate and wild. Combined with so many of the tropes we all love‚Ä¶ultra-high-stakes blood sport, an introspective badass heroine, a powerful hero with a soft heart, political scheming, hidden powers, daddy issues, ‚Äúwho did this to you?‚Äù‚Ä¶.just *chef‚Äôs kiss*And for everyone looking for that perfect enemies > lovers > enemies book - THIS IS YOUR JAM!!Nobody writes a slow burn like Carissa Broadbent. Just the tension, the angst‚Ä¶the fragile trust, that gently unfurling sense of friendship that grows into something more. By the time they actually get together you‚Äôve been holding your breath for half the book just waiting for the ‚ú®moment‚ú® - and it‚Äôs ohhhh-so-worth it. Raihn and Oraya unexpectedly find a kindred spirit in each other‚Ä¶neither of them feel completely human or completely vampire, but together they finally feel at ease. And together they beat insurmountable odds - until fate pits them against each other. Secrets will come to light, and the forces of love versus power will explosively collide. This world is fascinating, dark as hell and brimming with potential for many more books. Carissa has created a full and complex mythology to accompany these stories and I want to know all the things - about the Bloodborn and about Salinae and about all the other gods and goddesses. Everyone knows that I am the biggest Carissa Broadbent stan and I‚Äôve been waiting impatiently for this book ever since it was announced! This series is definitely a worthy follow-up to the War of Lost Hearts trilogy, and I‚Äôm already dying for the sequel (soooo much scheming - and hopefully spice - ahead üòå). ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è to Carissa for the opportunity to read this ARC and give my honest thoughts!!April 2022: SMASH that Want to Read button
