---5 'Little Serpent' ☆---  “Do you want to change this world, little serpent? Then climb your cage until you are so high no one can catch you.Break its bars and make them your weapons. Nothing issharper. I know because I did it.” I am this book, this book is me. Carissa, ma'am you will be seeing my lawyer after what you've done.  She literally took all her cunning plot twists and her beautiful writing style and her hot memorable characters and ran over my heart and my guts with it multiple times and l let her and l will let her do it over and over again because of how good this is. I need to talk to my therapist after what she did to me and my precious babies Raihn and Oraya, like why? 😭There was just so much going on literally every single page. I couldn't look away. Letting this book down to eat or sleep felt like losing a vital organ of my body (preferably my nonexistent wings 😉) Another thing that l really liked (and feel like other books should have as well) is the fact the MC's didn't only have their development as a couple but also individual development and that too with eachothers help and support. I just think we don't get to see a lot of that in books nowadays.And can we take a proper minute to fully acknowledge that ending like 😮💨 There was A LOT going on all at the same time and Carissa just expected us to deal with it??! Those ending plots seriously almost gave me a heart attack and the amount of Hindi gaali's l gave this book is seriously immaculate 💔😭🤚 Also for a minute there l thought l was gonna have to start a Raihn hate club but we're fine now I think 😭🔫‐-----------------♤♤♤-------------------~Character Rants~  I loved it—really, truly loved it—when they underestimated me.For my mother *ahem* l mean for Oraya l have no words that can properly convey how much l like her fearlessness and ✨badass-ery✨ and her character development throughout the book uffff. She really went from "I'm scared of vampires" to "Come at me bitches, let's see what you got" and l seriously- 🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️ “I would beg,” he murmured. “For you, I would. Youhave fucking destroyed me, Oraya. Do you know that?”Daddy Raihn seriously has some explaining to do after what he did to my precious, Oraya 🤧🥺 but this man 😮💨✨🤰🦋 But aside from that he is such a babygirl, softie, touch her and you die and l was honestly kicking my feet and squealing like a child at some bits. The way he was always there for her and loved her it just- 🤰🤰And also the way he would say "There she is" and l nearly feel to my knees. Also this man better GROVEL hard and fast for Oraya in the second book or else l don't want it (jkjk i do want it 🥺)  ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️** ⚠️ SPOILER ZONE. PROCEED WITH CAUTION⚠️** --- I seriously am so confused with this whole Vincent r*ped the queen and Raihn also supposedly had a child on the way with her. Like how does that work??! Imagine, your lover did "The Devils Tango" with your mother. Or maybe l missing something out here?! Cause this was really confusing. Because if I'm not missing anything this is some seriously fucked up crap💀🤚 **⚠️ END OF SPOILER ZONE ⚠️**  ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️‐-----------------♤♤♤-------------------~Favorite quotes/lines~  ♧ "...Death isn’t frightening when weighedagainst an insignificant existence.” ♧ "Do you want to change this world, little serpent?
