—5 stars—“You cannot accomplish anything in this world without power.”————about the book————Age: NAGenres: Fantasy Romance, VampiresCliffhanger: YES. (CLARISSA WHYYYYYYY)Writing: 9/10Quotes: 9/10World building: 10/10Characters: 10/10Romance: 9/10My rating: 10/10TRIGGER WARNINGS: rape, assault, grief and death, slavery, toxic relationships, etc.‼️spoilers below‼️———my thoughts———The adopted human daughter of the Nightborn vampire king, Oraya had to fight tooth and nail to survive.Her only chance to becoming something more, someone to be respected, is to enter the Kejari, a legendary tournament.But to survive, Oraya is forced to ally with the mysterious Raihn, and more terrifying than the Kejari, is her odd attraction to him...I’m in love.With the world, the characters, the writing, the romance, everything.After seeing all the 4- and 5-star reviews, I was expecting it to be good, but this was fucking incredible.I’ve been a vampire girl for a long time, but this is absolutely stunning! Definitely at least my second favourite vampire book...or higher...First of all, the world. Gorgeously brutal, vicious and ruthless, I adored it! It was so well written that I was never lost, but only happily basking in the blood and violence (ok, that sounds weird).The writing was amazing, with so much action and fight scenes, that it completely sucked me in every time I picked it up!It was so hard to stop reading, and I’m not even going to talk about THAT CLIFFHANGER!!! I’m heartbroken, and I need MORE. Omfg I cannot wait for the next book! Anyway...Morally grey characters are my weakness, and these characters definitely were!Murderous, cruel, but also caring, Oraya and Raihn have my heart forever! The banter and tension was everything to me, but also the sweet things, like the mirror scene and taking care of each other’s wounds.Oraya and Vincent’s father-daughter relationship was so sweet...you can see how much they care for each other, and it was beautiful to see.Vincent himself was such an interesting character...he had his own motives for everything he did, and what happened to him broke my heart.From the first page, I knew I would love Oraya—she reminds me of one of my favourite characters EVER—Jude Duarte! She’s got that ruthless streak and that never-feels-like-she’s-enough vibes!Raihn...what you did hurts like hell, but I still love you, of course. My Cassian look-alike (or at least that’s how I pictured him) with his wing and fangs—how could I not fall for him?The romance perfectly served me everything I wanted...allies to lovers, taking care of each other, and of course, hot scenes to die for!The betrayal in this was stunningly HEARTBREAKING. The last six chapters were just PAIN. But I’m very excited to see what happens next...———characters ———Oraya: fierce and ruthless, I adore her so much! Badass woman are always my favourite, but her especially!!!Raihn: dangerous and violent, his caring side was so nice to see...but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t love the brutal side too!Mische: sweet and sunshiny, I wish we had more of her, because she’s adorable! She reminds me of Mor a little, and I love it!Vincent: powerful and vicious, Daddy Vince can’t do anything wrong in my eyes...————quotes————“I would beg, for you, I would. You have fucking destroyed me, Oraya. Do you know that?”“There are moments in one’s life that remain permanently distilled in memory. Some wither within minutes, and others are carved forever into our souls.”“You are the most stunning thing I’ve ever seen, Oraya.”“The things I’ve thought about. ‘Want’ doesn’t even fucking cover it. I have a list”“Don’t forget those teeth of yours, little serpent. You will need them.”“Never trust. Never yield. Always guard your heart.”————songs————Monsters -RuelleTainted love -Holy warsWar of hearts -RuelleCrooked halo -Stitched up heartGame of survival -RuelleHunting grounds -In This Moment———random extra thoughts———I loved this so much—I just know I’ll be thinking about it for a long time!Also, adding “little serpent” to my list of favourite nicknames🥰🥰Thanks for reading!❤️———————————————CAN I JUST SAY THAT IM SO HAPPY I READ THIS WITH MY GIRLS, VIO AND RI??
