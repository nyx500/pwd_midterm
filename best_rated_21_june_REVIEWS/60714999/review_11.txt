"I would beg,” he murmured. “For you, I would. You have fucking destroyed me, Oraya. Do you know that?"This book was phenomenal. The story, the characters, the plot twist in the end, the trials, the romance, the magic, the world building. Everything in it was utter perfection. I literally devoured this book and there is no denying the fact that THIS SERIES AND ITS CHARACTERS ARE MY NEW OBSESSION. It has the epic romance, drama and action.I loved the fantasy world and how it has everything vampires, humans, demons, gods and goddesses. I loved every part of this book and it literally had me hooked since the very first chapter to the last one with it intense and insane storyline. The last chapters had me screaming and crying and sobbing 😭 because what was that! I NEED ANSWERS! I didn't even expected that much from this series but it delivered everthing. The top notch banter, the palpable sexual tension and angst between Raihn and Oraya, the electrifying chemistry between Raihn and Oraya, the freaking blonde Vampire- Vincent the king of Nightborn who calls his daughter "MY LITTLE SERPENT" (I'm never getting over this nickname), the deadly trials of the Kejari tournament, the epic romance of our Raihn and Oraya and their first meet where she stabbed him with her knife🤭 The plot and the world building was absolutely magical, mesmerisingly beautiful and incredible. I was totally invested in this and it was fast paced and I liked how Carissa described about the trials and the characters and everything and it didn't felt like boring or too much. It was perfect as it should be. The writing well it was perfect and exquisite.OrayaThis girl is such a badass and fierce and the way she fights those vampires and everyone who underestimated her was everything. She is clever, focused and a vicious little human girl who could kill you with her daggers. I loved her "touch me and I'll kill you" side a lot and how bravely and strongly she fought in those deadly trials. I loved her character so much and my heart hurts for what she had to go through 😭"I loved it—really, truly loved it—when they underestimated me."Raihn AshrajHave I told you that this man is perfect and I love him and even though he seems dangerous and violent but he has such a sweet and a soft side which he shows only to Miche and Oraya. I loved his protective side as much as I love seeing his brutal one. He is just perfect and everytime he says "There she is." to Oraya my heart melts 💗🫠 His character has intrigued me a lot since the starting and there's so much we have to know about him and I can't wait."I’ve lived through some injustices in the last couple of centuries. Seen some fucking travesties. But one of the biggest, Oraya, is that anyone taught you that you should become anything other than exactly what you are." VincentWell he is a morally grey vampire king who kills people and is very protective of his daughter Oraya. I loved how he protected Oraya for all these years and he made her strong and brave. He hid so many things from her and that betrayal was just too much for me. But I still feel like he deserves better and I didn't get much of his story. He may be looked like a villain to all others but he always had a soft spot for his little serpant. “Do you want to change this world, little serpent? Then climb your cage until you are so high no one can catch you. Break its bars and make them your weapons. Nothing is sharper. I know because I did it."MicheShe was a ball of sunshine and no I'm not kidding because her personality radiates this sunshine and sweetness and she's so adorable. I would love to know more about her in the upcoming books because there's definitely so much we don't know about her past and powers.—Relationships—Raihn and OrayaGod, these two are just so freaking hot and sexy and adorable at the same time. I loved their chemistry so much and how they hated each other so much in the start only to fall in love with each other later. They understand and cared for each other when they got hurt. Raihn always understood the complexity of Oraya while Oraya knew that Raihn may be a Vampire but his heart was always human. He cared so much for his loved ones. I loved the allies to lovers and the slow burn was impeccable and the moment they got together was just😩🔥 *ahem**ahem* Chapter 38 *ahem**ahem*I can't wait to read the next book and my heart is still broken from the betrayal but i just can't stop shipping them together and never will okay!? They are made for each other even if they want to kill other 💗😭"You are the most stunning thing I’ve ever seen, Oraya."“You don’t even know, Oraya. The things I’ve thought about. ‘Want’ doesn’t even fucking cover it. I have a list.”"Oraya of the Nightborn,” he murmured. “I give you my body. I give you my blood. I give you my soul. I give you my heart. From this night until the end of nights. From daybreak until our days are broken. Your soul is my soul. Your heart is my heart. Your pain is my pain. I bind myself to you.”Oraya and VincentI loved their relationship dynamic and the complexities of it. Vincent was always there for her when she needed his help and I lived for Oraya and Vincent's moments. Their father daughter relationship was not normal and he took away her humanity and always told her to protect her heart and soul in their world full of predators. I want more of them but now I just can't 😭😭💔THE ENDING 😭 It killed me and no I'm not okay. I never thought it would end like this. It broke me, betrayed me and it was heart shattering to read the last few chapters. They were brutal and painful. And Carissa Broadbent you better fix my broken heart with the second book because I don't know what I'll do. —Favourite Quotes—➸ "There are moments in one’s life that remain permanently distilled in memory. Some wither within minutes, and others are carved forever into our souls."➸ "You cannot accomplish anything in this world without power."➸ "He did not fear my darkness, nor pity my compassion.

He smelled the way air felt as it rushed around you, freeing and terrifying and the most beautiful fucking thing you’ve ever experienced."➸ "I would beg for him, too. Break for him. Cut myself open like an animal for dissection. He held me open that way, not just my body but my soul, too."My lovely besties Vio and Lyra ❤️ guys I'm so happy to read this book with you.
