An excellent finale to this section of the Mistborn series. Waxillium, Wayne and Steris are all in top form aided by Detective Marsi Colms. The book starts with a bang and then it is action all the way. The gods are very busy. Autonomy is stirring up Wax's sister to evil doings, and Harmony is less useful than usual. When things get really serious Wax is called upon to save the world, although in the end I think Wayne is the biggest hero. There are many nods to the Cosmere and even a character or two dropping by. The story becomes a race against time, and this ensures that it is hard to put the book down although the humour helps alleviate any stress. Wayne frequently reminded me of those Terry Pratchett characters who always land on their feet and his scenes with his 'accountants' were smart and funny. A series of epilogues make sure we all know what happened to everyone and all is well with the world. I was pleased to see that more books are proposed in the series but moving forward to the computer age. I am looking forward to that!
