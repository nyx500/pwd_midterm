I still want to give this one 4.5 stars but I did like Gideon a bit more so let that be known. TW: allll the blood, gore, bones, and body horror; possession; implied necrophilia sort of?? This is a necromancy book so things are complicated and weird This book is weirder than Gideon the Ninth was and if you were at all confused by that one, you are definitely going to be confused here. I was not confused in book 1 but this one I absolutely had no idea what was going on (and that is the point) until 75% into the book. But I still enjoyed the atmosphere and trusted the process because I had to know what the fuck was going on. And in some ways my questions were answered and in others not, but I continue to be impressed by the absolute originality of this series and complexity of what goes on while still being funny and weird and having a lot of heart. Iâ€™m excited for things this laid out and, like many fans of the series, cannot wait for the next one. So glad we have 2 books left! Review and discussion videos to come on my channel.
