Update: Re-read to get ready for Book 3. I loved this even more than before. The parts that confused me the first time around made sense the second time.Amazing sequel. I respect this book a lot for taking serious risks and pulling them all off. It's markedly different from the first book but also fully grounded in the larger universe of the story. And without giving anything away, there are twists that are so good and seem to be set up so early that now I want to read the first book all over again.I'm going to run out of words for how much I loved this book. It's funny, heartbreaking, riveting, and also dense with details throughout. I want to read at least the last quarter of the book again to better figure out everything that happened. Mostly I kept flying along because I was so totally wrapped up in all the necromancer drama. There were so many characters and I loved all of them.Compared to the first book, there's a change in the writing style that took me a while to get used to. And there are some revelations throughout that relied on details I missed by not reading close enough. But I have no complaints about any of that. I love a book that's so well written that it can get going at full speed and trust that I'll try my best to keep up. And the result was just amazing.Anyways, if you haven't read Gideon yet, go do that. It was my favorite book last year. Then read this. It's fantastic.(And the audiobook is just as perfect as the first book. Please can Moira Quirk do all the audiobooks?)
