this sequel is everything the first book is, just bumped up to the next level. it has the same kind of raw and gritty nature i loved about ‘the blade itself,’ and with a narrative that so expertly makes these books less about a story with characters and more about the characters’ story. the focus is not on what the characters do, but about how those things effect the them. if that makes sense.i found myself rooting for the same characters i was drawn to in the first book, but i also became a fan of new ones. there is some really excellent character development in this installment, which makes the slow plot worth it. i expect more of the same for the next and final book, so cant wait to pick it up!↠ 4 stars
