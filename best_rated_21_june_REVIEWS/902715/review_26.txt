Arguably even better than the previous instalment, Before They Are Hanged is another suspenseful, action-packed, intrigue-filled piece of entertainment. This is far from high-level literature, but it's a damn good fantasy series.Inquisitor Glokta's difficulties practically ruling a besieged city, the woes of good old West in saving a military campaign from a spectacularly incompetent commander, and our dear party of adventurers venturing forth into the ruins of the Old Empire to dig up some forgotten mysteries - all compelling stories setting up everything wonderfully for a grand finale.
