QuestThe world-building from Joe Abercrombie is outstanding, and Before They Are Hanged takes the incredible adventures from the first book to a new level. The battle scenes feel real, they are brutal, unflinching and vividly drawn, just to let you know there is a lot at stake. The sense of expanse widens as the adventures spread to the ends of the world. The array of characters is further developed, with ranging details that create a variety of personalities that gel and conflict with intriguing unpredictability.Bayaz, the First of the Magi, is leading a band of adventurers on a dangerous mission to distant lands. The most hated and deadly woman in the South, Ferro, the most feared man in the North, Logan Ninefingers, and the most selfish boy in the Union, Jezel, make a strange alliance. Their ability to inflict severe damage to opponents contrasts with their loyalty and deeply rooted sense of justice. As a band of warriors, their cohesion and diversities continue to captivate. We get to see deeper into their nature, and the subtle charisma with several is surprising.Several other characters are intriguing, including Glokta, the Inquisitor. Having to defend his city, knowing it is full of traitors that he must root out. Glokta is a fascinating character, a role that inflicts torture, yet he knows failure could mean his execution. He can trust no one, and many would like to see the end of him. As an intelligent man, he knows the precarious path he treads, and within his own complexity, he doesn't act consistently with a steady hand and a happy heart. Right and wrong cannot be attributed to one side alone.Before They Are Hanged is a fantastic fantasy adventure full of wonderfully drawn characters, a landscape that comes alive, and a ridiculously imaginative plot. I would highly recommend this book and the whole First Law trilogy.
