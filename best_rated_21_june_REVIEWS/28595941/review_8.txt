THIS is what you get when the author is not just skilled, imaginative, fun, socially cognizant and logical but a also perfectionist when it comes to keeping things organized: unlike every other series out there, Sanderson has gone that extra step to compile a thoughtful, systematic, and a very thorough collection of novellas to fill every nook and cranny between all major installments.However, calling this a compilation of ‘novellas’ is not actually accurate, for, there are more than a few of those here which could be considered to be complete books by most readers’ standards, including Emperor’s Soul and Sixth of Dusk.One of the unexpected benefits of Arcanum Unbounded was, at least for me, the clarity this brought to the overall arrangement of Cosmere. When we get in too deep with a single series, we tend to lose track of where we are and what else is there in the present system. Since this collection is categorized by different star systems, it gives us constant reminders as to what else is out there and what to expect in future.Considering the non-trivial nature of most of the contents here, I strongly recommend any who are looking forward to getting into Cosmere to grab a copy of this in advance. You’ll save yourself a lot of confusion down the line,
