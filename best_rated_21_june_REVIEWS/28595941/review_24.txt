I didn't plan to reread so many of the stories in this collection. I've read most of them and own quite a few already so I expected I would just check out the star maps, read the annotations for each system and skip on over to Edgedancer. Well, that didn't happen. It started when I decided to reread The Emperor's Soul. One thing led to another and before I knew it I couldn't stop. I underestimated the pull that Sanderson's worlds have on me. As for Edgedancer, it was the perfect story to finish up the collection. Roshar is my favorite world in Sanderson's universe, and any little bit of discovery we are able to make into that world and the coming events is very exciting. There's at least one familiar face, and the mention of another that has me wondering even more now what he could be up to. But Lift is ultimately what made it a great experience. She is such an entertaining, funny and refreshing character. She actually reminds me a little of Wayne from Mistborn. And I just love her sidekick Wyndle. I can't wait to see them again, and I'm even more excited now for the release of Oathbringer.
