My reviews for these books are getting kind of repeatative, how many ways are there to say I LOVE THIS SERIES! Not too many I think. So I have decided to do a list of what I love about this book:1. Mercy & Adam- I love that rather then them having an immediate love-you-till-you-die connection that it seems to have grown and in this book you really see how deep the bond between them is. Indivdually, especially Mercy, they are likable characters brave and honest and the more I read about them, the more I like them.2. Samuel- OMG MY POOR SAM! I love how Sam has developed from a possible love interest for Mercy to such a good friend and I can't wait to see how things pan out for him.3. The World- I was right, the Fae are DEFINITELY the creepiest and scariest of all the races that Patricia Briggs has created. Werewolves are primitive, volatile and violent, but they still have human connections and family and Pack are important to them; Vampires are creepy and cold but even they have a Seethe that they protect and they used to be human. But the Fae are ruthless, calculating and if vampires are cold some of the Fae are just glacial, Ms Briggs gives them such an air of Otherness that for me they seem the most dangerous. There are lots of other things I like about this series as well, the writing for example although nothing fancy manages to put the story across with a great deal of clarity and it really feels like you are looking through Mercy's eyes.LOVE LOVE LOVE Mercy Thompson.
