"I thought you were dead," he said..."Stupid," I said. "As if I'd die without taking you with me."He smiled faintly.Mercy has grown on me throughout this series. She still isn't as much of a smartass as I would like, but she is becoming more and more fun as time goes on. In this book, she is dealing with Samuel's issues while trying to figure out where Phin, the bookstore owner, has gone. On top of that, she has Adam's pack messing with her because some of them are not happy with her status as Adam's mate. So, there is a lot going on. And, as usual, Mercy ends up dealing with bad guys, getting hurt, going off on her own, etc..etc... And, as usual, it is all without Adam. I don't know why the author gave Mercy a boyfriend who she has to leave on the sidelines every time that Mercy does anything. I get that he is a nice guy, but the fact that he has such a short fuse, and is so over-protective would drive me crazy. I feel like the author has to make up reasons to get Adam out of the way for Mercy to go running off on an adventure without him every book because he would just take over and spoil everything. And, for Mr. Macho Pack Leader, she sure has saved his ass a lot. I'm just saying...It is nice to see Samuel have a story, but he is in wolf form for much of the book and so we don't get to have him speaking - which is a bummer. And, the bad news is that there is absolutely no Stefan in this book. :(But, Jesse is developing into a pretty good character, and so is Ben. I would like to see Ben get a storyline in the future.
