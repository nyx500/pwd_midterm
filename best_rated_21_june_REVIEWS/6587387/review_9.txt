I follow several supernatural/paranormal series, but this one is easily one of my favorites. Brigg’s does a fabulous, fabulous job of being consistent with her characters while helping them to grow and change. I am ceaselessly impressed with how she juggles all her supernatural aspects. So far she has kept everything on an even keel and has given us the information we needed without doing a chapter of info dump or disrupting the action. And the way she writes relationships is fantastic – not just the romance between Mercy and Adam, but Mercy’s other relationships as well. So many heroines are solitary, relying primarily on the hero to form who they are, but Mercy is her own person. She is complete without Adam and better with him. She has friends who care about her and friends she cares about. In other words, like a real woman, she has a lot of aspects that she juggles to make her life work. And make it work she does.
