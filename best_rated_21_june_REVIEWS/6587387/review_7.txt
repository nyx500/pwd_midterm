Re-read for the 3rd time April 14th 2020. Not a fan of Mary Jo, even though she did a lot to make up for her actions, her attitude towards Mercy doesn't really change. Re-read March 25th 2017 Can't stop my re-reading binge! ****Spoilers if you haven't read the previous books****Mercy navigates Pack dynamics and the animosity of some of the members. Being a coyote brought into a werewolf Pack doesn't make several happy, but there are a couple unhappy for another reason. Adam and Mercy's relationship strengthens in spite of some outside interference and I'm always impressed with the loyalty and love between them. Samuel's mental condition takes a turn for the worse, but Mercy is a good friend and Adam is helpful with his support. Mercy is also dragged into Fae issues, once again.Thoughts back in September 2013:So, so, so good!! Love this series! Review, maybe...
