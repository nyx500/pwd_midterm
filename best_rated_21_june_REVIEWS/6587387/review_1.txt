Patricia Briggs does not disappoint us in Silver Borne, the 5th book in her fabulous Mercy Thompson Series.We continue following Mercy’s life and the world that she lives in…trouble always follows her as she throws herself into saving or helping her friends. This story goes deeper into the secretive and dark and dangerous fae world…. Mercy has something that the fae want back – a book she had borrowed from a fae friend, who is in danger because of that. She finds herself being contacted by the Fae Queen, demanding the return of their valuable book…In between trying to find her fae friend, she another problem thrown at her by Adam’s wolf pack, who are most unhappy about her Adam making her part of his pact without their consent.  But Adam is not backing down. He’s committed to Mercy and no matter what is pack thinks, says or do…. She’s his mate and that will never change….… I love the chemistry between Adam and Mercy. Their connection is unbreakable and I like seeing their relationship grow instead of having that insta-love thing.  The world building and the characters are so well developed that makes it so real and believable.I just love this series.My favorite quote:
