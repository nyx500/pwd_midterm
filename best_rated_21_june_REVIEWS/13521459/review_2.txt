Red Country (First Law World,#6)by Joe AbercrombieDarkness, brutality, and tragedy. This book has full of violence, tension, and dark humor as expected by the author. But more than that, it's a good standalone book and much better than the previous standalone book(The Heroes) which I feel the weakest among the author's previous stand-alone books. Enjoyed the tale in this book.Strange, how the best moments of our lives we scarcely notice except in looking back.Good story.
