This book was good. In fact it was very,very good. I loved Abercrombie's The First Law Trilogy so much and it was a delight to see the return of a few of his strongest characters from those books. Plus there were a few new characters who managed to steal the show. Joe Abercrombie is without doubt a very talented author. His characters are always so flawed and yet still so appealing, his stories are full of grossness and violence yet are still so very readable and his handling of the English language is impeccable. Perfect. More please Mr Abercrombie. I need to know what happens to all these wonderful people. Especially Lamb.....and Temple.....and Shy......and everyone!
