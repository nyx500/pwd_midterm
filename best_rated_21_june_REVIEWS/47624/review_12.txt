[4 Stars] I'm conflicted about this rating because the first half of the book was probably more like a 5 star book, the last half of the book was more 4 stars, and all of Sameth's parts were around 3.5 or even 3 stars. Why did Sameth have to be just as annoying as Lirael was amazing? Lirael was seriously such a fantastic protagonist, and I wish the book had focused almost entirely on her as opposed to bringing Sameth into the picture. He just seems like a bit of a waste in all honesty: annoying, spoiled, stupid, and obnoxious. If Sameth hadn't bugged me so much, I would have given this book a 4.5 or even a 5 star rating, but as it stands now I can only really give it a 4. I also felt that things significantly slowed down towards the end, and I just wanted it all to be finished. I think part of the reason for this is that I'm not convinced Garth Nix can write villains I really love or love to hate or can just get behind, you know? They all seem a little meh to me. That being said, I do want to emphasize that Lirael and the Disreputable Dog are AMAZING, and their portions in the book, everything about the Clayr and the Library, and just gah all the portions with Lirael were 5 stars for sure. The rest of the book I just wasn't as convinced about. I think this is also due in part to this being more of a part one to the story and Abhorsen being part two of the story. Regardless, I really enjoyed this and can't wait to jump into Abhorsen!
