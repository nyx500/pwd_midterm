It took me a while to get around to reading this book, even though I rushed out and bought it immediately after finishing Sabriel. The up side to that is in the meantime, I'd bought Abhorsen as well. That's important. Sabriel was a good stand-alone novel. Lirael and Abhorsen are not. In fact, I'd recommend that before you read Lirael 1) you read Sabriel first and 2) you have a copy of Abhorsen ready to pick up as soon as you finish Lirael. Lirael ends in the middle of something, and the two probably could have been combined into one very long novel.Still, I recommend the whole series. The characters may not be quite as awesome as Sabriel, but they're still very well-done and the story is wonderful. I'll definitely seek out more of Garth Nix's books after I finish this series.
