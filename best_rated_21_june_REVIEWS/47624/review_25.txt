Narrated by Tim Curry. Yo can stop here, you need no more information than that, to desire this audiobook.Or, maybe you do. Second in the Abhorsen series, this is actually pretty distinct from the first book (Sabriel), so you could start here with only a little catch-up work to do. But you cannot stop here, as this volume ends in a minor cliffhanger and is continued i Abhorsen.Although nominally a YA book, the characters are very compelling, the plot and themes slightly complex, and the vocabulary rich, so that it read well for this OA.Of course, there's Tim Curry, too.
