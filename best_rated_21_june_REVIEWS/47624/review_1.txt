“When the Dead do walk, seek water’s run, for this the Dead will always shun. Swift river’s best or broadest lake to ward the Dead and haven make. If water fails thee, fire’s thy friend; if neither guards, it will be thy end.” Well this was freaking awesome!As a sequel where the main character from Book 1 isn’t the main focus - I was a bit worried; but there was no need because Lirael continued the story of the Old Kingdom and the dead fantastically! “The blue hats shaded silver sightless eye sockets, the blue scarves held together rotting heads.” Lirael is part of the Clayr - those who can see into the future. But Lirael has never received the Sight. As she gets older and the Sight still doesn’t appear, her self worth becomes non existent and she retreats into herself.  “lunging forward and nipping her quite sharply on the leg...”what did you do that for?” “You were being pathetic,” said the Dog.” Lirael is so relatable! Hiding out in the library to avoid speaking to anyone, her isolation from the Clayr is palpable and you really feel for her.  “I’m not sure I can believe what I’m seeing.” “You’d better believe it...because they’ll kill you whether you believe in them or not.” Meanwhile, Prince Sameth - the son of Sabriel and King Touchstone is due to take on his role as the Abhorsen in Waiting to eventually take over from his mother. But he is terrified - after a hairy situation facing a Necromancer in Death, Sam can think of nothing worse than a life fighting the creatures of the dead.  “You may not See, but you will Remember. And in the Remembering, you will see the hidden past that holds the secrets of the future,” Lirael is eventually sent on a mission by the Clayr and meets Sam while he is on the run. This leads to many adventures and some serious twists at the end! The writing is witty, action packed and magical!Overall a non stop thrill ride and I can’t wait to read the next one!  “I suppose we’ll end up having to swim for our miserable lives.”
