Audiobook/sync/ebookVoice narrator Kim Staunton was outstanding....Absolutely fantastic! At times I felt like I was watching a movie.... and Staunton had a lot to do with the ‘movie-feeling’ experience. She demanded my attention- I even stood taller while soaking in our warm water pool. The time travel/fantasy/historical fiction blend worked beautifully... kept me interested. Dana Franklin is a strong protagonist - a black woman married to a white man during the 70’s. Each time she is thrown back in time she has to grapple with the devastation-slavery-era - vs. remembering who she is: a free woman/born free.Oh my - the children and messages in this book are priceless. The creative crafty storytelling, .....with so much -WRONGNESS - INJUSTICE & DISPARITY had me thinking - as in ‘living’ -in both- the past and present world. This was my first book by Octavia Butler....( sad to know she is no longer alive)...What a beautiful passionate writer she was.I’ve own this book for years ... It was seeing the movie - “Just Mercy” recently- adapted from the incredible book by Bryan Stevenson -And....connecting with author *Hana Ali*, whom I had the privilege of sharing with recently as well....who told me ‘Kim Staunton’...(voice narrator of ‘her’ memoir): “At Home with Muhammad Ali”. ( a book I’ve not read ‘yet’ but look forward to).....that inspired me to choose “Kindred”....To experience both Octavia & Kim I certainly waited long enough to read this ‘classic’( ?/!), book. and......SO MUCH BETTER than I expected. (as I often tend to shy away from words like sci-fi, fantasy, and time travel)...But honestly>> there was absolutely nothing to worry about - I would’ve missed a wonderful story and introduction to an author I had not read. Blessings & Thanks...to all the readers of this book who came before me.
