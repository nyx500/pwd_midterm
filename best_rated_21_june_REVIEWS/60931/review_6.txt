Octavia Butler amazes me. She writes science fiction that is full of complicated ideas about race and sexuality that are completely readable. I’ll innocently start reading, thinking only to get a solid start on the book, and suddenly discover I’m halfway through the story. That isn’t to imply she’s a light-weight, however; her works are emotionally and ethically dense, the subject of numerous high school and college essays. A recent read of Dawn inspired a number of recommendations for Butler and a buddy read of her book Kindred. *************Full reviews at my blog: http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2014/0...Why? Because 1) gramazon can't have my reviews, 2) because I don't feel like being censored according to some twit's whims.
