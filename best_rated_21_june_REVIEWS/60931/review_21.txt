Before Colson Whitehead's  The Underground Railroad, there was  Kindred, a grueling plunge into American slavery with a fantastic twist. One of the great time travel novels, right there with  Time and Again and  11/22/63. Aspects of the narrative might be too agonizing for the tender at heart, but I was with it all the way, from first sentence to last.
