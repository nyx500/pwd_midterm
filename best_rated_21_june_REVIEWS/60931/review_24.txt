Kindred is a hybrid novel, difficult to categorize. Partly science-fiction, partly historical novel, it addresses race, gender and class issues in the context of slavery but, and this is the complexity of this book, in two timelines, antebellum Maryland and modern California. Butler, far from trying to make sense of time travel and how it suddenly affects the protagonist of the story, uses the sci-fi device to transport a free Afro-American woman to a colonial plantation near Baltimore to explore human resilience when confronted with the vexation, humiliation and manifold forms of abuse, physical and psychological, of treating human beings as property to be used, misused and trafficked with.I wasn’t overly enthusiastic about the time travel episodes but I will confess I was instantly pulled into the story. Dana, the narrator, and maybe even the author’s alter ego, challenges the reader to get to grips with the cruel reality of slaves, of their everyday life and their will to survive mainly with the sole idea of protecting their endangered families from the masters’ whims and vicious “rights”. The artifice of time travel serves the purpose of making historical barbarity a tangible and constant threat and to better understand the huge amount of silent courage required of those oppressed to endure all sorts of inhuman punishments. Butler’s prose is rather unadorned and definitely plot-driven, but she is very accurate in recreating the social mechanisms that enabled slavery in the Southern States; the violence, the helplessness and the loss of whatever self-dignity might be left to those born into captivity. The effects of racial bigotry and subjugation on the making of identity are clearly delineated and open a debate on the reader’s mind. Progress has been made since the days of legal enslavement, of course, but is it enough? Books like this one remind us that we should never lose that silent courage, that will to survive in order to fight injustice and oppression, if only, to pay back the huge sacrifices that our ancestors made so that we could exist, so that we could be here, living a relatively comfortable life, now, today, and hopefully, a life that will be fairer when our children fight their own battles in the future.
