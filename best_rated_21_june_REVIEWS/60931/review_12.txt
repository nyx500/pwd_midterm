This took me a week to finish, but that's a compliment.It's a brutal and grueling read, and it takes ages to get through because it should, but I appreciated every minute even still.I found this to be really unflinching and realistic in its depiction of slavery and what people are like, even those white people who are just "cogs in the machine" of slavery, even when the plot or a feel-good moment would have benefited from a break from that, which is an achievement (and I imagine something that the author would have had to fight for, considering the status quo of most slavery novels and films).I thought this was primarily an exploration of humanity - or at least that's what I got from it - but the sci-fi elements, the interracial relationship study, the theme of time's impact and lack of impact...All of it hit.A one of a kind book, really! Bottom line: I have to read more Octavia Butler for sure.-----------------currently-reading updatesdoing my homework (assigning myself classic books because i miss being in school)-----------------reading books by Black authors for Black History Month!book 1: castebook 2: business not as usualbook 3: the color purplebook 4: the parking lot attendantbook 5: kindred
