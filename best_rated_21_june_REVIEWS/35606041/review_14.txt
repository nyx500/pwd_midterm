“A Little Hatred” is a stupendous bawdy gritty violent grimdark fantasy. Everything you know you want in a swordplaying industrial fantasy. Abercrombie has created a complex multi-faceted world that was developed in six previous books, the First Law trilogy and three additional novels. Be brave and step inside this world even if you are unfamiliar-with the earlier novels. There is no reason not to begin this new trilogy with A Little Hatred. The downside is that even after 500 or so pages you will want so much more. The world here is half sword and axe battles ala Braveheart, but still a burgeoning industrial world in the major city with smokestacks, child labor, and violent union organizing. There is very little magic except for a seer who can sometimes see the future but it comes in epileptic fits. Accept the slight incongruity cause it works. For Abercrombie, the fights are not just on the battlefield although the battles are wonderfully set out and the duels to the death are terrific. The struggles include palace intrigue, business maneuvers, and more. So battle exists on several different levels.Like many modern novels, Abercrombie tells his story through six or seven alternating points of view. This can be frustrating because as soon as you want to desperately know how Rilke is faring as she flees through the countryside teeming with enemies, but you are whisked into the city where Savine is involved in her sophisticated maneuvers. All thoughout it’s grim, dark, violent, and bawdy. These characters, both men and women, are lustful at opportune and inopportune times. Once you get going with this one, you’ll find it impossible to put down.
