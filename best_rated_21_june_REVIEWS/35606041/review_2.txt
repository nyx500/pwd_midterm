Check out my new youtube channel where I show my instant reactions to reading fantasy books seconds after I finish the book.An absolutely fantastic book that starts this new series off with a bang I was a little skeptical going into this book. Not only did I think the three standalone books were a lower quality than the original trilogy, but I’ve never been a big fan of books that jump time to start a new series in a previously explored world. It usually feels needless to me, and I typically wish the author would just move on to a new series than rehash something old.Oh do I love it when I’m wrong. This book was every bit as good as the original series, and potentially even better. From the first chapter to the last, this book had me mesmerized and ravenous to read more.A Little Hatred is more character driven/focused than the previous books, and has a heavy dosage of political machinations that I absolutely love in fantasy books when done right. The inner monologues of these characters make them really come to life, and the spins that this story took were both unpredictable and fantastic. While you shouldn’t read this book before reading all the books that led up to this (yes, including the standalones), this book is starting this new series off in an amazing fashion, and I desperately hope the follow up books continue the brilliance of this one. If you loved the original trilogy, I virtually guarantee you will love this one just as much.
