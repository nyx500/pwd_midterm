A Little Hatred would be a remarkable book in ANY genre. Fantasy fans are beyond fortunate that Joe chose this one.Abercrombie returns to the world of The First Law without missing a beat, displaying the same incredible empathy, evocative prose, and intensely relatable characters, all navigating one of the most intricate and well-constructed plot mazes Iâ€™ve ever had the pleasure to navigate.Seriously. This book is so good, it makes me want to give up writing. That is the highest compliment I can pay a work, and I reserve it for writers operating at the level of a James Clavell. Joe has earned his place among the masters who transcend genre, and I sincerely hope the wider literary community honors him in the same manner as it has fantasy novelists like Tolkien, Lewis, or Martin.
