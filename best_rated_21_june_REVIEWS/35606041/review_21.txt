i must say i love Savine the girlboss, Prince Orso the ultimate malewife, Rikke the psychic, and Leo dan Brock who clearly loves cock but is too suppressed to realize itOkay but on a more serious note this was bloody brilliant in every way, the character work in this was genius, the relationships between these people, the plot’s twists and turns, and even thematically it was very compelling. It was all so fascinating and Prince Orso is my fave. Can’t wait to read more of this series
