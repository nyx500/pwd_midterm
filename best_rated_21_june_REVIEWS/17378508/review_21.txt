"Queens and KingsKings and QueensBlue lily, lily blueCrowns and birds Swords and thingsBlue lily, lily blue"I just bought about 16 books last week but they all can wait. I'm going to re-read this baby first! You know why? Because Ronan freaking Lynch, and Adam Parrish live in this. <3“Behind him, he heard Ronan say, "I like the way you losers thought Instagram before first aid. Fuck off.” I love this quote! It's just so... Ronan!Ronan:“I know when I'm awake and when I'm asleep,"Adam:"Do you?"Ronan:" Maybe I dreamt you." Adam: "Thanks for the straight teeth, then,"No fictional character should have this kind of power over anyone! This was a perfect book to get over ToG series. Adam Parrish and Ronan Lynch are my new obsession! Ronan keeps joking he dreamt Adam i really hope it's not true, not that it matters. I loved them individually in previous books but together they are incomparable. Nothing is conformed or official yet... but then that is the beauty of their relationship, it's nobody else's business but theirs.“Ronan Lynch lived with every sort of secret."“Ronan was angry,every one of his emotions that wasn't happiness was anger.”“Ronan's second secret was Adam Parrish.”“Sometimes Ronan thought Adam was so used to the right way being painful that he doubted any path that didn’t come with agony.”“Adam felt Ronan’s eyes glance off him and away. Adam wondered if anyone else noticed. Part of him wished they did and immediately felt bad, because it was vanity, really:See, Adam Parrish is wantable, worthy of a crush, not just by anyone, someone like Ronan, who could want Gansey or anyone else and chose Adam for his hungry eyes.”
