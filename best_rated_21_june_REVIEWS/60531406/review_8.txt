There's no denying that Brandon Sanderson is a master storyteller, and this cute and whimsical novel was a joy to read. This story is about Tress who has never left her home island until the man she loves needs to be saved. That is the first reason I enjoyed this book: Tress's courage and character development. On her dangerous journey across different seas to save Charlie, she meets a cast of the most amazing characters. That brings us to the second reason: Each character was uniquely written, entertaining, and added to the found family element of this story. The narrator plays an active part, too, which I really enjoyed and added so much humour with his use of similes. It felt like being read to by a sassy and witty friend with a love for odd comparisons (I won't add any quotes because it's so much better to be taken by surprise like I was). The action scenes were fun, and the last few chapters moved so quickly that I was left trying to catch my breath while hoping my beloved characters would be okay. Last, but not least, this story is filled with pretty inspiring quotes that'll make you think about the way you see the world, art, work, and change. I'll end this review here, because I don't want to give away too much of the magic that's within the book's pages. This was a delightful first installment in Sanderson's 'secret project' novels, and I am looking forward to the next one.
