The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi is an action-packed pirate fantasy with an endearing cast of unlikely characters. Shannon Chakraborty's writing is strong and engaging as she weaves fantasy and history together to create a rich and unique world. I was immediately intrigued by the unique narrative style of this story. The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi is written as if it is a story that is being told to the reader. This unique style leads to some incredible foreshadowing and hilarious asides. The characters are easily my favorite part of this book. Amina al-Sirafi is a badass pirate mom who is fed up with all of the magical bullshit in her world. Having left her pirate life behind she is both terrified and thrilled when she is roped into "one last adventure." I adore every single member of her crew. Though this is the first time we have met these characters, you can feel the history and connections that bond them together. Their banter was both heartwarming and hilarious. My favorite character was, to no one's surprise, the beautifully useless himbo chaos demon Rashk. This first installment delivers a complete and fulfilling story while also setting up the plot perfectly for future books in the series. The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi is easily the best book that I have read this year. Thank you Harper Collins for the finished copy!Links to my TikTok | Instagram
