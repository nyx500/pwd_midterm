9.25/10I going to sign in as a crew member on a ship, the nakhudha is Amina al-Sirafi, a free-love Muslim, a smuggler, a pirate. We are going on an adventure, sailing the unknown land, facing the sea beasts.People say Captain Amina al-Sirafi is too relentless, too ambitious, too violent, utterly inappropriate and her last husband was a demon, oh, I love to believe all!Amina al-Sirafi is retired now cause she has a daughter, Marjana. But for the sake of Asif's mother, one of her late crew (Amina feels guilty about Asif's loss), she decided to save her grandchild, Dunya. Well, I think the right words are "threat" and "forced" instead of "sake" and "decided".As Amina and I can't do this dangerous mission on our own, we go for two of her old ones, Dalila, the Mistress of Poisons and Tinbu who fucked up and jailed, (poof, we have a rescue mission too)!They used to joke that Amina could kill you up close, Tinbu could kill you from another ship, and Dalila could kill you from a different city three days later.We have a ship’s cat that does not actually hunt mice, we will be hunted by Franks (Western and central Europian during the Early Middle Ages), become the treasure hunter for a bunch of magical birdmen and will have many other awesome sea adventures!And now, don't worry, I take an appointment in rehab for myself, but honestly, this was a very sweet dream!Many thanks to HarperCollins UK via NetGalley for helping me to completely lost the little sanity that was left for me! I presented my true feelings and love for my crew partners, and try my best to learn much more from my dearest Dalila!“God did not mean all dreams to be chased. Sometimes people must hide their hearts to survive, to honor their family.”“God made us who we are,” I said softly. “I have to believe we are to find wisdom in that.”"There was and was not a nakhudha named Amina al-Sirafi who sailed with a cunning crew all over the great Indian Ocean, dashing after magical treasures and talismans, outwitting cruel sorcerers, and battling incomprehensibly powerful creatures from legend. This is her story first, and only one of her many adventures."Where are other adventures?? I already sign in, don't forget to take me with you!
