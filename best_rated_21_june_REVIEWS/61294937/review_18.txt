i love that this is a fantasy novel that centers a sex-positive devout muslim woman in control of her own story. i don’t love that this is written like YA when it is marketed as adult.i did not enjoy the banter between the scribe and amina and felt it was distracting, unnecessary, and weak. raksh is written exactly like a shitty acotar character (demon/fae dashing demented deceitful man). the characters all felt really one dimensional, especially marjana. it’s one thing to be a dutiful daughter, it’s another to not have any personality outside of that. this novel tries so hard to be quirky and funny, and it’s just not. the longer i read, the more exhausted i felt by the base attempts at comedy. i expected a dark, gritty story rich with detail; instead i got a book that is definitely, unequivocally YA.
