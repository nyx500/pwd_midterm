4.5/5I HAVE A LOT OF FEELINGS DON'T TOUCH ME RIGHT NOW.I really really loved this book. The character interactions were ON POINT as always. I love this cast of characters so so much and I care SO MUCH ABOUT THEM. World building - YAS. I loved reading about Luna and picturing everything, especially the throne roomI can't really totally give it a 5 stars because it just felt so long and like so many things happened at the beginning that there wasn't really a climax - that being said, it was really exciting basically all the time. SO MANY THINGS HAPPENED SO MANY.I loved the ending and I could totally do with more books just because I want MORE but it was a very satisfying ending. STILL SO MANY FEELINGS.
