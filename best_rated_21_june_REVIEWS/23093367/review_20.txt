This was by far the most entertaining volume yet! I'm forever impressed by the art in Saga and the creativity that comes with inventing such unique characters.“A lot of people who came into my family's life looking like heroes ended up acting more like villains.”In Volume 4, Marko and Alana find themselves struggling with more mundane issues than they would typically come across. As Hazel grows into a toddler, Alana is forced to find a steady source of income while Marko takes care of their daughter. Their relationship is put under immense pressure, leaving the pairing on the verge of parting ways.I found the in-depth exploration of Marko and Alana’s relationship a really great addition to the overall development of this series. Though there wasn’t as much hardcore action as in previous volumes, it was a delight to focus more on the characters I’ve grown to love.Varying perspectives like Gwendolyn and robot prince IV add a vibrant flare unique to this graphic novel series. The new creatures and alien races introduced each volume are continuously impressive! I really loved this instalment!
