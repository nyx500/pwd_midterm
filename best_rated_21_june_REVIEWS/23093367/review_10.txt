This review contains *spoilers*.I loved how close the family was at the beginning. Alana and Marko were so sweet with Hazel.They had this super adorable scene and then this happensThat one sentence made me tear up.I’m so shocked with what went down in this volume. I honestly can’t believe Marko and Alana were split up at the end. I care for the two of them together so,so much. My heart hurts for everything they’re going through. Hazel summed up my feelings pretty well “I guess I’m not sure what to say about that. Words are harder than they used to be.”But I loved that we got to focus a little more on the family part in this story.And I still stand by my point that Gwendolyn is so damn badass.Also are they teaming up now??Because I need Marko and Alana to reunite right now.This review and more can be found on my blog.
