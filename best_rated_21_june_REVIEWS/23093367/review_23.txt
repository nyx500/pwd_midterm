My fangirl timeline:First there was Scully and Mulder (the truth is out there).Then came Sam and Dean Winchester (saving people, hunting things, the family business).Recently there's been Elizabeth and Philip (Married Russian spies not to be confused with Royals)Now keeping company with all of these is Alana and Marko. Star-crossed lovers from the warring planets of Wreath and Landfall. Horns and wings aside, their love is universal and instantly recognizable. All they want is peace, to be left alone to raise their precious daughter. But their enemies are many and threats lurk around every corner, from the seemingly innocent ballet teacher to Alana's Open Circuit coworker with her infinite supply of drugs. Then there are the mercenaries, Robot insurgents, and interplanetary revolutionaries who want to make the denizens of Wreath and Landfall pay for unleashing such a brutal and unceasing bloody war upon them all.So much love for this series it's turned me into bonafide fangirl stupid.
