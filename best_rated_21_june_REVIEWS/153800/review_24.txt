This series is one of my favorites by Tamora Pierce. I think Kel is her first REAL heroine. Kel doesn't have any magic powers and she's not some tool of the gods. You can see how hard she works and when she fights the Big Bad and when she does, it's all the more satisfying because she does it by herself with all her friends.I love the character interactions and the new characters. I love the end scene. Also, while I usually love Tamora Pierce's character romances, I find it interesting that  Kel didn't end up with a match at the end of the series, although one is implied. I am eager to see more of these characters. Overall this is a great book and a very satisfying end to a great series.
