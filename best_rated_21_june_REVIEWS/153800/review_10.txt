This book was pretty unputdownable; pretty action packed from beginning to end. Thinking back, there actually wasn't that much action at the beginning per se, but there's a sort of divine prophecy that starts to book off, so even when not much is happening there's still this level of expectation. I had so much empathy for Kel and everyone around her throughout the story (Jeez, why is no one sending her backup when she's got hundreds of civilians to defend and weekly raids from the enemy??) The little spurts of action left me nettled and on edge for all the characters.Kel is definitely a kick-ass fighter and strategist, but she's kind of dense to how other people are going to react/respond. Kind of a standing trait for heroes, though; I feel like I'm in a constant eye roll in regards to heroes have the "no, I'm the only one who can be risking life and future; go home the rest of you" argument over and over again. But of all of Ms. Pierces main characters, she's the one I'm most curious about for what the rest of her life is going to bring. She's the only one so far without a firm romantic interest developing by the end of her books (which was also kind of refreshing; because what are the odds that you'd be sent away from everyone you know, focused on heroics and war, and still have time to fall for someone new?), and we didn't get a whole lot of epilogue for her.ETA: On rereading I realized actually how violent this book is. Not that Ms. Pierce ever dwells on the details, but it is a book about war in an age of swords and battle axes and they're fighting against monsters. There are a lot of deaths in this book and they aren't drifting away in their sleep. I think watching Game of Thrones has maybe added some new entries to my mental image bank to pull from or something, but all the deaths in this book struck me as far more gruesome than they did on first reading. And Kel now suddenly reminds me of Brienne of Tarth.
