Overall Rating : A"It is your time, Keladry of Mindelan, Protector of the Small."I think what I love most about this series is that Kel is the definition of normal girl becoming something greater. No magical gifts, no blessing by the God's to boost her up, no talisman to grant her abilities. She pulled herself up on her own to become what she wanted to be - a Knight of the Realm. Everything about her that made her unique, was because she never gave up on herself.With her friends beside her and her unwavering resolve for what's right, she accomplished what she set out to do : protect those that need it. Tamora Pierce created a beautiful way to show that just because you aren't societies view of special, doesn't mean your aren't special at all.
