Lady Knight is a good end for this quartet. We get to see Kel and her ridiculously intelligent animal companions (so intelligent, in fact, that I started wondering why the humans were even necessary), taking on an usual task for her first assignment as a knight - commander of a refugee camp. On top of this, she's also worried about the task that the Chamber of the Ordeal told her about at the end of the previous book, tracking down a piece of pond scum using the spirits of children to animate killing machines. Kel proves herself up to the task of commander, even though she often feels she has no idea what she's doing. Her strong moral code and sense of empathy helps her win over the people of Haven and when the crap hits the fan, as it does, her friends rally around her. It's nothing spectacular at this point in the series. There are no last-minute surprises and the main showdown was over just a little too quickly thanks to those plot-convenient gryphon feathers Kel has. But I did like that for once, our MC doesn't have a great love interest in this book and doesn't end up married, engaged or otherwise heading off to an HEA at the tender age of 18. She got her life ahead of her and her knightly duties to keep her busy and satisfied, and that more than anything else is why I'm giving this four stars. Girls need to know that romance doesn't fix everything and doesn't even need to be pursued as a life goal if that's not where they see their lives headed.
