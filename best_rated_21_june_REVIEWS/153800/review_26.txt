The first half of this book was endless rounds of “refugees come in to Haven, they complain to Kel, Kel has to settle them.” A lot of admin. The second half picked up the pace. Kel continued to develop in this book, but I wish she’d delegated a bit more. A lot of it was her close POV and her getting involved in everything. I sort of got the sense of a prodigy. Not quite, because she clearly struggled, but I wish she’d seen that, say, other people were better at solving disputes, or that she’d picked up the habit of praying for the dead from another culture or another person rather than the narrative having to point out that she was the only person who prayed.
