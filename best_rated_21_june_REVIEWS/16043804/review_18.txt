The best Riyria story yet!Michael J Sullivan's storytelling ability just gets better with each book. Compared with his first self published novella The Crown Conspiracy which begins his six (now three) part Riyria Revelations, this is just better again. I really loved being back in this world. I loved being back with Royce and Hadrian. I loved being back with audio narrator Tim GeraRd Reynolds. Over the course of The Riyria Revelations we got little snippets and references of the story that became a legend across all Avryn. Theatre troupes all over the land performed plays of two thieves who climbed The Crown Tower, to rob the Nyphron church right under the Patriarchs nose. This is that story. This is where Riyria began. This is where Royce and Hadrian meet. This is the genesis of the bromance that has delighted fans of sword and sorcery fantasy world over. If you loved The Riyria Revelations then you are in for a treat because this is more of the same - only better.5 stars
