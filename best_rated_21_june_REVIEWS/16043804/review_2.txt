UPDATE: In Audible US sale 12/26/18That was so good! Getting to read how my loves, Hadrian and Royce, met was so wonderful! I love them so much and it was just a wonderful treat to read their beginnings together. I also loved reading about how Gwen got her start but it was sad and brutal, but she did it. =) This is a happy, sad, funny book! And Pickles.... let me just give an excerpt for Pickles "I already know. I don't need an ignorant peasant boy to confirm my education. I also don't need your filthy presence at my table. Take your stolen pie and your Pickle and eat outside where you belong. You miserable-"All Hadrian saw was Pickle's pie slam into Angdon's face. The plate fell away, taking the lower crust with it. The rest hung on the boy's cheeks for a second. The incident would have been hilarious if the pie hadn't been piping hot. Angdon screamed, clawing the pie from his face. Across from Angdon, Pickle's face was also red. He was up on his feet, his hand clenched into fists, and Hadrian wondered if the boy was about to leap the table after the wailing baron's son.I so loved Pickles. He was a good little dude! I love, love, love these books so much. Hadrian and Royce will always be in my heart â™¥ now, on to the next . . . .
