Well, this trilogy was depressing.Out of the three trilogies I've read in RotE so far, The Tawny Man is unfortunately my least favourite. That is not to say it is bad - I loved this trilogy. The prose, the characters (love you Fool ❤️) and the worldbuilding is still some of the best I've come across!However, the pain Fitz goes through is almost unbearable at times. I have no idea how Fitz is able to go on. I am glad the series had a bit of an happy ending though!Also this series (especially book 2) was crazy slowpaced.Nonetheless, a brilliant series which I can't recommend highly enough! 4/5
