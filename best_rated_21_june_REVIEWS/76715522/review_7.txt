I tried to write something longer but I believe that only one word is enough so: - To this series which made me dream and live in a world of magic, friendship, love and sacrifices - To Dorian, Aelin, Chaol, Manon, Rowan and every single character that made me laugh, cry and fangirl feel with them - To everything Sarah J. Mass has done for us, no matter how frustrating it turned out to be or how we didnâ€™t agree sometimes with itTHANK YOU to this series which will stay forever in my heart <3I'm going to miss you guys
