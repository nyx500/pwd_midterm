4 stars 🌟 💖 ❄️ “Who are you? ‘I am a witch. I have plucked snowdrops at Midwinter, died at my own choosing, and wept for a nightingale. Now I am beyond prophecy.”  This is such a magical and wintry trilogy. There is a war coming, between both natural and supernatural enemies and of course Vasya finds herself in the middle. I sometimes found it hard with the numerous names that can be used for the same person, and I’m also not big on the romance between her and the Winter King but I love the magical creatures and the plot so that wins overall.  “They hurt you. They beat you, spat on you, put you in the fire. Men will suck all the wildness out of the world, until there is no place for a witch-girl to hide. They will burn you and all your kind.”  Also really enjoyed the church vs local belief systems and how the whole arc was dealt with.  the fact that neither have to give up their beliefs and both agree to live alongside one another. That the Christian faith is respected as are those who have their more ancient beliefs A+ from me. Love that!  I also loved  that Soloveney (probably. Definitely spelt wrong) is brought back at the end. I cried.  Overall, a tale that sucks you in and covers you in snow and magic.  ““Run into the dark, and be brave.”   “Love is for those who know the griefs of time, for it goes hand in hand with loss.”  *******************First book Christmas present of 2019 💝 Can’t wait to finish this trilogy
