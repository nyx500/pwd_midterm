I realize it's only January, but I predict this will be one of my favorite books I read this year. This trilogy, what can I say about it without spoiling anything for those who have not read it yet? Well, if you took some Russian history and folklore, some historical misogyny and religious zealotry, a fantastic heroine, two very interesting sets of twins, some romance, some family drama, death, chaos, and redemption - you would get this series. It will be like nothing you have read before (well, for us non-Russian readers anyways) and you will (hopefully) love it. I think each book gets even better as this series goes along, so even if you are a little on the fence after book 1, still give book 2 a try. This series is going on my beloved favorite series shelf.
