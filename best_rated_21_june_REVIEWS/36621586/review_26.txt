“I have been running through the dark, trying to save all who have need of me. I have done good and I have done evil, but I am neither. I am only myself.”The Winter of the Witch starts off directly after the events of The Girl in the Tower. The pace is faster than it’s predecessors but just as mesmerising. If you’ve read my reviews of book 1 and 2, you already know my thoughts on the writing. But just in case you need a reminder: IT. IS. PHENOMENAL.Magical and mesmerising. I honesty can’t even put into words how obsessed I am with her style.So many things happen in this one and Arden really imparted it spectacularly. With everything going on in the plot, it never felt overwhelming.The setting of this one included not just Russia but also a magical midnight land.She just…. She just keeps blowing me away with her creative genius. I cant even dealThe character growth was top notch. I didn’t think my admiration for Vasya could grow, but it did. This girl went through SO MUCH during this book alone, she’s truly a hero of the ages.Morozko, Sasha and Marya are as beloved to me as Vasya is.New characters were introduced (I love you Deb Grib 😭❤) and old characters made a comeback. Arden really deserves props for reintroducing old villains in a way that did not feel recycled and lazy.The ending tore me to pieces. I was so distraught, I might have glared at my book for a good 20 minutes before finishing those last few pages.This series is perfection from start to finish. And even though it breaks my heart to say goodbye to these characters, I am already anticipating the next time I’ll pick it up again. I know it will be just as good as the first time Arden’s words drew me into med evil Russia.Buddy read with she who also loves morozko
