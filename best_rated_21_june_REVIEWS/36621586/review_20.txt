1-12-19 So I’ve sung this trilogy’s praises since THE BEAR AND THE NIGHTINGALE and I will continue to declare my love for these books. Where do I start? I was bawling my eyes out in the first 30 pages and couldn’t stop for a good twenty minutes. The action scenes are engaging. The writing still moves with the dreamy beauty of a fairy tale. We learn more about Vasya’s legacy, which is just as mystical as readers of the series imagined. And yet I had some minor quibbles. I had some issues with Vasya this time around. Some of her choices, done on whims, have major consequences that are, for lack of a better word, aggravating. She has grown a lot since, but in this book, she seems more immature compared to when we first met her. The major choices just seemed un-Vasya. And the frost demon is almost a non-entity in the book. Granted, he is a fleeting presence in the first two books, but in here, he vanishes for a major portion of the story. However, the scenes between him and Vasya still have that sparkling chemistry, and there is one moment that had me internally screaming with joy. I have a huge crush on him and that love is never going away. I still love this series and see a lot of possibilities with spin offs (seriously, can we get a book about Morozko, please and thank you), I will treasure the series as it is. ________________________5-19-18: The publisher pushed the release date back to 2019... my...precious! :(-----------------------------------------------I want this book like Gollum wants the One Ring.
