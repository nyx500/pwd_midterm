The ka-tet of Roland, Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Oy continue to follow The Beam in their lengthy quest for the Dark Tower.  When all is said and done, their number will be fewer.  Roland's relentless search for the Dark Tower is nearing its end and it comes at a price.  Ahead, the Crimson King is in evidence, quite mad, crazed.  Mordred, following, is full of hatred and he is a'hungry.  A perfect rose, nineteen steps, a door.  The ending?  Sheer perfection, in my book.     This is by far my favorite series of any I have read.  The first five volumes have been read any number of times, and the last two tomes thrice now.  I may or may not reread this series again, but I have the books on my shelves here at home.  And they tinct and darkle ....An epic adventure like no other, told by a master storyteller.  And now, I bid thee long days and pleasant nights.
