“Sometimes you lie to deceive people. Sometimes you lie because you need the lie to become the truth.” If I were ten years younger, this book would blow my mind for sure. In The Ship of the Dead, Magnus, Sam, Alex and his fellas must stop Ragnarok before Loki starts sailing the ship. The beginning sounded promising and I could feel there're a lot of mind-blowing packages that were to come, but I felt a bit let down after halfway through this book. It was not what I expected, tbh.Quests after quests. Prophecies after prophecies. Isn't there anything new and fresh to put in? I wonder that after all this time the story goes on, it hasn't developed much. Yet many characters seem to grow up and learn some valuable life lessons, but the way Mr.Riordan manages to tell his story is just dull and boring. Anyway, some part of me still enjoyed it quite enough because I wanted to know the ending and how the gang pulls it off.“You’re a strange person.” “I prefer the term fabulously weird.” Although the ending is legit anti-climatic. Flyting? Seriously? In addition, toward the last 20%, the story goes so fast I could feel it without any consideration. What I liked in this book? Yeah, I kinda liked Alex even though he/she didn't captivate me that much in the second book but in this one, he incredibly stands out.“The world will end. The big picture cannot be changed. But in the meantime, as Loki once said, we can choose to alter the details. That’s how we take control of our destiny.” Ps. If there were any chance that this series would continue, please give me more Thor. I can't get enough of him.
