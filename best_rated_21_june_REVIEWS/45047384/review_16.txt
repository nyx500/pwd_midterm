This is one goddamn fairytale. An original one. Which won't be retold in such perfection. I can see authors trying to tell their versions of this fairytale in 2050. Even then, they will find this hidden in the internet archives that once a reviewer gramma wrote this and they would be low-key panicking whenever there's the feeling of thinking of rewriting this precious goddamn fairytale 😎There's this stepmother (mean, biased fairytale writers! Why only stepmothers are grouchy bad eh??!)...well, I repeat, there's this cruel, strict stepmother-like top organization which send formal check rounds to see if the orphanages were functioning prim and proper. A clueless prince is sent to an orphan home set miles away which an ocean (oh, Cerulean! Oh, it's a sea, not an ocean but the ocean is an ocean in the fairytale) seemingly keeps the living creatures (I meant that) in it separated from the rest of the world (sometimes I feel the word world is so undramatic. I wanted to use the universe or the galaxy. But that would not just fit.)So this prince arrives, gets entangled in a mess like situation which makes him feel like he's been made fun of, or not taken seriously at all, or just that he's been taken as someone easy to be with. And then there's this protective-as-heck-about-his-kids he. Yass, my he. The other he. (Stop it!) Nah. The he who's going to be the one who slow burns the grandma reviewer here with his being he. And these two hes will join forces in their fairy tale to actually fast burn the reader grandma towards the end with all their (beep..beep...beep). And then there's my (okay, they are my family now. So my. Mine.) I repeat, then there's my kids, oh the little naughty, cute, broken, scarred, beautiful, scary, wonderful, playful demons.(I didn't know I was the one who was going to write the retelling of this book. Nah. I would go and write the rest of this in my blog because GoodReads reviews are meant to have reviews...so here I go to my old blog. I have to write about the kids and the mayor and the two MCs!!!! 🙋 🎧 🧟 run don't walk away ⚔️ oh, she's sweet but a psycho 🎶 (Warning: this ain't a good review. Review? Forget it. It's just me going crazy about how much I love this book.)Still in a daze. Since 5th September. The night I finished up reading this book and I am going to write a review which betrays justice. Yes, I am the criminal book reviewer reviewing books like my life depends on it when in real it's real. (See what I mean?!)***Book hangover. My damon babies 💕😭🤗🤛🤛 Arthur. Linus. Phee. Talia. Even Calliope.****How can I ever get to get over this book?! 10 days after reading the book and I still feel the lump in my throat because I am still freaking happy and my feelings tend to crack like my heart cannot bear the love pain I have for the me-screaming-happy happy ending.Sorry, I don't think I will ever get to write a proper mean review about this book. Like ever. Because it always has its way to unravel the muscle fibres of my heart to distinct skeletal, smooth and cardiac. Yes, there's no going back!🙋
