Maybe I'm just a cold person but to me this book felt over the top with saccharine sweetness, went into overkill with the morality lessons, and the odd humor fell flat. I honestly almost gave up on this book at the 75% mark but at that point I figured I might as well just finish it out. The book starts off just with a weird humorous tone - the heads of the corporation that the main character, Linus, works for is referred to only as "Extremely Upper Management". I'm not making that up. So from that I assumed that this book was supposed to be somewhat farcical, which I was not expecting in an adult fantasy book, but I went with it. However for the record, this kind of humor is not my cup of tea.Once the story starts to actually get going, we are then hit left and right with lessons that the kids and Linus 'learn'. Here's a small sampling:"We should always make time for the things we like. If we don't, we might forget how to be happy.'"When something is broken, you can put it back together. It may not fit quite the same, or work like it did once before, but that doesn't mean it's no longer useful.""A home isn't always the house we live in. It's also the people we choose to surround ourselves with."These aren't bad lessons by any means, but they are simplistic, almost constant, and is a lot of 'telling' not 'showing' - something I expect to read in a YA book and/or Little Women (don't get me started on that book). And then at the end, what should have been sweet touching moments, I was just ready for the book to end. Especially when hate in a whole village is overcome by a couple of speeches, a gardening Mayor, and a hippie record store owner. I honestly would have rated this book lower, but it wasn't terrible as much as it was just NOT FOR ME.
