I really enjoyed this! It was filled with charming characters, children and adults alike, so much whimsy, a hint of romance, and was just an overall sweet read. However, I can't help but wonder how I would have felt about it had I not seen so much hype surrounding it. I think I would have liked it a bit more because while I enjoyed it a lot, my expectations were too high going in. That being said, I think that it was a very unique and fantastic read. Kind of like Miss Peregrine's but for adults in a way. I particularly enjoyed watching the main character contemplate what really matters in life and if the drudgery and routine of what he does every day is what he really wants, or if he can break out of that. Overall, a great read, but I do wish I hadn't had expectations going in.
