Audio version. My first Pratchett. Not sure why it took me so long, aside from my natural contrarian bent, to finally see what I had been missing. (time passes)This is really good. Intelligent, deeply amusing if not always clever, interesting plot and well-developed characters. In a way, quite like Robert Asprin in good form. More intelligent than most of Piers Anthonyâ€™s fantasy stuff and deeper. More British, yes. Quite British. Flagrantly, outlandishly British at times.
