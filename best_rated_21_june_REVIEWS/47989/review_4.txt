The AWESOMEST DISCWORLD BOOK, EVER! The layers, depth, dimensions, angles and edges that Pratchett gives to Sam Vimes is beyond awesome and reach their pinnacle in this novel as well as in Thud!, the next book in the Night Watch subseries."People are content to wait a long time for salvation, but prefer dinner to turn up inside an hour."â€œAnd so the children of the revolution were faced with the age-old problem: it wasn't that you had the wrong kind of government, which was obvious, but that you had the wrong kind of people." "His Grace, His Excellency, The Duke of Ankh; Commander Sir Samuel Vimes" has been my acknowledged, unconquerable Discworld/literary C*R*U*S*H ever since the 1st book about tge Night Watch, Guards! Guards!.I would choose him over Mr Darcy & that's saying somethin'. Shame none of the Watch-books were put to film, I could have imagined the divine Alan Rickman (R.I.P.) playing him to perfection.But the time has come to reveal my -so far- secret (hush)crush on Lord Vetinari.Why?A) He is awesome & unattainable & we would be totally mismatched as a couple.B) Terry Pratchett is genius.C) I blame Jeremy Irons & Charles Dance.D) All the above. I also love the relationship between Vimes & Vetinari, the grudging respect they have for on another:Night Watch is a brilliant book & my undisputed favourite of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch series (and believe me, I love them all).TIME / TIMING are given new dimensions with Vimes living on borrowed time, being behind/ahead of times at the same time.And he is literally walking down Memory Lane when he finds himself transported back 30 years earlier and has the terrifying/wonderful chance to teach his younger self (a rookie of the Night Watch) some policing while trying to deal with the sinister politics of those times and getting some support from the time Monks led by Lu Tze, the Sweeper.I loved meeting the young Vetinari, Rosie Palm, Dibbler, Nobby, Fred & Reg Shoe and also some new characters, like Mossy Lane, the "pox doctor" and Sandra Battye who is a real seamstress (&actually knows how to sew).
