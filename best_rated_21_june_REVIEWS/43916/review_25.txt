This was kind of a weird read in the sense that it started off as a somewhat YA novel: young magician apprentice saves princess who consequently falls in love with him and blahblahblah. Then, as the story unfolds, it takes a whole different road and it sort of becomes darker, leaving the whole YA flavor behind and switching to war and conspiracy. Overall, it's not bad; I guess "Magician" would have been a bit more enjoyable had it been, say, a couple of hundred page shorter. My two cents.
