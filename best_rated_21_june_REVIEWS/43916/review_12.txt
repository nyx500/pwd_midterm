5.5/10A book of two halves. Whilst meant to be read as one book this was split and published in certain areas as two books. If I could rate the two separately it would be 4 stars to the first part and 1.5 stars to the second part. The first half is a generic fantasy tale but it’s quite a good read. Feist isn’t a bad writer so whereas what could be seen as generic and bland is spiced up a little with the style of writing. Some of the characters are plain and stereotypical which lets things down but the plot moves fast and over a number of years so plenty is going on to keep your attention.Then the second half happened and I just wasn’t interested. I had to skim read to get through it. The thought of slogging through it for a couple of weeks didn’t appeal but I’d put in time an effort to read the first part so I wasn’t going to DNF it. I didn’t like how the characters acted and how the narrative changed styles, my interest was at a low. The ending was very sugary too, maybe reading ASOIAF and Abercrombie has made me want all fantasy characters to suffer. I’m now in two minds whether to read the follow up. Whilst not enjoying this one I have read a trilogy of Feist’s set later on in this world and did enjoy it. The next one may just be more appealing with a different set of characters, I’ll need to do some long hard thinking on that one.
