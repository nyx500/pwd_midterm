Read as part of The Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.I was looking forward to getting back in to fantasy. Lately, it's mostly been literature: classics, contemporary, genreless fiction-nothing particularly fantastical. This excitement was high, fantasy is my bread and butter. It is not the magic, or the made-up nature, nor indeed the plots. It is just everything about fantasy that makes me enjoy it. Usually, no matter what. Of course, going in to Magician I was filled with a deep sense of anticipation. But I was quickly disappointed. The first 150 pages or so are pure Lord of the Rings and I could not get past that. Beyond, the storyline expanded and went beyond the standard trope of fantasy that was-and sometimes still is-prevalant in high fantasy, but to no avail. I felt nothing for any character. They all seemed to have one or two traits, and nothing more. Their voices were similar, their ideals and morals seemed interchangeable. They were just characters, not people. I cared for none of them. Not relevant, and possibly petulant, but I hated the name Pug, and his other name, and couldn't seem to get past his stupid names. Futhermore, I do not think anything particular about the plot. Sometimes standard fantasy, sometimes beyond the norm, often with clich√©s and often unique and imaginative, but never enough to keep me interested. It just seemed as if things were just happening, as opposed to the characters actually influencing or making the plot happen. It just sort of stumbled along. And lastly, because I dislike taking any more time than its necessary in talking about a book I have not enjoyed, the writing was vague and mediocre. But standard fantasy, I think. Perhaps when it was first published, at some point in the 80s, it was nice and new and fun back then. But now, it just seems flat and dull.Blog | Reviews | Instagram | Twitter
