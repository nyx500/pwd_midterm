8/10It has been, litteraly, a really long time since I first wanted to read Feist' Magician and now, after hearing so much about this book, I finally got my hands on it I understand why after all these years it still remains so famous and lovable; as Feist manages from the very first page to win you and make you love the characters and the world.Of course, Feist’s writing in the first part has a lot of problems, and some clichés that may be a somewhat turndown for someone, but as it goes on the story becomes better and better and with the ending leaving you in suspense for the next part.The second part is more balanced with better narrative and with the story also becoming stronger, and making you love the characters even more.The only thing that bothered me a little is that Feist has, perhaps, put too much stuff in the book, even if considered a “double” book, and sometimes leaving a lot quickly behind. But with the fast pace he has managed to make a very entertaining story with lots of action and with good humor that makes you forget his flaws.Definitely a must read for fans of the fantasy genres and, if I may add, a classic!
