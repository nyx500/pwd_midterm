Just as enjoyable as when I read it as a kid - even more so. (There's definitely some nostalgia associated with my reception of this book!). I think the single volume of this book, rather than the 2-volume Magician: Apprentice and Magician: Master, hits a little better than the 2-volume version. It feels like a grander unified story that's greater in scale. 4.5/5
