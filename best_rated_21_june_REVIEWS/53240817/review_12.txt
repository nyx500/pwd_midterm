*climbs to the very top of a mountain, inhales and screams*: I LOVE THIS BOOOOOOOK.Amari and the Night Brothers has the potential to be the next big series - yes, it is really that good.- Follows Amari, a young Black girl who gets swept into a hidden magical world when she receives a briefcase from her missing brother - and she gets nominated to be a trainee at the Bureau of Supernatural Affairs. - This book is just so much fun!!! I loved how imaginative and creative and visual this book was. This was the sort of book that ignites your imagination and love for reading - and I can absolutely seeing this book being the book that gets young people into reading.- The story was amazing, and I just could not stop reading? Each time I picked up this book, I genuinely looked forward to where the author would take us next.- The characters were wonderful - especially Amari. She was such a wonderful protagonist who isn't perfect but is absolutely trying to do the right thing when she gets caught in a sticky situation.- I just loved that this was a magical school but mixed with elements of Men in Black. I loved the references to other magical works and mythologies and has paranormal elements too.- I just. I just really loved this. I really need this to become a big thing so that it can be adapted into a film! It'd be perfect.Trigger/content warning: mild fantasy violence
