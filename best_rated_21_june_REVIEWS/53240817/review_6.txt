This book is so much more than a young girl looking for her missing brother. It is a book about friendship and companionship, about perseverance and self-confidence. It is about the Black experience and how fear can so easily escalate to hate.I was immediately captured by this story. Amari is a character I desperately wish I had when I was younger and am so happy that young Black kids have this now. She is the true definition of Black girl magic! I loved her. She has such resilience and strong convictions and perseverance. When those around her told her she would never be good enough because of her differences, she took those words and used them to become even stronger. I also loved how Amari learned that not every battle is one you have to fight alone. Friends are a great reminder that we are not alone, that we have strength and courage and together we can do anything.As amazing as the characters are, the world-building of this was just as good! This is a true fantasy story! There are myths and legends that we are familiar with as well as new and innovative takes on classic fantasy characters and tropes we know. The plot and overall pacing of the book were fantastic as well! Every page kindled joy and continued to move the story along. It was never boring! There were also more plot twists in this book than some of the adult mystery/thrillers I've read! This is a book I can see becoming the next big thing and I desperately want it to! I cannot wait for the next installment in this!
