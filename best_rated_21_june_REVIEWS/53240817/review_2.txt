Check out my spoiler-free interview with author B. B. Alston on YouTube: https://youtu.be/_oF5Ma0vRZsA truly imaginative and explosive start to what promises to be an exciting new middle grade series to watch out for!Amari has felt rather lost since the disappearance of her brother, but when she discovers a strange suitcase in his room, she has no idea how much bigger his disappearance - and the world around her - actually are. Enter the Bureau of Supernatural Affairs, where Amari begins to train as a junior agent in a world where aliens, witches, dragons and way, way more exist. This book has all the makings of a beloved adventure, perfect for kids and adults who want a fresh dose of action in their life. I loved the opening up of this incredible new world that feels rather real, and there are so many possibilities with this world that I am extremely excited for what's to come. Amari is a hugely likeable protagonist who has faced oppression all her life, so she jumps at the opportunity to discover new things, but even more so to discover what happened to her brother. Amari ends up making some close friends whom I love, and other characters are rather complex too. There are some brilliant twists and turns by the end of the book, setting us up for a brilliant sequel to come.Plot-driven, action-packed, character-focused and just absolutely-brilliant.
