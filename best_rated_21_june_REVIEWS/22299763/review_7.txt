chapter 40 will always ruin me. nina and matthias deserve their own series. ______________________things i need in order to survive: air, food and water, this book. this book obviously being the most important item on that list. wow. i will tell you what, i must have been a saint in another life because i do not feel worthy of this book. i laughed, i cried, i yelled, i loved, i cheered, i swooned, i died. i felt every emotion humanly possible. i am so grateful to live in a world where this duology exists. <3â†  5 stars
