What would have been 5 stars...I now leave at merely 3...I ADORED book one. And, being that for years now I have heard nothing but how book two was even better and so supposedly beyond amazing, I was fully expecting to adore this one too. And, welp... I wish I could say the story fell apart and slogged along or that I was bored. But again...Nope. The plot here was just as rousing as the first book, I loved the characters, etcetera, etcetera...So why am I not rating it 5 stars you ask?***spoiler alert***Because, folks, I am BITTER.I am bitter that Bardugo, for whatever ill-advised reason, decided she would try to be George R. Martin and kill off a main character. And, unlike GRR, it just didn't fit. It served the story in NO way. In fact, it was SO beyond random that it felt like it was added on later. Truly though, it was so utterly senseless that I just couldn't even believe it happened after I read it and saw no "just kidding" footnote at the bottom of the page. And, quite frankly, it just took the wind right out of my Love For This Series Sails. I felt like Bardugo betrayed the reader, her characters, and the series as a whole. And to anyone who says, "But Val, it's completely unrealistic for ALL of the crew to have lived through it all," I say I DON'T CARE. I don't read Young Adult FANTASY for the "realism" of it. In addition to that, I also felt like Kaz wasn't as magnetic in this book as he was in the first book. The team didn't feel as "team-like" as it did in the first book. And I just wasn't happy with the way the whole thing ended. It felt kind of abrupt and unfinished and I felt like the characters were all left unmoored instead of bound together, especially poor Nina. But as I said, I'm mostly just bitter.
