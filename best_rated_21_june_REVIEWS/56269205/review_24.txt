I'm pulling the plug on this one for the moment at 36%. This isn't an official DNF. I may pick it up again later. I mean, I am not in a rush about it, but it could happen.I'm just not into it at the moment. There's nothing inherently wrong with it. I like the set-up and the writing is lush, with dark, descriptive elements.However, it is requiring way more brain power than I am willing to invest in it right now. This definitely has a heavy, epic fantasy feel, which I generally love, but yeah, I am not tracking any of the names, or events, currently. Perhaps at another time it will work better for me.Goodbye for now to these characters. I hardly knew you!Original:ARC received!!! Day made!!! Commence freaking out!!!Thank you so much, St. Martin's Press. I absolutely cannot wait to devour this!
