4.5 stars In Empire of the Vampire we are following the infamous Black Lion, Gabriel de Leon, as he recounts his life story to a historian shortly before he is executed for the murder of the Forever King.Throughout the course of the book, Gabriel tells his story across 2 timelines - his early days being initiated into the Silversaints, a holy order dedicated to fighting back against the creatures of night, and over a decade later, as he stumbles into an old friend and joins her quest to find the Holy Grail, the only thing prophesied to end the endless night.I enjoyed this a lot. The dreary atmosphere was unparalleled, I loved Gabriel and enjoyed the parallels between his youth as a naive young boy full of hope and his early thirties, where he is a bitter man who has lost all faith I loved the elements of found family (as always) and my favourite characters were the lordly Aaron de Coste and the wily Dior LaChance. I also found that I was absorbed from page one and blasted through this chunky tome in a handful of days.All of this being said, this one slightly missed the mark for me, hence the 4.5 star rating. I felt like this wasn't anything particularly new from Kristoff. Many paralells can be drawn between this and Nevernight (one of my favourite series of all time) and nothing took me by surprise because everything that unfolded was everything I expect from a Kristoff novel.While there are no footnotes in this one, the world building was disclosed in a similar style, with our historian Jean Francois frequently stopping Gabriel's narration to remind him that he should recount the story "as if to a child", after which, Gabriel would roll his eyes and explain what the term he used means. I felt that while in Nevernight, this form of world building can be written of as a stylistic choice, it read to me like disjointed and lazy in Empire of The Vampire.Personal preference wise, I really don't like books that heavily feature real-world religion, and while the One Faith is fantastical, it is clearly very heavily modelled off Christianity. This put me off a bit, purely based on my own preferences, but I will say that by the time I reached the page 450 mark, it had stopped bothering me.So overall, I liked it a lot, I think it's very good. The world was immersive, the story was compelling and evoked emotion, I was rooting for the characters, but it kind of feels like I've read it before.
