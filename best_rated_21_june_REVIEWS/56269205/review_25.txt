I received a 400 pages SAMPLER of this book via NetGalley (thank you St Martin's Press). All thoughts and opinions are my own. *This is a review for the whole book, not just the sampler*  ✅ Great writing✅ Cruel and vicious vampires✅ Beautiful cover✅ Thorough world-building ✅ Dark atmosphere✅ Characters✅🆗 Pace❗️❗️ This is not a book for kids, it is bloody, vulgar, and dark.4.5 starsThere is a time for grief, and a time for songs, and a time to recall with fondness all that has been and gone. But there is a time for killing too. There is a time for blood, and a time for rage, and a time to close your eyes and become the thing heaven wants you to be. This book is gritty, bloody, and deliciously dark. Gabriel is the last of the Silversaints, a group of holy vampire hunters, and the book starts right after he is captured by Her Grace Margot Chastain, the Undying Empress of Wolves and Men. Marquis Jean-Francois Chastain, the Empress’ historian, has been tasked with writing a detailed account of Gabriel's life before his execution and the book is about that. I admit that I was a little wary when I realized that this whole book would be about Gabriel reminiscing and telling his story to Jean-François... For one, I am not a fan of flashbacks in books, and I was afraid that I wouldn’t be as involved in the story knowing that no matter what happened, Gabriel would obviously survive since he was still very much alive (although captive and on his way to his execution) and able to tell his story, but I was positively surprised by the result. I was sucked into this book after a few pages only, thanks to the amazing writing and dark ambiance. The pace is good, the plot is intriguing enough to keep me hooked and the time jumps were very well written and not confusing. The weaving of the present timeline and Gabriel’s past was greatly done and I really enjoyed reading about his journey. I have to say though, that you really need to be in “the right mood” for this type of darker and heavier book if you want to really enjoy it.The writing is also definitely a strength (not to say the strength) of this book. It is dark and lyrical, but it was not too much or too descriptive. Be aware that the dialogues are vulgar though and there is a lot of blasphemy. There was a good balance of descriptions, action, and snark, and I LOVED IT. There’s a beast in all men’s blood, Gabriel. You can starve him. Cage him. Curse him. But in the end, you pay the beast his due, or he takes his due from you. Gabriel is a very snarky main character and he doesn’t seem to give a shit about anything. Because of his antagonistic attitude towards almost everyone, it was a little hard to get to know him and to care for him at first, but I just love his “I don’t give a shit and I’m not taking any shit from you either” attitude. His interactions with the other characters made me smile and even laugh a few times. He just decided that he would treat people the way they deserved it, and it so happen that most people deserve to be treated like shit, according to him.Gabriel reached into his battered britches, fished about under the monster’s stare. Finally, he retrieved a tarnished royale from his pocket. “Here.”“What is that for?” Jean-François demanded.“I want you to take this coin to market, and buy me a fuck to give.” While everyone sees Gabriel as a hero, this notion seems to annoy him. He knows that he is good at slaying vampires, but he has no illusion about his character’s worth: he is far from being a hero in shining armor, ready to sweep in to save a damsel in distress. He laughs out loud when people call him a hero and does not hesitate to set the records right and let them know that he’s no hero at all. He is ruthless, brutal, and cold (and drunk sometimes), but more than that, he is a survivor. The fact that he is fierce has a magical sword that can communicate with him telepathically, has magical tattoos, and is a half-vampire hell-bent on eradicating the scum of the world also makes him all the more cool and badass. “’God didn’t want me. And the devil was too afraid to open the door.’ The world-building is also great. The descriptions and lyrical writing do help to create a dark ambiance and I could picture the cities and people very vividly (the map at the beginning of the book also helps). There are also some black and white awesome artworks by Bon Orthwick throughout the book showing us the characters, which made it all feel even more real.Law the First, “The dead cannot kill the Dead.”Law the Second, “Dead tongues heeded are Dead tongues tasted”Law the Third, “The Dead run quick”Law the Fourth, “The Dead feel as beasts, look as men, die as devils.”Law the Fifth, “Even the Dead have laws.”While this book doesn't end with a cliffhanger, there are some twists near the end and some revelations that shocked me and I am very excited to know what awaits Gabriel in the next book.**Just some extra infos**The four vampire bloodlines: Blood Voss: House of the Forever King.
