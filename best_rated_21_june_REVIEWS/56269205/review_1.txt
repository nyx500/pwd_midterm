EMPIRE OF THE VAMPIRE is not a book for children. It's basically what would happen if INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE hooked up with NAME OF THE WIND  in an S&M club while all eight seasons of GAME OF THRONES streamed in the background (consecutively not simultaneously). It is not a book for children.It concerns an ex-monster-slayer named Gabriel de León, who was once quite-the-awesome but has been having a tough time of late and has become a bit of an edgelordbut he mostly gets away with his drunken "I am the night" routine, because who doesn't like a tall, dark, half-vampire dude with magic tattoos and a tragic past and beautiful hair, honestly, that shit is money in the bank where's my Emmy.Before you ask, the vampires in it do not sparkle.Not that I have anything against vampires that sparkle, anyone working in publishing in 2020 owes Stephenie Meyer an enormous debt of gratitude—I don't care if they were your jam, the TWILIGHT books brought an entire generation of folks back to reading and many of them stayed, vampires aren't real and if an author decides they sparkle in sunlight or jizz rainbows when someone plays Halsey on the radio, who gives a damn, just say "as you like it, madame" and roll on with your day.But yeah, my vampires don't so much sparkle as murder you and your whole motherfucking family, and the only reason they pursue 16 year old girls (or indeed anyone else) in this book is because vampires see them as food.(Team Damon 4 life btw)The book is quite long.It's rather violent.It's somewhat gay. Like, not Orange is the New Black gay, but you're talking to the man who wrote Mia fucking Corvere, I'm building up to it, give me some goddamn credit.It is quite smutty and bloody. "Bloodsmutty" if you will. Honestly, there's a blood-drinking blowjob scene in there, so if that's not your thing, just back slowly out of the room while avoiding eye contact, I won't be offended (Hi, Mum).It is, as I may have previously mentioned, not a book for children.It will be illustrated! Though I can't talk much more about that until next year. But, it's pretty epic.Like "best book I've ever written" epic.I mean fuuuuuuuckingepic.But it's not a book for children. So, if the bookstore puts it in the wrong section alongside ILLUMINAE and you find your baby reading it whilst bleeding from the eyes, before you send me an angry mail, pls consider that I warned you.Hope you love it.
