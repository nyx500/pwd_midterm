Star Rating: â€”> ALL. OF. THE. STARS. (!)[ But if we have to get technical/ official here... FIVE(5) bright, bursting with light, Stars ! ]ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸ðŸ–¤ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸RE-READ 2!â€” 02/03/23 Literally having a reading crisis atm so I picked this up, cause I can never get enough of this book, this world. Also, apparently, it is the month of reading 600-750 page books ðŸ˜‚RE-READâ€” 12/15/21 [ Well, f*ck. my. face. (!) FIVE (5), bursting with light, & lifeblood, Stars, again, of course. What other outcome would you expect ?! ðŸ˜‰ ]ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸ðŸ–¤ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸Which, quite honestly, I know that may sound pretty odd, given how dark as night this novel was, but every single aspect of it was a bright & incredible light in my eyes. I mean, the signature Kristoff move of holding your heart in a vise and adjusting it as he sees fit, in a cycle over & over & over... think, for a moment, on how you'd let loose your heart to end up in that vise in the first place. Some sort of witchery? Perhaps. But honestly, that is just a mark of an incredible f*cking story & an incredible f*cking storyteller.TORTUOUS GD genius that he is! You'd think that it would be just plain painful... but no, nope, not a chance. For all the pain, there was so much utter bliss (not so much for the characters, though, because they face all manners of hardship for just a drop of happiness, it feels like...), in reading this absolutely fantastic tale.Who doesn't love to cheer for the underdog? For the Fallen Hero? (Especially the ones who bite back, & bite back, our Fallen Hero & MC, Gabriel De LeÃ³n, most assuredly, & certainly, does.ðŸ˜‰) There is a certain kind of bliss, indeed, in this, because it begets emotions & a Hope so strong, that every moment, every minor detail, may as well be as important as the breath you breathe, itself.This, my friends, is the very moment where you've made the decision to put your heart in the author's hands. Where every beat of said heart becomes dependent on the fate of the characters, the story being told, the words on the page. Yes, it becomes a truly euphoric addiction, of sorts. Kristoff is a master of this very specific sort of addiction. He sucks you in off the damn bat (i'm so sorry for my two terrible vampire puns there, but I HAD TO. Haha), and once he does? I believe you know what happens. The secret is in the telling, as they say. But... GAH HOW DARE HE?!?? (yeahhhhâ€”i'm totally just kidding on that one, something MAJOR, haha; I have come to expect this treatment from Mr. Kristoff, but keep coming back for more! I stopped asking that particular question a long while ago. So; yep. Hypocrite, I am not ðŸ˜‚). My eyes & cheeks are stained with tears, and yet, IT WAS SO DAMN WORTH IT. Why was it so worth it, you ask?      â€œâ€˜A little pain never hurt anybody, eh?'"    Pretty sure that's Kristoff's motto in life ðŸ˜‚. Gotta love himâ€”because there is probably, IMHO, never a statement as true as this. There is no light without darkness. Life is an endless circle of positives & negatives, and one can never exist without the other. And to embrace it? That takes an immense amount of strength. It is proof that we have livedâ€”that we are STILL living, still alive... we are survivors.My instant gratification filled self does NOT know how I am going to wait for only God knows how long for another TOME in this dark, savage, gritty, sarcastic as all hell, heart-killing, heart-warming (yeah, that sounds like a joke to me as well, but it is heart-warming, when it's not, you know, tearing your heart out), series. The hardcover copy of this book is A GIANT that looks 1000+ pages longâ€”but, no, it is only around 750 pages which go much faster than I could've ever imagined.I was so utterly enthralled with this PHENOMENAL novel that I read it in one day (!) from mid afternoon to 11 PM with only a break for dinner and whatnot; that is how just absolutely insanely gripping this was; just... *smh* how damn astounding this was. And the ending... oh my God, that f*cking ending...Holy. Shit. Just... Holy Freaking Shit!!!Goodnessâ€” I just have no more words, atm. This is something you absolutely have to hold in your own hands & read with your own eyes. BUTâ€” I just have to say... it really is just BLOODY BRILLIANT, just... an absolute masterpiece ! (Like, possibly one of the best books i've ever read in my entire lifeâ€”and I assure you, I have read a metric SH*T TON of books in my lifeðŸ˜‚; way more than it shows on GR because I only started using it in 2017â€”level Brilliant, with a capital f*cking B !)100% recommend to new adult & adult dark fantasy lovers. Possibly even upper level YA readers, as well. AND of course, all of the vampire-loving heathens like me out there ! Haha. JUST READ THIS ALREADY!!! You WILL NOT regret it. ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸ðŸ–¤ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸Well, if you don't like adult themes such as the following, this may not be the one for you: sexual situations, cursing (although if you were one who doesn't appreciate those so-called foul words, I don't think you'd have even made it this far through my review ðŸ˜‚), like LIT-ER-ALLYâ€” LOADS & LOADS & LOADS & then some, of cursing/ foul language (I love it! Haha), graphic depictions of violence/ torture-ish(?), ideations of suicide on maybe one or two occasions, depictions of drug & alcohol addiction & withdrawal, death, lots & lots of death (don't want to say of who or what as to not spoil any of the story)... gah & if there is anything else that I remember later, i'll be sure to add it! ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸ðŸ–¤ðŸ©¸ðŸ©¸_____________________F*CK. TO. THE. YES !I had this marked as want to read when it was untitled, bc pfffft câ€™mon- Kristoffffff, but id be lying if i didnt say i was FLIPPING MY SHIT ATMSO excited.
