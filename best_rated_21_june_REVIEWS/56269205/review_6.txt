Two things I can say about this book:1)This is definitely not for children as Jay Kristoff mentioned on Goodreads review.2)This is more than vampire story: it’s about losing your belief, your life purpose, your inner source of light, your compass! So far I can honestly say this is the best thing the author wrote. And I want to read the rest of it ! The world building, the clear, dark, wild, haunted depictions, emotional depth of characters are pure perfection! I was up all night and my head feels like still swimming inside an aquarium but it’s totally worth the entire mental exhaustion! Special thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin’s Press for sharing this arc in exchange my honest thoughts.
