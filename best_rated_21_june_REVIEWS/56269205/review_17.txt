i feel like this book is just purely based off of aesthetics and it almost got me too, i was loving Gabriel in the being, he’s like Geralt from The Witcher mixed with Klaus from TVD and i was eating it up at first. But as the book went on i began to not care, I don’t care for the side characters and i was getting bored. I noticed that Jay Kristoff focused on his flowery writing and aesthetics more than anything else and that was my problem with Nevernight as well. This book does remind me of Interview with the Vampire, i found that book very boring without plot. Sadly, this book is the same but what makes it worse is that it’s 700 pages so it just feels like it drags on. I really hope that the sequel focuses on plot because even though i don’t mind characterization the entire book, 700 pages of it with no plot is jusy unnecessary. Everyone wants to write a tomb but just because it’s big doesn’t mean it’s worth 5 stars.
