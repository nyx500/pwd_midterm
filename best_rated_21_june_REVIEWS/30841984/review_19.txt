This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionActual Rating: 4.25-4.5 stars “WHEN WE SEEK TO RULE ONLY OURSELVES, WE ARE EACH OF US KINGS.” 🌟 If you have been following my latest posts, and specifically my book discussions. I talked about my YA crisis in the latest one and how books are all becoming the same to me. I have been reading more adult books and Kings of the Wyld have been on my radar for a while. It has been getting mostly good reviews and I think it deserves the hype.🌟 What is this book about? I feel I can’t pass the opportunity to explain this because this is very unusual and very new. Contrary to the common sterotypical main characters in literature, the characters here were famous back in the day. They were one of the most famous mercenary groups called Saga, the group basically disassembled and now they are getting back together for one more adventure!🌟 The writing is unique and I am not sure if it can be called satire as I have never read that but it certainly was hilarious. To mix fantasy with humor is quite a daunting task because they are 2 polar opposites and the author did a great job in getting a good balance. It kind of had the Funny but serious Marvel movies vibes to it. Sometimes I would have preferred if the author took a more serious tone because it would have worked a little bit better than humor. However, for most of the book, I did enjoy it and did not mind it. However, I think readers should go into it expecting this.  “You should write a book,” Matrick suggested. Kit snorted. “Who wants to read the self-pitying lamentations of an old revenant?” “There’s your title right there,” said Ganelon.” 🌟 The characters were my favorite part of the story, we have old, fat, drunk, loud, obnoxious and silly old men who were glorious back in the day. Clay is the nice one, Gabe is a leader, Moog is my favorite and is like the comic relief in the group, Ganelon is the powerful one and Matrick is a drunk cuckold king. Talk about creativity!!  “As individuals they were each of them fallible, discordant as notes without harmony. But as a band they were something more, something perfect in its own intangible way” 🌟 The pacing is good, It was not fast but it did not stretch out either. The endings of each chapter left me wanting more and more and so it was easier to go through than expected. I need to mention that chapter 49 was AMAZING!!! And the last chapters after that were all great.🌟 Summary: Kings of the Wyld was an unusual read in a very good way. I like the writing, the characters and the whole idea of this book is just creative. I also liked the closure of the story and it left me completely satisfied. I will be getting Bloody Rose and reading it soon!
