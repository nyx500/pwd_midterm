Reading Vlog: https://youtu.be/MLxlIc-hQisOkay, I see what all the hype is about! I absolutely loved this. If you're looking for a smart fantasy with a kick-ass mom, nuanced characters, and interesting magic and politics, you should definitely pick up The Sword of Kaigen. This was immaculate and such a pleasant surprise. One thing to know is that while most of the book takes place on an island that functions as a patriarchial society a la feudal Japan, it's set in a modern world and people from the outside bring in more modern ideas and technology. Misaki is among my favorite characters of 2022 and we so rarely get the perspective of women in fantasy who are mothers and not 20. I won't say too much more here since a video is forthcoming, but I loved this.
