Best book I read in 2020.I haven't reviewed this book and I don't think I'll do it justice even if I tried to, but all I can say this book was amazing. I loved that it's told from two point of views: a mother and her son. It's also standalone which is very rare in this genre. I rated only 3 books 5 full stars this year (and another was rounded up from 4.5 to 5). Sword of Kaigen was also memorable and something I'd consider rereading in the future. I know I'll be reading any new book M.L. Wang writes. I wish her success. This book deserves more recognition, honestly. I'm very glad it's getting more spotlight. It wasn't perfect -sure there were some flaws- but it was damn close.I recommend it to all fantasy fans. ----------First 5 stars of 2020!! Took me long enough. Wonderful book, why isnâ€™t it more popular?!
