This book was PHENOMENAL. I finished it in under 24 hours because I literally COULD NOT put it down. Cassandra Clare concluded such an amazing series in such a beautiful way. I didn't think it was possible to cry more happy tears than sad tears when finishing off your absolute favorite series, but somehow, this novel was too amazing for me to dwell in the few sad parts and forced me to embrace all it had to offer. I thought I'd be broken with the end of The Mortal Instruments, but I am so happy knowing the fates of the characters I've come to love and feeling the security of knowing that one of the greatest works of YA literature ever written has ended as wonderfully as it started.
