This reread was so needed since I forgot some major plot points. But it was also nice to get back into this world with these sets of characters. More than nice. And that ending still had me gassed! 😍Cannot wait for book 3 is the most understated statement. I’m dying to know what Sarah J Maas has planned. ————————————So when the thing happened that everyone was screaming about, you had better understand I screamed. At midnight. I was thrashing around like a damn cartoon character. The excitement! The happiness! The pain! Oh boy! I’m gonna be dreaming about that ending. About this book full stop. Everything about this book shined! The plot, the characters, the side characters, the romance. It all came together perfectly. It's such a vast and vivid story.I can’t wait to reread this. I’ve been in a trance for over a week (the time I’ve spent reading this book) and I don’t want to wake up. But the possibilities now… 🤭 I could choke with excitement! I’m buzzing! ——————————————— I’m in no way ready for what this book will do to me. But I can’t wait for my emotions to be put through the ringer. Expect relentless updates. It’ll be my version of therapy. ✌🏾Buddy-reading with my support group - Azrah & Türkan! 🌙
