Reread 2020. I’ve decided to unhaul these hardbacks. Maybe get them on kindle on sale. I’m just not feeling them like I used to I spent much of my life guarding my heart. I guarded it so well that I could behave as though I didn’t have one at all. Even now, it is a shabby, worm-eaten, and scabrous thing. But it is yours. 🖤Omg! That cover! I’m feeling all magical inside! 💕🌸🦄Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
