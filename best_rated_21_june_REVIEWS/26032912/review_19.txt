wow WOW wOW Wow IM OBSESSED and so sad Iâ€™m now done with this series ðŸ˜­ this book and this whole series was SO GOOD!! I love the politics, the world, our main character Jude, and THE ROMANCE. I could read 3829272 more books with these characters and this world.This book was my favorite in the series because it was so fast paced and always kept me guessing. I was so stressed towards the end with how everything could possibly get resolved. I also love that there are so many morally grey characters in this series. Basically Every character has flaws which I love & makes it feel so much more realistic.A series hasnâ€™t made me feel like this in a long time.
