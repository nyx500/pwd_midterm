Wait. Am I dumb? Why don’t I understand the ending?Eh, whatever. I wasn’t reading for the plot anyway. 😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏However, I will say (in a non-spoilery way) it was clear to me this entire series that Moning was writing by the seat of her pants without any clear direction of where she was going. For example, it wasn’t until this book that Mac mentioned feeling bipolar her entire life (I won’t get into the gross misuse of that term). She kept saying that she always felt like she had split personalities in high school, which is maybe why *insert one of Mac’s several theories about the Book here.* Yet, Mac had never mentioned feeling bipolar in any of the other books. The bipolar thing was necessary for the plot of book 5 though, so it felt like Moning just threw it in and we were suppose to just accept that Mac had been struggling with this all along.Another thing that irritated me was the sudden epiphanies Mac would have. They would come out of nowhere. Suddenly she knew all of the answers.Literally no one:Mac: Omg. Now I know who I am and what Barrons is and the motivations of the Fae and Unseelie and why the Book taunts me and the meaning of life.It was lazy writing. Very Gossip Girl-esque (that show ALWAYS did the epiphany thing).  But, I watched every damn season of GG and enjoyed the hell out of it. Same goes for this series.Because, once again, I wasn’t reading for plot (😏) and, therefore, was not expecting a literary masterpiece. I find that approach makes fluff much more entertaining. 😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
