GUYS, PLEASE DON'T KILL ME! It seems I am not having luck with these "spin-off" versions of my favorite series'. First ACOSF and now this one too 😭❌ I WASN'T PULLED into the plot and characters as much as I expected to be. There were a lot of similarities to FBAA so it didn't feel like a new and exciting story to me🆗 SERA WAS A TOTAL badass and I really did enjoy that. I felt like JLA did a great job making a strong female that didn't take shit from anyone and I almost always enjoy a sassy heroine. BUT, after a while, I was definitely getting annoyed with her rashness and how she just wasn't thinking before opening her mouth or making decisions🆗 THE TENSION AND BANTER between Sera and Nyktos was A+ for a while, but there's a certain point where too much banter just feels like arguing. I think we reached that point in this book❌ THERE WAS TOO MUCH dialogue in this book. A lot of the conversations were longgg back and forth Q&A sessions between Sera and Nyktos and they just dragged on and on for me"I have so many questions."✅ THE HEAT AND THE ROMANCE were one of the redeeming things about this book. JLA sure knows how to write these sexy new-adult style high fantasy novels and I love it!❌ SOMEONE PLEASE GET ME a dictionary of this world 😵 The terminology was so similar to FBAA but at the same time different? The Handmaiden. The Chosen. The Rite. The Ascension. Gods and Primals that seem like Atlantians? Possibly Craven which might be called Gyrms or Hunters or something? It's all similar but in a different context and now I'm just confused❌ I FELT LIKE AN IDIOT because outside of the one prophecy at the end, I was not able to connect much between the two. I think it would have helped if I re-read TCOGB shortly before picking this up because it's been a while and I definitely forgot a lotHonestly, I didn't know what to expect going into this book but even with unclear expectations, I was still disappointed. Overall, I still recommend you read this if you enjoyed the original FBAA series and hopefully you will like it more than I did 😊Steam Scale: 🔥🔥🔥🔥/5Swoon Scale: ❤️❤️/5
