THIS WAS SO GOOD AND I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL ABOUT ITThis was delightfully dark and creepy and was the perfect fairy tale collection for a universe I have come to love. Leigh Bardugo is not only incredible at writing novels, she also writes outstanding shorter pieces. Her writing style is perfect for fairy tales. I'M OBSESSED. Also THE ILLUSTRATIONS oh my goodness I could not stop marvelling at them and how they formed a frame around the pages and something was added every time you flipped the page until the story was complete. It made for such an enhanced reading experience. All of these tales are 5/5 stars honestly, but here they are in order of favourite to least favourite. 1. The Too-Clever Fox2. The Soldier Prince3. The Witch of Duva4. Ayama and the Thorn Wood5. When Water Sang Fire6. Little Knife (this one actually might be closer to 4/5 stars, it was kind of boring)For any fan of the grishaverse, this is a MUST read IMO. Whenever you read it, doesn't matter, just do it (personally I would read it after having read at least one of the books set in this universe, so then you're already familiar with the world and this just enhances your understanding).
