STORY. WAS. PERFECT.-	I read this before on its own and it gave me chills then and it fricken gave me chills now-	Leigh Bardugo, never stop writing please-	Frick, that plot twist, I totally didn’t see it coming and it shook me up real good-	I love the whole ‘apperance vs. reality’ theme going on in this collection, but this one was especially epic and haunting and chilling and just AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-	Im going to go scream into a viod bc this one was just unmatched and it made me want to die at the same time Little Knife ~ 4 stars-	Leigh must be a magician bc the way she crafts the stories and makes you so attached to the characters in less than 60 pages is just magical -	Really enjoyed this story too -	The build up was done really well and then the ending is so unexpected-	We always hear those tales that are like, omg yes, we all know whats going to happen and the tale just drags along but no leigh is here to school you-	Bc you don’t end her books, they end youThe Solider Prince ~ 4 stars-	This one was really twisted and slightly confusing but still just as magical and enthralling as the others -	It took me some time to full grasp what the plot was bc it was spread over a vast amount of time-	But the way the characters are crafted, they just come to life man, idk what this sorcery is -	Really creepy, really eerie, all-round entertaining When Water Sand Fire ~3.5 stars-	This story is like a hit or miss I feel -	Perhaps the moral/build-up of the story went right above my head-	But a lot of the time, I was just trying to grasp what was going on bc the whole thing is basically showed not told and yes that’s an incredible thing to do but it also made me slightly confused-	NOT TO SAY THAT IT WASN’T A GREAT ONE-	Just that I wasn’t involved until the 60% mark -	But still managed to be magical and sad and an epic backstory of kinds-	Also apparently the darkling was supposed make an appearance here ???? im confused ???Also the drawings were epic and I basically screamed everytime I saw them bc wow thank you for blessing my eyes4 stars!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Buddy read with a little boi and fake may honestly it's leigh bardugo, so its an automatic 4 stars just for that~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~LETS JUST TAKE A COLLECTIVE MOMENT TO BREATHE BC WHAT IS THIS WHY AM I ONLY FINDING OUT ABOUT IT NOW THIS IS SO DISRESPECTFUL HOW DARE YOU RUIN MY HEART AGAIN LEIGH
