So, I'm having a WTF-did-I-really-give-this-a-three-star-rating moment. I honestly thought I was going to love this! (See my excitement below!)And since I pretty much converted to Bardugo-ism last year, I thought, that's it. This woman can write whatever, and it'll be perfect and as if I've been handed a slice of heaven itself. I mean, she's queen. All hail! This collection just did not do it for me. It could be my slumpish mood... however, I did enjoy some of the stories, The Witch of Duva in particular, but the majority were slightly mediocre to me. Nothing about the stories blew my mind, nor could I connect to them on any level. Usually with other short stories that I have read, the characterisations are on par. They feel alive and I would be craving for more. They would have had the potential to become full-fledged novels to me. With these stories, however, I was just glad they ended. It wasn't even that the book itself was bad, because there is no way that I can fault the writing, or the eeriness these stories possessed. Just that it wasn't for me. Initial reaction.THAT COVER!!! I cannot WAIT to read this book! My mind is still obsessing over how INCREDIBLE the Six of Crows duology was. Give it to me, Bardugo!
